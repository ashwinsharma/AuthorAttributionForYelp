      "[{'text': \" test for Vietnamese places is usually pho but it was 95 degrees outside and it was definitely too hot for soup.  So as I checked out the menu, this one item stood out to me...Spicy lemongrass vermicelli.  Added a bit of chicken to go with it.\\n\\nService was exceptional here.  Both servers waited on me and were happy to answer any questions I had on the menu and the restaurant.\\n\\nThe food came out and it came out and I was impressed.  Veggies and chicken were stir-fried before placed on top which gave them a really enjoyable flavor.  The chicken was tender and there was just enough spice to the dish that I really didn't have to add anything else.\\n\\nI think Doan's is definitely better than one of the other Vietnamese places on South Blvd. I'll have to come back again to see if they can top the other place.\\nI was here to celebrate a friend's birthday.  Actually I've been here a few times prior but never wrote a review.  Here's my chance!  \\n\\nWe met on the back patio.  They also have a front p\\natio which is for dining.  The back patio has its own bar, a deck and various patio sports activities like ping pong and cornhole.   The deck is really relaxing.  There's a shade tree (I think it's oak) that keeps everything cool.\\n\\nFor food, their wings are great and I also order a veggie club that was amazing.\\n\\nThis is a great Plaza/Midwood neighborhood place but like other places in the area parking is horrible.  Be prepared to walk if the area is busy!!\\nI've lived near Ru San's for 9 years and only recently have I started coming here.  What the heck was wrong with me?\\n\\nIt's a fun place.  I enjoy sitting in front of the sushi chefs and watching them work.  There are also several booths around the restaurant if you like that sort of thing.\\n\\nThe menu is extensive with sushi options as well as japanese dinner specialties.  I am always craving something spicy and the firecracker roll is one of my favorites.  Also the Firecracker shrimp appetizer is great as well.\\n\\nI've found the wait sta\\nff to be hit or miss but the sushi chefs are friendly.   \\n\\nThere are two flaws here.  One it's two loud an two, I think they are a bit pricy.  But the food is wonderful.  I think I found my regular sushi place.\\nI know I did a review of this previously...just not sure what happened to it.  Oh well, it was time for an update anyway.\\n\\nI've been here a couple times for lunch and dinner.  I've always though their food was good.  It's the service that usually lacks as was the case today.  \\n\\nI was craving pizza for lunch and Italian pie was my goal.  This was actually the 2nd place I went to.  The first place which was nearby was just a circus and I drove around 10 minutes trying to find a parking space.  So it was op to Plan B, Librettos.  \\n\\nJudging by Brian's review, I expected the place to be closed but it was open and the front was quite busy.  The back had a large group and 2 other tables occupied.  I was seated back there.\\n\\nI ordered a slice of pepperoni pizza and a slice of sausage piz\\nza and an order of garlic knots.  The knots came out right away and they were chewy with a great marinara sauce.   The slices took a while to come out.  How hard is it to heat up 2 slices?\\n\\nAnyway, finally they arrived.  Both were large slices, not as large as other places but still respectable.  The pepperoni was crisp but all the slice was quite greasy.  And it lacked sauce.   The dough was quite good but I was left to dip it in the leftover sauce from the knots.  The sausage slice was less greasy and the sausage was thick and tasty but this slice also lacked sauce.   Is there a shortage on pizza sauce these days?\\n\\nAnyway, it still satisfied my craving but I'd love to find a locally owned place that is generous on sauce on their pies.  Man cannot live on dough alone!\\nWoohoo, Another food truck hits the Queen City!\\n\\nI had the opportunity to try this one at my usual watering hole.   This truck does not specialize in just one type of food but has quite an interesting selection on the me\\nnu.  On this day, they had a reuben, Spicy beef sliders, Ramen Chicken stir-fry and a few other main dishes.  They also had a decent selection of sides including risotto balls and a kale salad.\\n\\nI ordered the reuben and the risotto balls.  This also came with chips.  The rueben was very tasty.  It wasn't smothered with thousand island dressing but instead they added dijon mustard whih made the meat and the kraut stand out.  The bread was toasted without being greasy.  \\n\\nThe risotto balls were ok.  I am not a big rice fan but I did break out of my comfort zone for these.  The chips however were great.  They are fried in the truck and lightly salted.  \\n\\nI had a chance to chat with the owner who explained why he uses dijon on the rueben instead of thousand island and also why he decided to not stick to one type of food.  \\n\\nSo far I am impressed.  I hope to see more of this truck.\\nWith 2 other Mexican places within walking distance, I didn't give this place much hope to begin with but I wa\", 'actual_label': 0, 'predicted_label': 0}, {'text': \"s in the mood for something quick and I can get in and out of most mexican places within 30 minutes.\\n\\nIt was quite empty when I walked in during my lunch hour.  There was only one other table occupied.  \\n\\nThe restaurant is nicely decorated with what appears to be hand painted murals on the walls.  The booth seats are a little low for me (I'm tall.  I don't like sitting on the ground).  The menu had an awful smell to it ..like they just wiped it off with water that was sitting around for a while.\\n\\nThey brought out 3 salsas and some queso with the chips.  The queso and the red salsa tasted like they were out of a can and were runny and had little flavor.  The green salsa was interesting with bits of avocado but it too was a bit runny.  The slaw salsa was the best and tasted fresh.\\n\\nOn with the meal.;  I ordered Lunch special #2 which is a taco / enchilada combo so i did the ground beef taco and chicken enchilada.\\n\\nLike most mexican places, it came out quickly.   Everything looked quite a\\nppetizing except for the frozen mixed vegetables that were mixed in with the rice.  But looks are deceiving.  \\n\\nThe taco was decent. - meat was flavorful and it was stuffed to the top.  The enchilada was runny.  How do you make a chicken enchilada runny?\\nThe beans were also runny and the rice had no flavor at all.  Everything was also quite salty.\\n\\nI have to say this was one of the worst Mexican places I've been to.\\nThings to go to Costco for:  \\n\\nGas:  It's usually at least 10 cents cheaper than anywhere else in town.  For me it's also on my way home from work making it super convenient!\\n\\nTheir Kirkland brand is probably the best store brand around.  It often gets better reviews on items than name brands.  Things to buy Kirkland include batteries, vitamins, laundry detergent, frozen lasagna, luggage and that's just naming a few.\\n\\nMy only complaint about Costco are the lines on weekends.  But that just forced me to go during the week when it is less crowded.\\nSuch a great experience with\\n some of my favorite Yelpers doing a UYE here (Unofficial Yelp Event).\\n\\nIt was an 8-course meal of bite size tastings from the regular menu.  The courses included a pimento cheese deviled egg, tempura fried turnips, a beet salad, a fried oyster over black eyed peas, duck breast and two wonderful chocolate desserts.\\n\\nEverything was delicious but the highlights for me were all the molecular gastronomy items that worked well with each meal especially the beet salad.  Also the 10 pepper hot sauce paired with the oyster that made me want to lick it off the plate.  And the chocolate desserts were just plain sinful.  \\n\\nThe interior of the restaurant is simple with a bar in the back room and old church pews for seating against the walls.  The rooms are separated by an open book shelf featuring Chef Paul's personal cookbooks.  \\n\\nI missed so many details in this review but the other 5 star reviews speak for wonders for this restaurant and the staff. It is definitely worth the trip down to Waxhaw\\n.  But keep in mind, this place is small.  Reservations are recommended on weekends.\\nI don't normally come down here on my lunch hour but was in the area and decided to stop at Stonecrest for something quick.  LOL.  Then I realized there are no quick options for lunch at Stonecrest.   The line at Wendy's was outside of the parking lot.  The line at Smashburger was to the door.  So I came here, knowing that they make things quickly and I can get everything to go and eat at my desk at the office.\\n\\nWell first thing is there was a line here as well.  And you had to wait to get to the counter to decide on your order because the menu options are not visible from the line that forms along the left side of the restaurant.  And I didn't see any printed menus to browse before I reached the counter.  I could have already decided if there was a menu on the wall or facing the front of the restaurant.\\n\\nThe ordering process is easy after you can see the menu options.  Similar to a Lennys.  They slice\\n the meat and cheese as you wait in line then your sandwich moves down the line for the toppings.  My hopes of getting out quick faded when the toppings guy decided to flirt with the two women behind me and as he was working on all sandwiches, mine got the least attention.\\n\\nYes, they use big (and i do mean big) slices of tomatoes, they stuff their sandwiches (unlike Jimmy Johns) but they could have stuffed mine a little faster.  Then I get to the register to checkout and there's no one there.  The guy is contantly checking on something in the back. \\n\\nBut as always, Jersey Mikes delivers on taste and the bang for the buck.  So For service, I give this experience a 2. For Taste, they get a 4.  Averages out to a 3 for this restaurant.\\nI haven't had the best of luck lately with Mexican places but I was craving it tonight and decided to try someplace new again and ended up here.\\n\\nEverything surprised me here.  With the chips and salsa, normally the red salsa is the spicy one.  At Paco's, th\", 'actual_label': 0, 'predicted_label': 0}, {'text': 'e tomatillo salsa is the spicier of the two.   The chips were kind of average though.  \\n\\nI had trouble deciding on a margarita so I went with the Firestarter which contains jalepeno-infused tequila and ginger beer.  That was actually the spiciest thing I had tonight which wasn\\'t a bad thing. It just caught me by surprise.  \\n\\nI ordered my meal (Paco\\'s Tacos) and I swear two minutes later it was sitting on my table.  What surprised me about this is the sweet sauce on the tacos which was a nice contrast to the spiciness of the salsa and the margarita.  It also came with Chacco beans, rice, and a slaw.   Considering I am not a big beans and rice person, the rice has to be good for me to finish all of it -- and it was.\\n\\nFor dessert I tried the Tres Leches cake which came out beautifully presentted and well it didn\\'t go away the beautifully but it was gone by the time I left.\\n\\nAll in All, Paco\\'s is a nice surprise.  Prices are decent, the service is excellent and the food is wonderful.  This\\n is definitely worth coming back to!\\nThis restaurant has been popular since appearing on the Food Network show, \"Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives\".  \\n\\nA couple of things to consider before heading here.  It sits outside of I-485.  The restaurant does not take reservations and if you are meeting a group there, your entire party must be there before being seated.  It\\'s not a big place so I understand why they do this.  Why have empty tables when there are other people waiting to be seated.\\n\\nThe restaurant itself is in an old gas station and has gas station memorabilia inside and outside of the restaurant.  \\n\\nThe staff was friendly here and will answer any questions you have on the menu.   The food is homey southern with an upscale twist.  I had the maple glazed pork chop which was sweet and savory.\\n\\nAnd for desert they had a blueberry cobbler which was one of the best I\\'ve had.  \\n\\nThis is definitely worth the trip outside the loop!\\nSo I am on vacation and my watch breaks.  I\\'m one of those p\\neople who feels naked without my watch.  I get to the Pittsburgh area and realize there\\'s a Target and a Kohl\\'s near where I am staying and I\\'m sure I can find a replacement.\\n\\nI check Kohl\\'s and not only do they have a watch I like but it\\'s the exact same one that I had broken.  Awesomeness!  Now I don\\'t have to shop for the whole wardrobe to match!  \\n\\nAnyway, this Kohl\\'s is like your standard one-story Kohl\\'s store - mens section on one side, women\\'s almost everywhere else.  With Kohl\\'s you can expect everything to be in the same place no matter if you\\'re in West Mifflin or West Miami.  \\n\\nThe girl at the checkout line was very pleasant also which is not something I often see at other Kohl\\'s.\\n\\nOverall great experience!\\nAfter my last visit to Duckworth\\'s I\\'ve decided they deserve an extra star just because of the extensive craft beer selection.  This time I did the smart thing and ordered a sampler which since the local breweries were not open today, I focused more on the local beers.  \\n\\n\\nThe favorite today was:  NoDaRyeZ\\'d™ ~ Double Rye India Pale Ale and I thank my server for recommending this.\\n\\nThe food was decent this time around.  I opted for a chicken breast club sandwich with fries.  Everything was good.  The fries were some of the best I\\'ve had in Charlotte.  \\n\\nThe thing that lacks here at Duckworth\\'s is the service.  They weren\\'t busy today but I rarely saw my server.  If they can improve on the service, I would probably bump this up to 5 stars.\\nWhen i first moved to Charlotte (many moons ago) and I was young (and poor) professional, I used to thing Harris Teeter was beyond my budget and opted for the quality of Bi-Lo.  Bi-Lo also reminded me of home, after all back then it was owned by the same company as Giant (PA), where I used to shop.\\n\\nUnfortunately, Bi-lo was sold off and the quality that I was used to went down hill.  However, this store is a decent store that is near work and that I stop by occasionally.  \\n\\nThe funny thing is it is neighbors with a Su\\nper Wally world but seems to do just fine on its own.  Apparently there are other people who don\\'t like Wally World either and appreciate the choice of another store nearby.  \\n\\nBi-lo\\'s prices are reasonable but they don\\'t have the selection that I am used to at Harris Teeter.  I\\'m often kicking myself for coming here becauuse I know I should have waited and hit HT on the way home.  \\n\\nBut I will give Bi-Lo this.  They sell and redeem lottery tickets which unless you want to use a machine, Harris Teeter doesn\\'t do.  I\\'ve claimed a $400 winner at this store.\\nI\\'ve been coming to Southview Dentistry for over 5 years now and it\\'s time for an update. First off, I have the mouth from hell so my teeth are nowhere near perfect but with the treatment and advice from my hygienist, Joanne, Dr. Kelly and the rest of the staff, I feel this is the best dentist practice I\\'ve ever been to. The mouth from hell has been tamed.\\n\\nWhat impressed me even more was a recent visit to get a new crown. I was told ', 'actual_label': 0, 'predicted_label': 0}, {'text': 'to expect a 2 1/2 hour appointment. Actually it was close to 3 1/2 because they were running late when I taken back. That should result in a 2 star review, right? Not here.\\n\\nPreviously you had to have 2 appointments...one to get your tooth prepped, drilled down and an impression taken and a temporary crown. They would then send the impression off to a lab to create your permanent crown and then you\\'d make a 2nd appointment to get your crown glued on. \\n\\nNot anymore! One long appointment is all it takes! \\n\\nNow, they prep your tooth and do a scan with this new computer they have. They have an image of your tooth and can plan your crown through this software program that you can watch. Dr. Kelly made sure it would fit my mouth and align with the rest of my teeth. Then she submitted the crown to be created...IN HOUSE! The machine is right in the office and you can hear and see it being created. Actually, do ask if you can watch it being created. It\\'s actually quite fascinating! After it is \\ncreated, it goes to the oven to bake for a while. What is put in your mouth is almost a perfect crown. They still have to do some minor adjustment but it is nearly perfect.\\n\\nThis and coupled with the fact that the novocaine didn\\'t make my entire face feel numb are two reasons I will keep coming back here. The staff here is friendly, they are completely honest with you and try to make your visit as painless as possible.\\nSomeone I know recommended this restaurant over another nearby Thai place.  This was my first visit to Bangkok Ocha and my first impression is that I\\'ll stick to the other place. \\n\\nThe staff was welcoming and friendly and indicated that their lunch menu changes daily.   I must have misread the menu item because I didn\\'t realize it was Fried rice with chicken and vegetables.  I could have done without the fried rice.\\n\\nAnyway, it came out and it was only lukewarm.  It was also mostly rice with a few pieces of chicken, carrots and green beans mixed in.   When I ordered a 4 \\non the heat meter, the waiter confirmed that it was \"Very spicy\".  Actually it came out about a 3 but you never know when you go to a new place.  \\n\\nI will say that the soup was good, it was hot and sour type soup with tomatoes. The meal also came with a spring roll in which I\\'ve had better.  \\n\\nMaybe it was what I ordered but my colleague that was with me wasn\\'t impressed with his meal either. \\n\\nIt was something worth trying but I think we\\'ll probably stick to the other place for lunch.\\nI used to love going to the old QS&L location when they had one at Park Rd Shopping Center so I was happy to find out that this restaurant was now open.\\n\\nThis restaurant is in the Centrum Shopping Center across from Home Depot in Pineville.  It\\'s in the former location of Joe\\'s Crab Shack and a steakhouse that didn\\'t last long there.\\n\\nThe inside of the restaurant is decorated with NASCAR and Harley Davidson memorabilia.  There are two cars attached to the ceiling...a light blue corvette and a NASCAR car \\nsigned by Jeff Burton.  There is also a motorcycle on the other side of the restaurant.   Also scattered across the restaurant are about 20 flat-screen TVs.  There are video games and other arcade games inside the front door in the waiting area.  \\n\\nThe seating in here is plastic resin chairs and typical square tables. The most comfortable seating appears to be a the bar.   The also have a large patio outside in which some seats are under a canopy and others are not.  \\n\\nThe menu consists of wings, sandwiches, salads, and more.  There are about 20 flavors of wings.  They have All you can eat Wing nights on Tuesdays and All you can Eat Boneless wing night on Wednesdays.\\n\\nI had two kinds of wings...the golden garlic and the Hot.  What I remember about their wings in the other locations is they were quite small but they must have changed something there because the wings were of decent size.  The sauces were good but not the best I\\'ve tasted. \\n\\nI looked over the beer list and their was noth\\ning that really stood out to me...Typical chain restaurant beer selection.  Not even a Yuengling which surprised me since I think this chain is based in PA, home of Yuengling.  \\n\\nService-wise, I was confused.  I had two people waiting on me and I wasn\\'t sure who was doing what.  And when the one person brought me a to go drink and asked me if I wanted my check.  Seemed a little flawed here and slow toward the end of my meal.  But otherwise, they were friendly.  \\n\\nIt might be a decent place for lunch once they get some of the service kinks fixed but I can\\'t see myself coming here for dinner when there are better locally-owned wing places around.\\nFinally got to try Futo Buta for lunch with a some friends as its been on my bucket list ever since a few of my Yelp friends checked the place out.\\n\\nThe restaurant is on the first floor of the Post apartment complex and faces the inbound lane of the Lynx blue line right at the the Bland Street station.  Three hour complementary parking is availa', 'actual_label': 0, 'predicted_label': 0}, {'text': \"ble at the bottom level of the apartment complex.\\n\\nThe restaurant is tiny so it might be best to come on off hours to get a seat.  There a long bar, a long pub table and a few regular tables inside and that's it.  They do have a large patio that may actually have more seating than inside the restaurant.  \\n\\nBefore you order from the menu, check out the fresh list on the wall in the main dining area for the daily specials. My friends ordered an appetizer off of that list that was absolutely amazing. I think it was tuna in a spicy sauce.\\n\\nMy order consisted of the fried brussels sprouts for an appetizer and the Fire and Ice entry.  The brussels sprouts were great but the tuna app was better!  Fire and Ice was just amazing. Ramen with smoked salmon and fresh veggies. It had a nice kick to it as well.\\n\\nFor dessert, they make their own ice cream and the flavor changes daily. Today's flavor was strawberry basil and it was quite tasty and very refreshing on a hot day.\\n\\nI think this will become\\n a regular lunch spot for me.\\nSince I pledged to support local for a whole month I took a detour from my usual stops at those chain bagel places to check out Owen's.\\n\\nOwen's sits inside the Pavillion which is across South Blvd from Atherton Mill.  It's a funly place with eclectic decor from sports pennants to chalkboard signs.  Their menu is quite extensive of breakfast and deli sandwiches and they feature Boar's Head deli meats.\\n\\nI ordered the Hangover Helper bagel sandwich which consisted of ham, egg and smoked gouda cheese.  Just the smell of the smoked gouda told me I was about to have a Foodgasm.  The bagel itself was soft, the ham was stuffed on it and the gouda...mmmmmmmmmm.  One of my favorite cheeses.  \\n\\nThe staff is very friendly here.  There's plenty of tables in the space and fountain drinks are help yourself.  \\n\\nYou definite get your money's worth here.\\nThis store is located in Park Road Shopping Center a few stores down from Harris Teeter.  It's an older store as you don'\\nt find too many of the big 3 drug stores that aren't in their own stand alone building these days but this store seems to do well right where it is.\\n\\nThe store is laid out like a typical chain drug store...drugs in the back just in front of the pharmacist.  Cold items on the right wall.  Photo center in the front right corner.\\n\\nEverything is A-ok until you get up to the front checkout.  The person working is usually slllllooooooowwwwww.   They are very inefficient.  When they could be taking your item, running it under the scanner and then bagging it...in my experiences they take the item, hold the scanner up to it, scan it, put it back on the counter, go through the other items, take your payment and then bag the items.  \\n\\nApparently getting people in and out in a timely manner is not a concern here.\\nThis was the latest stop for my dinner group. We were drawn to the place by the reviews on Yelp as well as the pictures. But unfortunately, things didn't turn out so well for our group.\\n\\n\\nI got there early and sat at the bar for a drink before the rest of the group. I enjoyed their mostly local beer tap selection and enjoyed talking with the bartender on beer.\\n\\nWhen the group was seated that's when things took a turn downhill. There was one server for the entire restaurant and it was quite busy. He tried to keep up but the service just suffered.\\n\\nWe started with appetizers. I ordered the chicken lettuce wraps. While they were good, I felt there was something missing like a sauce? \\n\\nFor an entree I ordered Grandma's Bibimbap which I heard was good here and I had never had Korean food (other than kimchi) before. While it came out presented well, my egg was over fried and not as pretty and the ones in the pictures on Yelp. The flavors were good but the chili paste which I thought was going to add some heat to the dish was quite disappointing. I didn't have the guts to ask for a bottle of siraccha. The kimchi that came with it was good as well as the pickled daikon but I re\\nally didn't care for the fish cake.\\n\\nThe good things about this restaurant are:\\n\\n1. Friendly staff\\n2. Fresh ingredients and they try to support local as much as possible.\\n3. Food and cocktail items are beautifully presented.\\n\\nThe bad things:  \\n\\n1. Service issues:  Drink orders were never placed, were extremely slow coming out and when they did come out, they were for wrong drink.\\n2. Didn't even ask if we wanted dessert, just brought the checks out. I ended up next door at Ben & Jerry's for my ice cream.\\n\\nI'd really like to try this place again. Perhaps, I will try their Thai options. I was eyeing my table mate's Fresh ginger meal which looked amazing.\\nWhen I was looking for a new mattress, I checked out all the big name players..the S words:  Simmons, Sealy and Serta I couldn't understand the costs for a one-sided mattress that you don't have the option to flip and that is only guaranteed for a few years.\\n\\nThen I checked out the Original Mattress Factory.  You've heard the commercials \", 'actual_label': 0, 'predicted_label': 0}, {'text': \"on TV...quality construction, made locally.  Yes, they do make their mattresses at this location.  They had just closed up the factory part for the day when I got there so I couldn't see them actually making mattresses but the salesman was happy to show me how the mattresses were made and the inside of their mattress compared to one of the bigger names.  \\n\\nCost-wise, they are considerably less then the big names.  The price includes boxspring and frame.  I desperately needed a new frame.  There's a small delivery charge included.  Compared to other furniture stores and delivery stores, I thought their delivery charge was very reasonable and they will even haul away your old mattress.\\n\\nAnd all their mattresses are still double sided so they will even send you emails on when it is time to flip your mattress.  Pretty cool, huh?\\n\\nWell my only complaint was it took me a while to get used to my new mattress and I had to put a memory foam topper on it but I'm still satisfied with my mattress \\nand will recommend OMF to anyone looking for a new mattress.\\nAfter so many rave reviews of this place, mine wit be a little more grounded. \\n\\nI stopped here for lunch to see what City Barbecue was all about. This is not a table service bbq joint. It's BBQ fast casual. You order at the counter, give them your name, go get your drink, silverware, condiments, etc, find a seat and they call your name. You clean up after yourself.\\n\\nI went with the Pick 2 option with brisket and pulled pork. I added a drink and a side of Mac n cheese. This came to $19.24. Ouch.\\n\\nThe waiting was minimal. Along with everything I ordered, they also gave me 3 side samples of corn casserole, green beans something I couldn't figure or what but it had rice on the bottom. \\n\\nFirst off, the side samples were all unappetizing and looked like they were either canned or cooked too long or both. The taste was kind of meh as well. This taste continued with the Mac n cheese. The meats were tender, especially the brisket whic\\nh is what they apperently shine with. The pork had no real flavor. \\n\\nI tried 4 of their sauces and all I would consider thick - gravy like thick. I think it was Burnside that I liked the best but I couldn't get over the sweetness and the thickness of all of them. \\n\\nI can't say I am a fan of this place. But then it's a chain, and not even based in the Carolinas. This is a chain based in Ohio. And that right there explains the blandness and the gravy like sauces. \\n\\nIf you want good bbq, there are plenty of locally owned places around worthy of your $$. Try Midwood Smokehouse, McCoys or Queen City Q. But come here if you want a step up from Other chains like Sonny's. I'm sure all of the above are cheaper as well. \\n\\nSo overall a 2 star place. The brisket was worth the 3rd star.\\nLet's start with the disclaimer....I am not normally a fan of chinese buffets.  Ok, now that we have that out of the way, I decided to give this a try because it outlasted the other buffet down the street and I was \\nin the neighborhood for lunch. \\n\\nThe building looks like an old cafeteria-style steakhouse.  The parking lot badly needs some maintenance. It's like pothole city out there!\\n\\nInside there are 8 different food bars...one with just seafood, one with fried options, 2 with more common chinese dishes, one with american food, one with soups, one with a salad bar, fruit and sushi and one with pastry-style desserts and ice cream.  \\n\\nI found the food here to actually be decent.  There wasn't much left on my 2 plates of regular food and my one plate of desserts.  The hot and sour soup is decent and definitely has a bit of spice to it.  The flavor on the orange chicken was really good.  The one spicy item they had on the bar - spicy chicken and shrimp really had some kick to it which is rare on a Chinese buffet.  I just wish there were more spice options.  \\n\\nThe pastry dessert bar was pretty good.  The cheesecake-like dessert was good.  The cakes were moist and had light flavors.  The chocolate ca\\nke didn't do much for me but I think it's because I saved it for last.\\n\\n$6.95 for a lunch buffet was a good price.  Add a drink in there and you still get out under $10.   \\n\\nThe only bad things I noticed is the grease on the salt and pepper shakers on the table which looked disgusting.  But who puts salt and pepper on chinese food anyway?\\nThis was my first visit to Lang Van and I can't believe I waited this long.  For the most part this was a wonderful experience.\\n\\nIt forced me out of my Vietnamese comfort zone and I broke away from the Pho for Vermicelli -  BUN GA NUONG to be exact.   The mixture of flavors in this dish gave my mouth an orgasm.  Mint mixed with chili pepper sauce.  I really wanted to order a 2nd dish to take home but this gives me reason to drive across town to come back.\\n\\nThe service was exceptional.  We never had to wait for drink refills.  Of course tea drinkers had their own pitchers on the table.  The food came out quick and was hot, very appetizing and very affo\", 'actual_label': 0, 'predicted_label': 27}, {'text': 'rdable for the portion you received.\\n\\nThe only bad thing was the booth we were seated in was a bit tight for 4 people and to me it was very uncomfortable.\\n\\nBut overall, this is another Charlotte gem!\\nIt always amazes me how much people rave about Olive Garden as the best Italian they\\'ve ever had.  These people really need to get out more because even compared with the other Italian chains, they are last on my list.  \\n\\nI don\\'t know how I ended up here today.  I guess my car made me come here due to the fact I couldn\\'t make up my mind where to go for lunch.\\n\\nI will give OG one thing....The Zuppa Tuscana is pretty darn good..good enough for 2-3 bowls.  The salad was awful..,,no wonder it was all you can eat.  Who wants to eat gobs and gobs of iceberg lettuce?\\n\\nThe server was really good but he wasn\\'t busy either.  He only had another table besides mine so it was like he was hawking over me which is just as bad as not being around at all.\\n\\nAnd then he gave me a water to go without asking. \\n I will say this...It\\'s the first place I\\'ve ever had a togo cup filled with water.\\nI am absolutely amazed with this practice.  Not only are they professional and friendly but they do awesome work.  I\\'ve had 5 dentists in my life and Dr. Kelly is the absolute best.\\n\\nAs for hygienists, Joann and Lisa are awesome too.  Joann tells you what she is doing every step of the way and is always concerned about your comfort.  She is absolutely the best hygienist I\\'ve had since I was a kid.\\n\\nAnd don\\'t forget Jen at the front desk.  She took the place of Marion who was awesome in her own way but Jen by far exceeds that...always willing to go beyond a normal receptionists duties. \\n\\nNow I am embarking on more major work for my mouth.  Dr. Kelly is taking pictures with a camera and impressions to make sure everything is perfect.  Never has any dentist of mine been so meticulous about my mouth.  \\n\\nAll this makes me wonder why I didn\\'t leave my old dentist sooner.   \\n\\nSeriously everyone, if you\\'re look\\ning for a great dentist, this is the place.\\nIt\\'s hard to believe I am giving a government building 5 stars but this was actually the best government related experience I\\'ve ever had.\\n\\nI was here for jury duty. My last experience with jury duty was at least 12 years ago and in the old building which was a completely different experience. \\n\\nThis new courthouse is beautiful. There is a large lobby on the first floor and a total of 8 floors. Jury gathering room is on the 5th floor.  The elevators are spacious. \\n\\nChecking into the jury holding room was a breeze and the staff was so friendly and helpful.  The room is a big change from the other building. There are 3 sections of the room with movie theatre style seating, a break room, a game room, a business center and a quiet room. The staff pointed out that many of these amenities were paid by grants and not tax dollars\\n\\nThey show movies here, they have free Wifi and have free popcorn in the afternoon. \\n\\nIf you get called for a jury, the se\\nlection process can be long and tiresome. That was my biggest complaint.  My 2nd biggest complaint were the chair for jurors in the courtroom were uncomfortable for a tall person. I felt like I was sitting on the floor and the back of the chair leaned back quite far and squeaked.  \\n\\nThe bailiffs were great. Both I dealt with had a great sense of humor and the people on the jury I served on were also a pleasure to be around.\\n\\nAfter the trial, the judge came in to talk to the jury about the process. \\n\\nI actually enjoyed serving on this jury and doing my duty as a citizen and enjoyed this whole experience!\\nBecause of all the road construction on Independence Blvd the Bo\\'s at Idlewild road was forced to close. But Bo\\'s built this new restaurant just down the road.\\n\\nIt\\'s a typical Bo\\'s. Walk in place your order, move down the line to get your order and drinks. The dining room is your average size Bo\\'s. Nothing that really stands out here.\\n\\nThe food is fresh and always consistent which is wh\\nat counts. And Bo\\'s makes the best biscuit sandwiches that tops the rest of the fast food joints.  \\n\\nCustomer service is ok definitely not the best, but not the worst either.\\nWhen I just getting started with my Wii, I used to come here for the used games.  They don\\'t give you much for trading in a game but it\\'s better than nothing and they also have a decent selection of new and used games.\\n\\nFor the most part, the staff is helpful but usually I know what I want and get in and out within 15 minutes.\\nI really want to give Sullivan\\'s 4 stars but in comparing this experience to a recent visit to Longhorn, I just can\\'t bring myself to do it.\\n\\nWent here with a group from work for an \"appreciation dinner\"  Normally, Appreciation dinners end up at Chili\\'s or Ruby Tuesday so I was completely shocked we ended up here.\\n\\nEverything was great service wise.  Foodwise, it was good but I\\'d expect that from a place like this.  I ordered one of their Mixup lunches which gives you a salad option, a prote', 'actual_label': 0, 'predicted_label': 0}, {'text': 'in and a side.  I ordered the mixed green salad, the porcini mushroom and pepper encrusted strip and an order of carmelized cauliflower as a side.\\n\\nThe strip was amazing.  It came sliced over a layer of steak sauce.  It was cooked perfectly.  The salad was ok....mixed greens with tomatoes, blue cheese and a dressing that I still do not recognize.  The cauliflower came in a mound.  Honestly, this had to be 1/2 to 2/3 of the head of cauliflower.  It was seasoned with capers and other herbs.  While the taste was good, the quantity was entirely too much and I could only eat half.\\n\\nThe decor of the place is as you would expect with a lot of medium to dark wood but it just didn\\'t do anything for me.  Same with the service. While they were all friendly, our water just didn\\'t go beyond what he was expect to do.   \\n\\nSorry, Sullivans but I can get better service at Longhorn and frankly I think their food is better also.   But still this is a solid or 3 1/2 star review.\\nOn this visit, I\\'m rating \\nLiberty on a completely different experience than my last review.\\n\\nThis visit I was alone and sat myself at the bar.  The bar was quite dark and I had some difficulty reading the menu and the beer list.  But the bartender was happy to explain anything to me.\\n\\nFor a beer, I got the last few drops of one of Triple C\\'s brews so I felt special there. Little did I know how much this taste of Triple C would have me become a regular at their brewery.  Not a bad thing, actually.\\n\\nThe beer selection is very diverse.  You\\'ll only find craft brews on tap here.  They may have other things in bottles but I was only concerned with draft.  The bartender was super helpful in helping me decide on my next beer.\\n\\nFor dinner, I could not decide.  The problem with the menu is they have a lot of unique selections but none that really popped to me as something to try.  It was more of what do I settle for.  So this time around I went with the burger which was voted Best in Charlotte one year.  And it was good\\n.  Very juice at medium.  The fries were good but a little salty.\\n\\nBecause of the menu issue, I can\\'t see myself being a regular here but I could see coming here for the beer when the local breweries are closed (typically, Monday).  \\n\\nRating breakdown:\\n\\nFood:  3\\nAtmosphere:  3\\nService:   5\\nBeer selection:    4\\n\\nAverage:  4.\\nThis Shell is located on King\\'s Drive near Morehead Street right next to the Kings Dr Farmers Market.  There are 8 pumps in front of the store.  On the left side of the parking lot is an automatic ice machine and a vacuum.  Just outside the front door is another Ice machine, where you can pick up bags of ice paid for in the store.\\n\\nInside the store, they have the standard convenience items,....coffee, microwavable foods, a wall of refrigerated drinks and BEER.  \\n\\nThis store also sells lottery tickets which is what I usually go in for.   The staff is usually very friendly here and almost always wishes you luck on the lottery.\\nI\\'ve been in this store once before but I\\n never really took a look around until a recent visit. This is a small Harris Teeter in a small shopping center. \\n\\nThe store is laid out really well with a decent size produce section dairy along the back wall and a small wine and beer selection in the front right corner. Aisles may seem a little narrow here but it is a smaller store and it\\'s not as busy as the two other stores on Park Rd.  \\n\\nThe staff I dealt with on my latest visit were really friendly and helpful. You don\\'t get that at some of the other stores anymore. There are no self-checkouts here either so eventually you have to deal with one of their friendly employees. \\n\\nI actually think I may come here more often than the store at Park Rd Shopping Center. It seems easier to find things here.\\nI\\'ve always been a fan of Lowe\\'s but this store in my \"hood\" is probably my favorite.  First off the store is a cool urban design rather than the sprawling store layout you see in the burbs.  It was built to blend in to the established n\\neighborhood.  \\n\\nThere\\'s extra parking on the roof but I\\'ve never been up there.  \\n\\nThe store is pretty much laid out like any other Lowes and like most stores the staff is friendly and willing to help.\\n\\nI personally love the garden center here and it\\'s my 2nd choice of stores to go to after Blackhawk Hardware.  I try to support the locals first and then head to Lowes since they are based up the road in Mooresville.  I try to avoid the orange place at all costs and I can usually find what i\\'m looking for a Lowes anyway.,\\nAs much as I try to avoid fast food, sometimes I get in the mood for McDonalds.  Their fries just go really well with ketchup and most of their burgers don\\'t have mayo on them so I don\\'t have to ask them to hold it.  The burgers come with a great mixture of mustard and ketchup and the cheese is gooey to blend with everything else in the burger.  \\n\\nThis McDonald\\'s is consistently good.

It's easy in and out since there's a traffic light right there.  \\n\\nDefinitely one of the better McD's in the area.\\nI've been to this Firebird's a few times but this review is based on my most recent visit on May 11, 2010 for lunch.\\n\\nThere were 8 of us for a business lunch.  4 of us are larger than normal men.  We were placed at one of the round tables that may have fit 8 smaller people comfortably but we were all uncomfortable at this table as there was no room to move once we were seated.\\n\\nThe should say something when they give your drink orders that it's going to be a while until you see a refill.  Eventually everyone received a refill except for me.   What's so hard about refilling unsweetened iced tea?  \\n\\nOn the meal, i as\\nked for a side green salad without the pecans that came with it.  I watched the server write this down so something got screwed between typing it into the ordering system and the preparer because the salad came out with pecans on it.  I'm allergic to pecans but I picked them out anyway the best i could.  I should have sent it back.\\n\\nAt this point I'm still waiting for a refill on my tea as the rest of my table gets refills on their drinks.  \\n\\nFinally the meal comes out and I am able to snag another server to refill my tea.  \\n\\nI ordered a pasta dish.  Well the penne pasta was undercooked.  At this point I feel I'm a customer at Hell's Kitchen.  So I drink my tea.  Wrong move.  \\n\\nThe server came around to check refills on drinks and was noting everyone.. Twice I had to tell her to refill mine as she missed it the first time she marked it down on her mental list.\\n\\nFinally a refill.  But it was gone in no time.  Do I dare ask for another one?\\n\\nWell I wasn't paying for this meal but I were,\\n I wouldn't have tipped well and it only instance of bad service for me to stay away.  This may be it for me.\\nThis is a really nice old theatre in one of Charlotte older neighborhoods. They do plays and musicals here and allow community organizations to use the space for their events.\\n\\nSeating in the house is a bit uncomfortable if you are a tall person like myself so I usually end up sitting in the very back against the wall or in the front row and those aren't what I would consider good seats.\\n\\nStill I appreciate this theatre for still being in Charlotte since Charlotte has a tendency to tear down it's history.\\nThis is the first SuperTarget that I have ever been in. I cannot say I really liked it either.  I needed two items from the regular part of the store and wouldn't you know it I went it the wrong entrance. I went in the entrance for the grocery section and of course my items were at the opposite end of the store. Figures.\\n\\nAnyway, thankfully both were in the front of the store \\nso that made it a bit easier.  \\n\\nStill I could see myself getting lost here as things are not laid out like a normal Target store and for me, that's all I need. Sorry, Target. I love your smaller stores but this is too darn huge for me. I doubt I will here much.\\nI love Salud, the bottle shop below that originated the name but Salud has now taken over the space above it as their own brewery and it is amazing!\\n\\nNot only do they have their own creative beers - think Saison, sours and IPAs but they also have an amazing space up here with a nice size bar, comfortable seating, a stage, a gallery wall and a shuffleboard table. \\n\\nThe bar serves coffee during the day and beer and wine at night. \\n\\nWhat more could you want? They can also hook you up with food from Fud at Salud on the floor below. \\n\\nYou should also note that you cannot take beer from the bottle shop upstairs or vice versa. Nor does your tab transfer. T\\n\\nIt's a great space. I honestly can't decide if I like this place better or Sal\\nud the Bottle shop below here better but I am confident they will both be successful!\\nI had planned on hitting another Thai place today for lunch but due to traffic on Arrowood Rd we went right instead of fighting traffic and decided to give Siam Garden another try.\\n\\nUnfortunately, all the reasons why I had stayed away became evident once again when we entered.\\n\\nThere wasn't a clean table in the place so we were forced to wait until one was cleaned off.   Then we waited 10 minutes for menus and utensils.  We ordered.  I ordered no rice but my dish came with it anyway.  \\n\\nThe food was ok this time.  The vegetables were barely cooked and a slice of carrot was actually raw.  The dish didn't even look appetizing.\\n\\nI don't know what to say about the service.  When I said thank you after they filled up my water glass, all I heard was a grunt.  Yes, a grunt.

I heard one estimate of 25,000 but I don\\'t know about that one.  But it\\'s possible.\\n\\nAnyway, I way thoroughly impressed and proud to know that I helped plant this seed back in 2001.  \\n\\nThank you to the organizers and friends who kept this going.  It\\'s nice to see Charlotte evolving where LGBT people are being accepted more and more.\\nI\\'ve had Crunch\\'s wraps at a Yelp event last year but figured I needed to exper\\nience them on my own to give my own review.\\n\\nThis store is actually a stand at one end of the food court in South Park mall.  The menu is easy to read for people like me who often forget their glasses.  There are several salad options and wrap options and the opportunity to create your own.  \\n\\nOrdering is at one end and then you pay for your order at the other end.  You can pick up your drink in the refrigerated case along the way. \\n\\nI ordered the greek isles salad and added salmon to it.  I have to say, this is one of the best salads I\\'ve had in a while and definitely the best salad I\\'ve ever had from a mall food court.  The only flaw is with the choice of lettuce.  This salad comes with iceberg lettuce which really has little nutritional value.  But oh well, the flavors of cukes, tomatoes, onions and dressing were great., maybe a little heavy on the dressing but it was still good.  The salmon was cooked perfectly as well and was a nice healthy addition to my salad.  It was $4 extra w\\nhich Ior the size of it, I thought it was quite reasonable.\\n\\nPrice was, it was decent...Salad, salmon addition and designer water for $14.\\nI stopped here on a stormy Tuesday thinking it might be less busy and I could easily find a parking space.  Wrong....apparently the place still has the newness factor and I drove around 10 minutes trying to find a parking space   I tried the valet parking across the street but they were full and I ended up driving around before settling on a space 3 blocks away.\\n\\nThankfully there were a couple of seats at the bar which I claimed one.  Looking around the place, I felt really old here. The place seems to cater to the younger crowd even at 8pm.  \\n\\nThe bar was busy. It was about 10 minutes before someone even acknowledged me.  Then I asked what their beers were and she explained them (little did I know that the menu she would hand me in a few minutes would contain a list of their beers).  Thankfully they have a bunch of craft beers on tap.  \\n\\nThe food m\\nenu is small and consists of apps (think chips with salsa, queso or guac), salads, tacos and such but your choices are limited for all of them.\\n\\nI went with the recommendation from another review of the queso with everything except chorizo for an app and 2 tacos rojas which were all vegetarian.  Another disappointment when both arrived at the same time.  The queso was mediocre at best.  It was very grainy and the extras of black beans and jalapenos were on top of a cheese crust rather than mixed in the queso.\\n\\nThe tacos were decent but nothing i would consider better than average.\\n\\nService is what caused this to be a 2 star review rather than a 3. Although there were 3 bartenders, only one seemed to be \\'my\\' bartender but she disappeared and I didn\\'t see her after one \"Are you ok here\".   Another bartender asked me if I wanted another beer but that was it...at that point I was ready to close my bill.  The 3rd one asked again if I needed another beer and I stated I was done and finally I', 'actual_label': 0, 'predicted_label': 0}, {'text': 'ften turn out better on the menu than on the plate. It\\'s not that they are bad, it\\'s just that they aren\\'t particularly memorable.\\n\\nAlso, certain \"standard\" (Americanized?) dishes seem to be a bit more lacking than the more \"authentic\" options, so if you are feeling adventurous, take that route instead. For instance, the barbacoa seems to generally turn out well.\\n\\nAs has been noted, the parking is iffy - so if you go at a busy time, you might find yourself looking around a bit in order to find a spot. At other times, it\\'s a ghost town, so that\\'s not an issue. If you can make it at an off time, then you might enjoy things a bit better, because you don\\'t have to worry about parking and service will be a bit better to boot.\\nHeard they had Armenian food here, and figured I hadn\\'t had Armenian food lately (perhaps ever), so what the heck. As an aside, the food in this strip mall is top notch, with Poppyseed\\'s, Bisonte, and now Ararat, but I digress.\\n\\nSo what is Armenian food? Where the heck\\n is Armenia? As it turns out, Armenia is near the middle east. So it is perhaps no surprise you\\'e talking Persian food. It\\'s kababs (however you choose to spell them), shwarma, hummus and the like. They do turn things up a notch, and are a bit fancier than, say, Kabab Je, but don\\'t mind if you arrive in casual clothes.\\n\\nOne item on the menu that we tried that I haven\\'t seen elsewhere is the pomegranate wine. Definitely different, and worth a taste.\\n\\nAs to the food - very tasty. They have things other than your standard Persian fare if you don\\'t feel like it, so branch out a bit if you like. The staff will help some with the menu (but mostly just suggests a few things that you can probably read yourself). All in all a worthwhile trip to the outskirts of Matthews.\\nIf you\\'re craving a little Thai in the area, then this is certainly a good option. The actual entrance can be a small challenge, since they\\'re on the bottom floor - but keep at it and you can find it without too much trouble.\\n\\n\\nOn the inside, it\\'s like entering another world, which is like taking a nice break from the outside. Definitely worthwhile. At lunch, they have some menu options that come out insanely fast - like you get done ordering and they are at your table. Not sure if they do the same for dinner/off the specials list, but man, that is crazy quick.\\n\\nThe spice isn\\'t as hot as some other places, but you can adjust it, or once you\\'re used to their level, just go up as needed.\\n\\nOne downside is that parking lot. I have no idea why Walgreens needs so many spaces, but that can make it a challenge to find a place to pull in, and that can be frustrating at lunch when you\\'re in a hurry.\\nThe location of the Comedy Zone isn\\'t bad at all - though you\\'re in the basement, it gives it a sort of underground feeling. Well, it is underground, but underground as in hip, not underground as in below ground. Also, the ceiling isn\\'t high, but it isn\\'t low enough to make you feel especially closed in either, so that work\\ns.\\n\\nWhat doesn\\'t work has already been mentioned - you\\'ve paid for tickets (generally - you can find some decent free or nearly free shows if you look hard enough), and then you also have to pay for drinks, even for water (bottled only, no tap), and then you are expected to tip for said water. I don\\'t mind adding a tip for good service. But if you want the money, ask for it up front rather than nickel-and-diming me for it. If the employees aren\\'t getting it, pay them out of that ticket price.\\n\\nFood is reasonable, but don\\'t go expecting anything outstanding - you are effectively in a bar, so go in with that expectation and you\\'ll be fine.\\n\\nAs to seats, some are better than others. If you can get closer to the stage, the seats will be better. If you are seated along the back wall, it\\'s not so great - people seated up front will walk in front of you, servers will walk in front of you, people at your table will walk in front of you (get the idea).\\n\\nThe shows? Generally pretty darn good - j\\nust keep all of the above in mind and it\\'ll be good. The location is probably better than any of the prior ones, so hopefully they\\'ll stay here for a while rather than moving again.\\nWith the summer heat upon us, now is a great time to find the King of Pops cart. They have all sorts of popsicles, but not the standard variety that you might be used to as kids - instead you get things like grapefruit, cinnamon, fig and jalapeno. These are definitely not your mama\\'s pops, but don\\'t let that deter you.\\n\\nThe most difficult part other than finding them (look on their web site for upcoming locations) is deciding on what you want to order, because just about everything is tasty. The good news is that there are plenty, so don\\'t hold back - get one of each, or catch them the next day and get more. You might need a second job though, because these babies are addictive.\\nThough there is still work to do, I have to give this location of Compare Foods a thumbs up.  They have an insane produce departme', 'actual_label': 1, 'predicted_label': 1}, {'text': 'nt.  Walter would be proud.  Heck, just about anyone would be proud.  Often there seems to be a whole truckload of day-workers in there, trimming new arrivals, cleaning bins, getting the section ready for (more) business.  Even better is that most speak solid English, and as far as I can tell, at least one other language.  They could be messing with me though, so I really cannot vouch for their ability to speak anything else.\\n\\nThe rest of the store is huge, especially for an international-style market, and very well stocked.  You can get almost anything.  Even on the way in, you will find jewelery (unlike some, there is actually merchandise in the case), audio equipment, and most any sort of cooking equipment or utensil you might need.  It is just about like an indoor flea market.\\n\\nAside from the produce section, one of the coolest features has to be the meat counter.  It is like an old-school butcher back there - the only difference being that you will find lots of flap meat (which is\\n not, contrary to popular belief, anything like a back room in an adult bookstore) and plenty of marinated options.  Awesome.\\nThe location of this, uh, location? Stellar. It\\'s prominently featured right on Main Street. Which is to say, Trade Street, since Matthews doesn\\'t actually have a Main Street in the middle of town. It\\'s also at the front of Matthews Station. That means just about whichever way you are headed, you can enjoy whatever they offer - unless you are stuck at the train (do trains still go through Matthews? I assume so - in that case, you might be on the wrong side, and then you\\'re out of luck).\\n\\nAssuming you do make it in, then it\\'s a nice building, and the roll-up/slide-up/whatever doors are also nice, if the weather should cooperate. And if it doesn\\'t, then they can stay down, providing a bit of shelter. The staff, though they are mostly what you would find at other fast food joints, are generally friendly as well.\\n\\nUnfortunately where the wheels start to fall off is \\nthat the food just isn\\'t that great. It isn\\'t that it\\'s bad, exactly, but if you\\'ve had some real BBQ, or even Midwood or Queen City Q (which isn\\'t to say they are bad, but they are a bit more sanitized than a few others), then this is milder still. Put simply, there are better options out there, especially when one of their advertised methods of serving (\"Bama Style\" I think?) is to drown the meat in sauce. That is probably a sign to run the other way.\\nI think they keep making up words for doctors.  Who ever heard of an \"endodontist\" when they were growing up?  You just had a \"doctor\" and a \"dentist\"?  But I digress.\\n\\nWhen one of our sons needed to have a root canal, they sent us to the endodontist, and while I have no idea if there are many of them in the area, this is where we ended up.  (We have since found out that there is at least one other, since we have now been there too!)\\n\\nThe office is pretty nice - I would imagine it\\'s because of the prices.  Root canals aren\\'t cheap.  The\\n good thing is that rather than being in some dungeon while they dig at your teeth they let you look out a nice big window into the parking lot.  Unfortunately that means that people could look at you too - might be nice if they changed that.\\n\\nAnyway, the staff was very nice, and they took care of things very quickly, it all seems to be doing very well.  I just hope we don\\'t have to see them again soon!\\nExcellent gas station, with plenty of pumps, many of which are frequently open, and perhaps most importantly, they often have some of the best prices around, which makes it even better. The only bad thing is the parking lot of this place. What is it with lots in the greater Charlotte area that makes it so difficult?\\n\\nIt seems like there are a dozen entrances/exits into this lot, and signage is horrible, so make sure you pay close attention, or someone intent on getting their McRib is going to plow into you. The best thing to do is likely to stop for a lunch special somewhere, then on yo\\nur way out, fill up for gas - also a good idea because the pumps here can run slow at times.\\nI really like the idea of the Block & Grinder, but I really dislike the execution.\\n\\nFor starters, getting into the location stinks. This isn\\'t just their fault - there are plenty of other places in the same shops that have the same problem - about the only way that is easy is if you\\'re headed uptown on Providence, and I\\'m never headed that way unless I think of it in advance, which I never do.\\n\\nBeyond that, the hours never work for me. I tend to think of it as an afterthought, and though I don\\'t often get out late, for whatever reason I tend to get by Block & Grinder late - so I find it odd when we pop in at 9:30 or so and are told that they are closing.\\n\\nThis is the perfect place to kick back, have a cocktail and enjoy some bites that you can\\'t find much of anywhere else in town, but... YOU CAN\\'T BECAUSE THEY ARE CLOSING HALF AN HOUR EARLIER THAN THEIR HOURS SAY THEY WILL.\\n\\nI get that they don', 'actual_label': 1, 'predicted_label': 1}, {'text': '\\'t want to start something late, and that\\'s fine - but at least a cheese plate or something would have been nice, and keeping the amazing bar area open would be even better. Oh well.\\n\\nIf you should happen to get there at a better time, then the food is more interesting than just about anywhere in town, and the cocktails are totally worthwhile. Try the chupacabra if you can get it.\\nAh, the courthouse.  It evokes so many emotions.\\n\\nIf you are headed there to deal with a ticket of some kind, you are undoubtedly filled with dread.\\n\\nIf you are only going for jury duty - er, service - you are, well, also filled with dread.\\n\\nI would also imagine if you have to work there that you probably also have some amount of dread.\\n\\nSo perhaps this magnificent edifice to justice is simply a reflection of that one emotion, which one day will remind us of Sylvester Stallone and Armand Assante (or even Rob Schneider) in the send-up of the much-better-than-that UK comic Judge Dredd.\\n\\nUntil then, you get noth\\ning.  Except for a monstrous wait.\\n\\nIf you go to deal with the aforementioned ticket, you will wait.  If you are lucky and don\\'t have to actually go into the courtroom, you wait until the doors open, your ticket is signed off, and you either go or pay a fine and leave.  If not, you wait until they call your name, see a DA and then pay the fine and leave (or perhaps fight the ticket and then, if you are lucky, leave).\\n\\nIf you are summoned for your jury service, you will wait even longer - perhaps as long as a full day, but at least you get wifi, a few computers you can use if you don\\'t bring your own, vending machines and a couple of movies to watch if you aren\\'t summoned to watch people wondering what will become of them if they lose their fight against the justice system.\\n\\nIf you are there for criminal reasons, then you may never leave.  Tom Petty, eat your heart out.\\n\\nAnd if you happen to work in said system?  As MercyMe puts it, \"I Can Only Imagine\", but I really don\\'t want to.  I j\\nust want to run the other way.  The building isn\\'t nearly as bad as the old one, but I really want to be somewhere else.  Anywhere else.  Please?\\nHoly cow.  I have never reviewed this Home Depot?  I think I go here at least once a week.  I guess I figured that at some point in the last six years I must have put in a review at some point.  Now I need to check all the other Home Depots too.  Dang.\\n\\nWhatever the case, even though this is my \"home\" Home Depot - probably being the closest to my house - it may just be my least favorite.  I\\'m not sure why.  While most of your Home Depot locations look about the same, this one just seems a bit under the weather.  The staff is usually a bit less friendly and like some other stores, they don\\'t generally know much about what is going on, or at least that is the impression since they don\\'t seem to want to talk to you.\\n\\nFor instance, we wanted to buy a shed (one of those you put in your yard) and we actually had really good service from this guy wh\\no came out and answered a ton of questions.  Then he sent us inside to actually purchase the shed, and told them that he had given us a bunch of information.  No one inside even knew who the guy was.\\n\\nDo people stand in the parking lot trying to sell sheds for them?  I don\\'t know.  So if you know what you want, you are probably set.  Otherwise, you might want to try another location (we went to Matthews instead).\\n\\nAlso be aware of the fact that they almost always have only self-serve checkout aisles running, so if you don\\'t like them, run!\\nHow you like this cafe will completely depend on why you are there. Want to sit and hang out, and have some tea? Then chances are you will probably enjoy. They have a variety, as the name would certainly suggest - in fact, it\\'s a decent sized menu based on the tea alone.\\n\\nBut they do in fact have a few food offerings, and featured right there over the counter you can see that they have banh mi (a little off to the side you can see some appetizer-like\\n offerings too).\\n\\nNow there are a few places in town to get banh mi, incuding one not a couple hundred feet away, another down Tryon, and a variety of others, and I would have to say that if this is the reason you are here, you should probably stick to the tea. Perhaps add a side of popcorn chicken, because that is downright tasty. If KFC gets a hold of this recipe, it might bring the colonel back to life, and not just the variety that you\\'ll see in those strange spots on the tube right now - the real deal colonel.\\n\\nIt\\'s also certainly not that the staff isn\\'t helpful. They are friendly and the drink-sealing machine (even for water!) is pretty cool. You might want to go just to check that out. But the banh mi can be had better at other places, so keep that in mind.\\nThe problem with the Charlotte area as a whole is that there is not a lot of variety when it comes to eating out. Sure, if you just moved here, you will have some options. But if you\\'ve lived here for any length of time, you', 'actual_label': 1, 'predicted_label': 1}, {'text': \" will inevitably start recalling what the place used to be previously, maybe even a time or two before then.\\n\\nOn the good side, I have no idea what this used to be, because I believe that the center is relatively new, and thus has had no prior tenants. That is a good thing. On the bad, it's a bit out of our normal area of travel, but we were there, so decided to stop. Also, as has been previously mentioned, the service was on the slow side.\\n\\nWhen it comes to the food, however, it was a solid meal for a perfectly reasonable price and the staff was friendly in the process. But since they are out of the way, we may not make our way there in the future.\\nWe first went to Chuy's not long after they opened, and perhaps for that reason, were not impressed. It took a while to go back, and it turns out, we just don't seem to be fans of the place.\\n\\nThere is a bit of kitschy appeal to the place, the food definitely takes a backseat to the overall decor. They've done a nice job of revamping the joi\\nnt so that it looks nothing like Zink - though Zink was actually a pretty decent place (especially that patio!) before.\\n\\nOn the inside, you have trees, and noise and kids and, like others have side, IT IS LOUD. Maybe I'm showing my age more and more, but I could do without all the extra props and noise - I'd much rather have better food instead. What is there is okay, but when you throw everything else into the mix, it's just not worth it.\\nThe Hickory Tavern is a perfectly reasonable fast casual-type place, though since it has been growing for a while now, it is rapidly approaching a status of something more than just a neighborhood bar. It is certainly better than the fully generic Applebees, to be sure, but only just barely.\\n\\nWhile the food isn't impressive enough to stand out or be memorable in any sort of way, the staff is definitely friendly, which is a good thing, because without them there wouldn't be much of a reason to return in any sort of a hurry.\\n\\nWhere the problem really l\\nies is in the marketing, and this isn't entirely the fault of Hickory Tavern - they do advertise themselves as a sports bar. The problem is that they seem to try and pick up on the same fast casual crowd that you will find at an Applebees or somewhere. The issue with that is you end up not with a sports bar crowd, but with families toting youngsters in strollers to sports bars, and that is just strange.\\nAh... the pizza buffet.  Is there a more noble goal on earth, especially for families with young 'uns?  Well, you could hope for a pizza buffet with good pizza, perhaps, but other than that, I mean.\\n\\nWe actually stopped here because we were in the area due to another engagement, and trying to feed a gaggle of kids isn't easy.  Lots of (relatively) cheap pizza is a good idea.  Unfortunately, finding the place isn't simple.  It's tucked around the back of one side of the strip mall, and this center is both packed and cursed with a nasty parking lot (and we were unable to find Cici's on th\\ne sign out front).  We had to call to figure out where they were located.\\n\\nOnce inside, we found that while most locations in Charlotte are generally fairly unimpressed with Cici's, Gastonians love Cici's.  They were packed.  As in line out the door packed.  And the buffet was generally kept barely stocked.  Once in the door  you had to scope out a potential table (not easy with a party of 10) and once seated you had to watch for pizza being put on the buffet and make a run for it.\\n\\nStill, it's a nice option if you have a lot of kids to feed.\\nIt's not uncommon to find a Chinese restaurant in a strip mall (at least, not in Charlotte), but it is reasonably uncommon to find a decent Chinese restaurant in a strip mall.  This particular restaurant has been in this location next to the Food Lion for quite a while, for good reason - it typically has a solid flow of traffic moving in and out through the doors.\\n\\nThe menu selection isn't anything different from any other menu that you'll find at\\n any other Chinese restaurant, but one notable difference about this place is that if you call them you can actually understand them.  This isn't a slight on Chinese people, but sometimes it seems that if you try and place an order it's like using a really bad drive-through speaker.  Not here.  That alone is worth at least one star.\\n\\nWhen it comes to the food, it's prepared quick and with fresh and tasty ingredients, at a decent price.  While there is a small selection of combinations, most of the selection is made up of plates where you can order either a small or large size.  Beware - the large size is big.  Two people can eat off of it and have some left!\\nTucked in next to Customshop (for the time being) is Elizabeth Creamery, a mom & pop ice cream shop, owned by the same folks who started the Carolina Creamery in Mint Hill many years ago (they don't own Carolina Creamery any longer).\\n\\nDepending on when you stop in, the place is either packed, or standing almost empty. And because i\", 'actual_label': 1, 'predicted_label': 1}, {'text': \"t's a mom & pop place, you may not find every flavor you want - for instance, the beer ice cream may not be in stock. Just look at the cartons and see which are covered by lids. If they are covered, check something else, you are likely to find one that is a worthy replacement (try the red bean!).\\n\\nOn the downside, they have just closed temporarily while they relocate around the corner, and are scheduled to reopen in February 2014. Get those tongues (or spoons, if this is your preference) ready!\\nThough there is now a fancy new JJ's (okay, not fancy by most people's reckoning, but fancy perhaps compared to the original), the East Boulevard location is still the best. I just wish it were closer. Of course, then I would be spending way too much time there, so it's probably for the best that it's just where it is.\\n\\nYou can find a most excellent selection of dogs on the menu, but even after all these visits, my favorite is still the Char-Heel. Nothing quite like a charred dog. Though you can\\n of course eat a boiled dog - and you can probably eat one without even boiling it, truth be known - there isn't one quite like a dog without a good char on it. And while most of JJ's dogs have a good char, the combination of ingredients on the Char-Heel just seem to come out the best.\\n\\nThere are a decent selection of toppings on the others, but they don't hit the spot quite the same. While I like the sides, they almost always end up a little limp for my taste. A good example is that batch of onion rings (straws?). The first one or two is great. But after a few minutes, it turns into a sloppy mess, and it's really hard to get to the bottom, but throw just a couple on top of the Char-Heel and you're set.\\n\\nAnother great thing about JJ's is that pickle bar. And also don't forget to use your Yelp app - you can typically get something for free (sometimes more than one thing), just for firing it up.\\nThis location has never been particularly friendly to restaurants - from the original steakho\\nuse (Quincy's, maybe?) to the Jamaican place that replaced it (Pop-a-Top?) to the first Chinese buffet that replaced it, to what was perhaps the longest running business, The Green Tomato Buffet, none seem to have fared all that well. Maybe the problem is that they have all had a buffet of sorts. Regardless, someone else has decided to give it a go, and this time they at least may have a bit of experience.\\n\\nI say may because I really don't know for sure, but there is an Ichiban over near the airport, and certain aspects of this location remind me of that one - some fresher ingredients on the hibachi, including the ability to get an egg mixed in, some more creative sushi rolls, even frog legs on the buffet. No guarantees, but it's possible.\\n\\nAs to the food, for the most part it's a buffet. Generally the food is less fresh than you will get than if you order off of a menu, but for a buffet, it's pretty decent - especially the sushi and hibachi options. Buffet food is generally about aver\\nage. I can say that I ate it and I didn't die, so that's a win.\\nI don't know that I would say that they are an especially bad Food Lion - but if you compare them to a Harris Teeter or Lowe's, they will probably come out looking a bit worse, as Food Lion is definitely not fancy compared to those.  They probably will not be overpriced compared to them, however.\\n\\nI've always found the staff at this location to be friendly, though I would definitely keep an eye on the meat.  In fact, I would probably do that at just about any Food Lion.  I don't think they are intentionally doing anything bad to it, and meat that is close to its expiration date will be marked down, but sometimes those cuts look pretty bad.  Keep your eyes on it and you should be fine.\\nLi's has taken the place of Taste of Europe, which was here for a short while, and it looks like they did not do a whole lot to change the inside. The layout is essentially the same, and they did certainly put up a few coats of paint, which m\\nakes it look nicer, moving things from Eastern Europe to... somewhere. It might be Asia, it might simply be somewhere with a nicer decor. Regardless, the same smallish interior has not really changed much - a few tables is about all you'll see.\\n\\nThe night we were there, someone was working in back and someone else (I believe it was their son) was working the front. He didn't seem particularly interested, but he was friendly enough. Could have been because it was a weekend night and he didn't want to be working. Or it could have been because we were the only customers, so he was bored. Either way, he did a decent job getting our orders and that is about all that can be asked.\\n\\nWhen it came to the food, most of the menu is occupied by a selection of noodles, and to those you can add vegetables and protein. That's pretty much it. Some of the noodles are the sort you get on a plate, similar to a Pad Thai, while others are more like a soup, such as a Pho. That's about it. They also have som\", 'actual_label': 1, 'predicted_label': 1}, {'text': 'e appetizers, and there isn\\'t a lot here, some rolls and lettuce wraps and the like.\\n\\nEverything we tried was decent, but not stellar. Nothing especially memorable, and portions sizes were good for the price.\\nI have to say it like it is.  If I happen to be in the area - and I usually am not - then Wendy\\'s is probably not my first choice, even if I am looking for something fast.  Bojangles or Chick-Fil-A will probably get the nod, and maybe even Jack-in-the-Box.  If I want something better, there are half a dozen other places.\\n\\nBut if I happen to end up at Wendy\\'s, this is not a bad location.  It can be something of a challenge to get into simply because of where it is.  You can really only access it if you are headed down Sharon Amity, and that is the only way you can exit as well.  If you are going in the other direction, or on Randolph at all, you are pretty much out of luck.  That can make things challenging, and somewhat defeats the purpose of fast food, right?\\n\\nIn any case, assume\\n you do get in (and by extension, that you can then get out again), the place is actually fairly clean and the staff is pretty friendly.  It is a bit dated, but the menu is typical for what you would find in a Wendy\\'s.  Nothing special there.  It is not the new style of building, but it works well enough in a pinch.\\nThere are multiple ways to look at this location.\\n\\n- The store is huge.  I seem to recall them actually enlarging it a few years ago, and frankly, they probably could do with half the space.  The one down the street (at Sharon Amity) is maybe a third of the size and they do fine.  This one has a ton of unused space.  If they do not own it, they are throwing away money.  Or they are charging more to make up for it.\\n\\n- Because of the extra space, you may pay extra.  For that, we do not always shop here for supplies.  You can find good deals around back to school time, but there are usually quantity limits.  So if you need some bulk paper, you might be better off at Wal-Mart. \\n Specialty items however?  I prefer Office Depot to Office Max, and there is no Staples that is as convenient to this side of town.\\n\\n- The staff comes and goes.  Literally.  Over the months and years I have shopped here, very few stay the same.  Understandable.  Even if you see the same person, they will likely be very different from one visit to the next.\\n\\n- On the good side, the rewards program is cool, and you get points back for shopping that you can use on a future visit.  That is always nice.  They also give points to schools for your purchases, which does not help directly, but is a good thing.\\nI can\\'t tell you how many times I have driven past Jake\\'s and had no idea that it was even a restaurant.  It looks like an old gas station.  Probably one that wasn\\'t even in business, or maybe not even open, since there a no pumps.  But they are.  According to reviews, they\\'ve been open for at least a couple of years now.  Interesting.\\n\\nWhatever the case, they do seem to have a dedicated \\nfollowing - so you\\'ll want to get there somewhat early.  We pulled in around 5pm and the place was a ghost town.  By 6 or so, it was almost full.  Consider yourself warned.\\n\\nService was good all around, from the start to the finish.  That\\'s definitely their strong suit.  Unfortunately the food doesn\\'t quite live up to the homey feel of the restaurant or the friendly service provided.\\n\\nWe started on the venison quesadilla.  It was actually really good.  Where venison can sometimes be gamey or even tough, here it worked, and the flavors were excellent.  My wife, who doesn\\'t typically like venison - both for flavor and because it is eating Bambi - enjoyed it.  Though not enough to eat her entire portion, so I was able to finish hers.  Sweet.\\n\\nThen she had a salad wedge.  I\\'ve never been a huge fan of the wedge, because it means you get a head of lettuce and cut it into quarters (or some other section).  Come on - chop it up.  Wedges are a cop out.  But she seemed to enjoy it.\\n\\nFor dinner,\\n she had a flounder sandwich and I had a blackened flounder plate with grit cake.  She enjoyed the sandwich.  My blackened flounder had next to no flavor.  The grit cake wasn\\'t bad, but had a really strange consistency.  Instead of being a cake, it had a very thick outside and an almost runny inside.  Then there was a mixed mess of veggies on the plate, which was probably the best thing that I had.\\n\\nWe also had a blueberry cheesecake thing for dessert.  Not bad, but not overly impressive.  It\\'s like a no-bake cheesecake in a graham cracker pie shell.  I\\'m sure their ingredients were fresher, but about anyone could do something similar in their kitchen in a short amount of time.\\n\\nThough I didn\\'t have a sandwich, I\\'m thinking that\\'s the strong suit here.\\n\\nOf note: They have custom-painted cornhole decks out front, with the initials \"EEK\" on them.  I\\'m wondering if they were done by Erin K. (who has the eek.yelp.com domain).  Erin - is that you?\\n\\nSweet Tea Report: The sweet tea was nicely', 'actual_label': 1, 'predicted_label': 1}, {'text': ' sweet and quite drinkable, and served in glasses that looked like old mason jars.  Cute.\\nOh, Paco, where have you been all my life?  And I am not talking about the Esai Morales character that was hanging out with Sean Penn in the early 80s movie Bad Boys, either.  If he learned to put together a meal like this in a juvenile detention center, then forget reform - more people need to spend time behind bars!\\n\\nWe actually just happened to be in the area, with no particular intention to check them out for restaurant week, but since they had it going on, we stopped in to see what was happening, and were oh-so-glad we did.  The special included a Miss Kitty\\'s margarita, guacamole or ceviche as an appetizer, a salad, fajitas or shrimp for dinner, and either tres leches or fried ice cream and brownie for dessert.\\n\\nSo why just four stars, instead of five?  It was actually a close call.  The service, despite the place being slammed for a Friday night during restaurant week, was spot-on.  But the\\n salad was limp.  Yes, limp.  There was not a crisp piece of lettuce to be found.  To their credit, the fine staff at Paco\\'s even offered to make another to replace it - but I really had no room, and the entree had not even arrived yet.  I was impressed by the offer, however, and hopefully the next visit will see improvements here.  I totally get the desire to prepare for a rush, and putting salads in the fridge in advance is understandable.  But it does knock them down a bit.\\n\\nThe portions definitely did not hurt.  We ate on them for not one, but two meals after we got home.  And the food, with the exception of the salad, was spot-on.  The guacamole was much better than the ceviche (though the ceviche is good - you just get so much more enjoyment out of the guacamole it is ridiculous).\\n\\nPaco\\'s is not for everyone.  Do not take a date and expect a quiet romantic evening.  There are televisions scattered about.  It does have a bit of a noise level to it, but not so much that you cannot \\ntalk during dinner.  And it does get a bit crowded, so if you like to get up (to go to the bathroom, for instance), it might be a tight squeeze.\\n\\nOtherwise, dig in.  It is well worth it.\\nThe ReStore is like a thrift store, sorta.  It\\'s run on donations, but the donations come from all over.  As an individual you can give them stuff if you want, but more often they prefer items that come from businesses (contractors especially).  I was in there when they got a load of granite, and that was pretty cool.  If you need granite, I mean.  What thrift store has granite?\\n\\nWhat you need to realize is that they have a really eclectic selection of stuff.  One area is completely geared towards doing stuff around the house - you can find things like the aforementioned granite, doors, windows, cabinets, sinks, toilets, tile, electrical, who knows.  It just depends on what has come in.\\n\\nThe other section is more like your typical thrift store, where you find furniture, and well, mostly furnishings - t\\nhink mostly furniture, but you can also find pictures and other accessories.  I don\\'t think I\\'ve ever seen clothes there, but that doesn\\'t mean that they don\\'t have them.  We have purchased small appliances (microwaves) and a number of pictures, which may be the best deal in the place.\\n\\nYou can find monster pictures that are way cheaper than if you bought them elsewhere.  Don\\'t know if they are taken out of homes when they are remodeled, or if they are cleaned out of foreclosed homes, but they are definitely good to find here.  We actually have times where we have so many that we can\\'t hang them all.\\n\\nAs Julia says, the furniture is totally hit-and-miss, and we find that for what they have, it\\'s usually (way) overpriced.  But you might be able to find something cool, so take a look.\\nOn a normal day, I don\\'t know that I would give Jimmy John\\'s four stars (sorry Jake!).  Then again, their service might have been better on a normal day.  On this day, however, they were handing out free su\\nbs.  That\\'s right.  FREE SUBS.  Though the line was not as long as it gets for, say, free ice cream at Ben & Jerry\\'s or even pizza at Donato\\'s, it was a pretty good one.\\n\\nPerhaps most importantly was that the line moved rather quickly, even though the location is on the small side and ti was crammed with all these people craving a free sandwich.\\n\\nWhile the line did not illustrate that the Jimmy John\\'s staff are lightning-fast at their jobs at making sandwiches, it can be understood in this case.  The only real problem is that because of that line, the directions for anything other than your sandwich were left a bit nebulous.\\n\\nWant a cookie?  Oh, you should have picked that up at the register... move back three spaces and fight for it with the people now at the register.  But once the process is done, enjoying some sandwich goodness works out well enough!\\nWe don\\'t often get to O\\'Charley\\'s, but since we had a gift card, thought we would check them out. Unfortunately it was not on \"free p', 'actual_label': 1, 'predicted_label': 6}, {'text': 'ie\" day (which is Wednesday, in case you are wondering), but it was still a decent trip.\\n\\nThe sad part is that they seem to be on the decline - just as most of this sort of fast-casual restaurant seem to be. But the staff didn\\'t seem to mind much (or perhaps they were just happy that we were there). So our order came out with a decent amount of speed, and the food was reasonable. Of course, when you\\'re paying with free money, it always helps.\\nReasonable place to stop in for a pizza (or other Italian) dish, but as has been mentioned elsewhere, not a whole bunch better than what you can find anywhere else, notably including your own kitchen - and often for much cheaper.\\n\\nThe nice thing is that they aren\\'t a long ways from our house, which makes it nice, and let\\'s face it - just about anything that you can get from a restaurant can be made at home for cheaper, and that\\'s not the reason we eat out. It\\'s juts easier.\\n\\nIn this case, the service is good, and generally quick. It\\'s just one of \\nthose places that leaves you without much memorable in the end. That is good in that it\\'s not a bad feeling, but it isn\\'t a place you want to return to either, so that can\\'t be a great thing either!\\nOnce upon a time, the only place you could get used merchandise (and clothing, if you\\'re into that) was Goodwill and the Salvation Army.  Then there were other thrift stores, but they come and go.  One that has been around in one form or another is the Bargain Hunters Thrift Store.\\n\\nIt was called the Charlotte Rescue Mission Thrift Store, and I don\\'t honestly know if it is still run by the rescue mission, or if it\\'s even associated with them - but the location is the same, in the old Drug Emporium building on Albemarle Road.\\n\\nThe selection, as with most thrift stores, changes constantly, and you\\'ll find varying quality as well.  The good news is that you\\'ll also find lower prices than at Goodwill or the Salvation Army, and the staff is generally friendly.\\n\\nDrop-offs, if you have anything to\\n donate, are around the back of the center, a fairly scary-looking prospect, but it\\'s typically safe (or has been every time I\\'ve been there), and they are usually closed Sunday and Monday for dropping of your donations.\\n\\nThe selection of clothes is enormous, but make sure you give them a good look, as the clothes in those bright lights, you can miss threadbare spots, stains and any number of problems.  It is often better to stick with books (I have found money between the pages before) and simple games that are playable even if all the pieces are missing.  You may want to stay away from electronics, but that\\'s up to you.\\nI really have no clue about Vietnamese food.  I mean really.  About all I know is that I like it (like it, like it, yes I do).  But I have no idea what goes into it.  Sure, I watch Andrew Zimmern like the next guy, and figure since we are not actually in Vietnam, there probably is not any really odd stuff on the plate in front of me, but what do I really know?  Nothin\\ng.\\n\\nSeveral years ago - by which I could really mean decades - a place I worked took me to Lang Van, which was no mean feat since we were way down on the south side of town.  A quick lunch outing rapidly turned into a couple of hours.  At the time, I really had little to no idea where we were, and it was probably a couple years before I figured out just where this little hole-in-the-wall was located.\\n\\nOnce I did, it was a nice surprise, and even more so when I figured out that the menu was mostly for show unless you really knew what you wanted.  Since I have no idea, it is almost always better just to talk to the server.  The problem there is that it can be completely hit or miss.  Not the food, but the server.  Sometimes they seem to speak very well and understand you well.  Other times, not so much.  The good news is that the food will generally be solid all around.\\n\\nWhile the neighborhood is not the best, the parking lot is on the small side, and the communication can be iffy, it is\\n definitely worth a trip.  Just skip that menu - more than once we have actually spotted something (for instance, the elusive banh mi), only to be told it is not available.  Check that at the door and you should be just fine.\\nI\\'m usually a fan of the Embassy Suites.  Now I\\'m really not so sure.\\n\\nMost nights they have the manager\\'s reception, where you get drinks and snacks.  They do it here as well, but they\\'ve really cut back (we\\'ve been once before).  Where they used to have hot dogs, nachos and tacos, they now have a couple of bins of snack mix and some stale popcorn, as well as someone circling the area with cold appetizers from the restaurant.\\n\\nYou\\'re also allowed to only have two drinks per room.  This is a stark departure from the days when the Embassy would let you have pretty much whatever you could hold during the whole process.  On the upside, they do have a Wii plugged into an old projection television that you can barely see.\\n\\nOnce you\\'re in the room, you\\'ll find that they', 'actual_label': 1, 'predicted_label': 1}, {'text': ' didn\\'t insulate very well, so you can hear everything.  Pipes banging, neighbors doing what neighbors do, people above you using the restroom, it\\'s really bad.  One of the worst hotels for noise that I\\'ve ever used, and I\\'ve even stayed in what seemed to be an old crack house in New York City before.\\n\\nWhile this location seems nice, and even offers balcony rooms, I\\'d suggest not springing for them.  Just a few dollars more, you can get a balcony on the back side of the hotel that \"overlook the golf course\".  What the really means is that you get to see the roof of the building just a few floors below, some trees and you get some really bright spotlights flooding your room at all hours of the night (really - I don\\'t think they ever go off).  On the other side of the treeline, there is a golf course.  I think.  I don\\'t care if it\\'s a quarter, it\\'s not worth the extra money.  I don\\'t think it\\'s even worth it if it\\'s a free upgrade.\\n\\nThe one place I will give them a decent mark is in the \\ncomplimentary breakfast.  The crew manning the omelet station specifically was very friendly and did a great job.  Unfortunately, the rest of the breakfast bar wasn\\'t good at all.  Trays were running low, juice was running out, and overall it was just a bit sad.\\n\\nOn one other note - they do accept pets here.  But you have to pay extra for that room (apparently you get a mat, and they will supply you with bowls if you forgot them).  But that\\'s it.  And you have to pay a $50 non-refundable security deposit.\\n\\nThey also offer access to the Internet - both wired and wireless - but you have to be $10 a day for it.  So if I were you, I\\'d wait until the Great Wolf opens across the street, and see if things get better, because this place is just sad.\\nWith all the cold weather, and specifically snow, you would think it was time to visit a place with a name like \"Olaf\" (you know, from Frozen? Come on, people), but I couldn\\'t find one of those - so instead we went with Beauty and the Beast, and Lu\\nmiere.\\n\\nActually, the movie - and the name, and the climate - had little to do with it. The restaurant had simply been on the list for a while, and it was finally time to check them off. Good thing, as their service was amazing. Though we did not have a reservation, and probably aren\\'t used to such places, they did not mind a bit, happy to take my raggedy self in, and they were great all around - even offering a splash of wine to go with our appetizers (of course, they were likely hoping we would get some more, but we\\'ll get some next time).\\n\\nTo compliment the service, the food was also excellent - not everything was completely to our taste, but there are going to be times when you don\\'t like everything, and that\\'s okay - the fact is that it was prepared really well, and the service was spot on, which made it a great evening, so we will definitely be back to try more of the items on their menu.\\nWine bars are not really my thing. But a wine bar with food? I will definitely give that a t\\nry. So we checked them out on a weekend morning for their brunch menu. Actually showed up as they opened. And \"as they opened\" means at the time their hours said they opened.\\n\\nTurns out the door was open, but no one was around. Stood looking goofy (which I do really well) for a few minutes, and was just about to leave when someone came out and seemed happy to see us. We were seated and a few minutes later our order was placed.\\n\\nAfter a while, we had some food. It wasn\\'t bad food, but it wasn\\'t great.\\n\\nAnd more importantly, the wait was loooong. If you\\'re there for wine, and sitting and enjoying the wine, then it would probably not be an issue. But if you\\'re going for a meal, and perhaps more importantly, have things to do, perhaps not the greatest choice.\\n\\nThe decor is nice, and the location is interesting - and there are other places around that also seem worth checking out as well - but if you want to go for a meal, it\\'s probably not the best option.\\nTypically, the Matthews Community\\n Farmers\\' Market is only open into November on Saturdays (and August on Wednesdays).  This year, at least, you can visit on December 22 from 4-6pm for a special Christmas Market and December 29 from 4-6pm for a New Year\\'s Market.  There are also Saturdays in January 2011 where they will be open, so check the web site if interested.\\n\\nAs to the market itself - it\\'s not the Charlotte Regional (off Yorkmont).  That market is huge by comparison.  But it\\'s also not the Mint Hill Market, which is similar to a yard sale with a lemonade stand or two on most weekends.  Most dates have a good selection of stands, and it is well attended, but as with many of the Charlotte-area markets, you need to get there early (even more so in the winter months).\\n\\nDuring normal (summer) hours, if you\\'re there at noon, there may be nothing left.  In the winter, go when they open.  Since the market only operates for a couple hours, if you wait until the end of the second hour, you might miss out entirely.\\n\\nThe ap', 'actual_label': 1, 'predicted_label': 1}, {'text': 'peal of this market is not the size, it\\'s the community aspect, and that is a good thing, so make sure to check it out.

But these days, I just don\\'t bother.  Between the time it takes to look, clip, categorize and keep up with all of that, and then figure out who has the lowest price where, I don\\'t have the time.\\n\\nRather than figure out all of that, we just shop at Aldi.  Yes, I know that the selection isn\\'t as wide, but for your typical staples, I don\\'t need to have fifteen types of green beans, one will do nicely.  If I happen to need some unusual spice or other item that isn\\'t carried at Aldi, I\\'ll pick it up when I go to Sam\\'s.  Otherwise, I get the standard fare at Aldi, and I don\\'t spend all that time worrying about it.\\n\\nJust make sure you bring a quarter (for the cart - you get it back when you\\'\\nre done) and cash or an ATM card, because Aldi doesn\\'t take checks or credit cards.\\nMy first exposure to Upstream was a few years ago at one of those \"taste of\" events, when all sorts of places from around town bring samples of their wares, and for a few bucks you can buy a little plate with something on it.  We had teriyaki salmon, and it was just awesome.  Ever since, we\\'ve been meaning to go by and try their real food.\\n\\nSo we went.  I\\'d have to agree with a lot of others in that the atmosphere is just a little too stuffy for my own personal taste.  It\\'s a nice place, and you really don\\'t have to dress up - we went in jeans - but it\\'s just so \"pretty\".  The staff is nice, they are relatively attentive and all, but it just seems so wrong.  I\\'d much rather go somewhere that\\'s a little grizzled.\\n\\nIn any case the menus were delivered and we decided to try the spring roll appetizers, and they were actually quite good.  I liked that there were two of us, and they split the appetizer onto t\\nwo plates.  That\\'s a nice touch.  Most places give you one plate and you\\'re left to do it yourself.  Another nice thing is that the bread comes with melted butter.  That\\'s cool.\\n\\nI ordered the sea bass, on the suggestion of the server, who said it is \"far and away\" the best thing on the menu, while my wife had a sirloin.  The flavor of the fish was good, but it was just so sponge-like I had a difficult time eating it.  The texture was just strange.  The steak, meanwhile, was really good.  Odd, at a seafood place.\\n\\nOverall, it was decent, but it wasn\\'t cheap by any means.  I think we\\'d rather go to the more fun and much better McCormick and Schmick\\'s, as it\\'s just more our style, and the food is typically better (and it\\'s cheaper to boot).\\nIf you do not like Gander Mountain or REI  - or are not in the vicinity of either for some reason - and just do not feel like walking to the other end of Concord Mills (a challenging task, to be sure), then Sun & Ski Sports may be for you.\\n\\nThis bouti\\nque has a strong selection of footwear and other specialized gear for a number of sports, and perhaps most importantly, their staff is more than happy to help you - perhaps because there are not usually too many people inside.\\n\\nAs has been mentioned, the only problem is that their prices can be on the high end.  But if you do not have time to drive all over town, and are not interested in waiting for something you order online, it might be your only choice.\\nBed, Bath and Beyond is cool.  It\\'s one of those places you can walk in and say \"I want that\" about a hundred times, and then as you\\'re walking through the store you realize just how useless the stuff you\\'re carrying really is.\\n\\nBy the time you make it to the register, you may have absolutely nothing that you need.  That\\'s why they keep sending out those discount coupons in the mail.  But it sure is a lot of neat stuff to look at as you walk through the store.\\nThough I don\\'t often go to Concord Mills for shopping, I do catch a movie\\n at the theater now and again.  It used to be on Saturday mornings, because they had a $4 show before noon.  Now it\\'s still on Saturday morning, but it\\'s gone up to $5.  Though this stinks, the times have expanded, and you can catch a show for $5 more often during the week.\\n\\nThe good news is that most of the auditoriums have stadium seating, and though only a couple have really good sound, at least the seats are comfortable in all of them.  I can\\'t speak to the snack bars, because they are even more overpriced than the movies have become - but they sure look nice.\\n\\nI also wish that the self-service machines out front would work more often.  But usually in the mornings the lines aren\\'t bad, so that\\'s not as big a deal as it would be at night.\\nThere is little argument that Woodlands is some legit Indian food, and vegetarian to boot.

So I called here to see if the rollerball was sold here since it is a store, not a kiosk. I spoke with Alma, who told me that it was free as long as I am a T-Mobile customer. I went here after work. She assisted me (told me that she was the one I spoke with on the phone). There were two other reps there and one other customer besides myself. She had a hard time getting the new one in there, but David helped her, by using a paper clip, and presto! a new rollerball installed- THANK YOU guys. I gave her my number so she could record it. I appreciated their help. \\n\\nAfter not being able to use my cell phone for many hours today, I had 25 e-mails to tend to afterward, at home. I dropped it this morning, and this was the first time either. I need to be more careful from now on.\\nLocated on the corner in a small strip mall off Warm Springs, this is more of a locals place. A really dark bar with a Pub feel- the ceiling is neat, architectural detai\\nl (if you\\'ve got those dark prescription glasses, watch your step); outside there is a fireplace, which is neat for cold nights. It\\'s smoky, so your clothes might wreak of the smell, just a warning (I don\\'t smoke, so it\\'s not at all appealing to me). Some booths are located on the left upon entering. I can\\'t tell you too much of the rest of the place because we pretty much stayed at the booth the whole time.  \\n\\nThe bartender seated us at lunch time; she was nice, took our drink and food order, and returned to her station (the bar). The menu was pretty big, for being a bar, and the prices were pretty reasonable (average price being around $7.00). I think the cook delivered the food to us, because I saw him in the kitchen, from where we were seated. \\n\\nMy father-in-law said that the chicken fingers (there are different flavors, like regular, spicy, and teriyaki) and waffle cut fries were really delicious, but I didn\\'t feel like having a full order of either, so I got the nachos (my husban\\nd didn\\'t like it- said it was plain, no beans and no meat). But my appetite hasn\\'t been the same since my operation last month (ok, a funny story, so my husband\\'s friends came to visit last month, and her mom said \"I don\\'t know where she puts it\"- it\\'s funny, but yes, I like to eat!), so I was fine with it. It was a big platter, came with two plates, chips topped with cheese (could\\'ve used more cheese, though), jalapenos (love the heat), salsa, olives, and one generous scoop each of sour cream and guacamole (love guacamole). I\\'m sort of a nachos buff when it comes to the weekends or vacation, so this was alright, by my standards. My husband let me sample a chicken finger and some fries. The chicken fingers are mostly meat, not composed mostly of yucky batter which seems to be the norm at most places; very good! The waffle fries were thick but golden, and were really good, as well, not soggy and soacked in oil, like most places. I had a chicken fingers phase when I was in my 20s, so I d\\non\\'t usually get them or eat them a lot these days. I\\'d probably order something else next time, so I could split the order with my husband (like we usually do). \\n\\nThe service could\\'ve been more better (checked on us once), but the chicken fingers and waffle fries were very good, and the prices were reasonable, so it\\'s safe to say that we will be back again (ok, and my FIL really loves the fingers and fries, plus it\\'s in his nick of the woods too).\\nI love this seafood buffet. Many casinos claim to be a seafood buffet but this one really delivers. (There\\'s only one other one that is pretty good and is off the Strip- Sam\\'s Town.) When this buffet first opened, the lines were ridiculous.  If you weren\\'t waiting in line by 4 pm, you\\'d be waiting for a very long time- seriously. I hadn\\'t been in a while, until within the last few years with my husband- it\\'s going to be an anniversary tradition.\\n\\nThe selection is amazing- broken into region types- Mediterranean, Pacific Rim, South America, N\\north America. Langostino lobster (delicious), snow crab legs (a little salty at times but very good), dungeness crab (mmmm), oysters, peel and eat shrimp (with lemon and cocktail sauce- just like at the resident buffet, very good), crawfish (not a fan), sushi (I\\'ll pass- sushi has to be eaten at a real sushi place), and soups (like chowder), just to name a few. The quality of many of the dishes is very good. \\n\\nThe dessert station is not as big or impressive as the other resident buffet, but by that time, one has eaten enough, right? Ha-ha, just kidding. I usually save room for dessert. And given the choice, it\\'s almost always ice cream or gelato, in this case. \\n\\nThe last time we ate here, there was a wedding party of about 20 people. Seating is mostly chairs and tables, with some booth seating. The ambiance is much nicer at this buffet compared to the regular resident buffet, with artwork is cheeky- fish, but it\\'s cute. The paint colors are warm neutrals, browns. It\\'s not so crowded an', 'actual_label': 2, 'predicted_label': 2}, {'text': \"ymore, maybe could be due to the price. The service is pretty good- drinks refilled and the dirty plates are taken away. The food stations are clean and maintained/refilled. \\n\\nYes, it can be pricey, but I think that this seafood buffet is actually worth it and not many seafood buffets in casinos are true seafood buffets, either. It seems like these casinos have shrimp and slap on a name, Seafood Buffet, but it's simply false advertising, in my opinion. I've heard that the M Resort's buffet is very good, but we have yet to try it. For now, enjoy coming here though.\\nThis is probably my 2nd visited location; I used to come here to check out the Adidas inventory (sometimes they had different stuff). This store became a more-visited store, because of the Sephora addition; so you can say my interest was revived. There are lots of Sephora stores on the Strip (Forum, Venetian, Miracle Mile. and further up, at Town Square), but this is the only one on this side of town. Not counting the Strip, \\nthis would be the closest location to my home. Whenever we're in the mall, we stop by here, because of Sephora; located on the lower level, near the jewelry counter. I love Sephora- the brands, the perks of being a Beauty Insider member, the samples, trying out the different products, demos by the employees, etc.  \\n\\nIt's worth checking out the Clearance section (the womens clothing is around the corner from Sephora) but I haven't found anything recently- and sometimes it is a mess. There are two levels to this store. The lower level has jewelry, Sephora, womens and mens clothing, and handbags. Upstairs is the home section (linens, kitchen appliances) and children's clothing. \\n\\nIf you're in the area, and need something basic from Sephora (it's a smaller store), definitely check this store out.\\nI'm not a hunter, camper (never been, but I don't mind, because I'm a certified city girl- I do love hiking in Hawaii while on vacation, though), or extreme outdoor adventurer (maybe I would, but \\nmy husband's got a heights thing), but this tremendous place still impresses. We went here (a couple weeks ago) to see the Christmas display on the bottom floor (not a huge one, so my husband was disappointed) and to check out Santa (free photo during certain times; we went in the afternoon on a sunday, and there was quite a line for pictures). The animal displays (giraffe, moose) are neat to see (yes, they are real; they were hunted, after the meat was taken, they were donated) all throughout the store. The aquarium is neat, but still not sure what that large fish was (?), and there is bench seating in front of it. Also located on the bottom floor is a small section of Christmas ornaments (not our taste though), marine section, food pantry (packaged) section, outdoor clothing, and cash registers. On the upper level is the hunter section, shooting range, other weapons, and clothing. There is a stairwell overlooking a waterfall (pretty water feature). This entrance/exit leads to the cas\\nino. There is a huge parking lot. I'm not sure if concerts are still held here.\\nThis is probably my 2nd visited Hallmark store, as I usually go to the one on Maryland Parkway. We went here on monday night (had a coupon to use); we usually stop by here, anyway when we're at this mall, too. (Since this was Pet Picture night with Santa, there was a crowd in front of the store.) There were a few customers besides us. There were a couple ladies manning the registers (didn't see any other employees). \\n\\nEverything is easy to find, except I was trying to find the 99 cents section of greeting cards- there is no defined section (Maryland does), but there are a few selections that are in that price range. All the seasonal items (snoopy ringer) are in the front, the keepsake ornaments are located along the front left wall of the store, and the christmas wrapping paper rolls are along the right side, on the back wall. The novelty items (yankee candles, jewelry, other gifts) are on the left side, to\\nwards the back of the store. In comparison to the Maryland store (freestanding), this is small. However, there is still a good selection of greeting cards here. \\n\\nDon't forget to use your card (dark purple) to get credit for your purchases. Both ladies at checkout were nice.\\nFormerly known as Belz. The newly instituted renovations include: combo carpet/floor inside (don't like this much), larger stores outside front and center, facing Las Vegas Boulevard- Fossil (this one has clothing), Coach, Anne Taylor Loft (yes!!! i love this store), Reebok, Rockport, True Religion, Under Armour, Gap, Michael Kors, and many others- this particular section is very nice (there are numerous benches with canopies to take a break). \\n\\nThis indoor outlet mall has two food courts (bathrooms inside), a carousel, a customer service desk (get your discount booklet here), and bathrooms in the middle, as well.  The large Nike outlet store (excellent selection of shoes) is on the same side as Burlington Brands (\", 'actual_label': 2, 'predicted_label': 2}, {'text': \"cheap basics for men and women). On the other side, opposite, is the Vanity Fair outlet store (great for undies and bras). All the beach/surf brands are inside too, like Hurley, PacSun, RipCurl, Quiksilver, Billabong (love this store), Element, O'Neill,  & Volcom. A few other stores are worth looking at here too, like Windsor & Esprit (few stores in town). \\n\\nThe aisles are packed with kiosks (those multi-wrap dresses, the massage group, the flat irons, the fake hair pieces, the miche bags)- get ready for the swapmeet hustle here, folks. During Christmas time, it's awfully hard to walk through here, when there are particularly lots of shoppers. I would suggest coming here pretty early or pretty late during the holidays. \\n\\nWe go to Premium/North (open-air) quite a bit and on a regular basis, and find lots more deals there, especially at our favorite stores (Fossil/Quiksilver/Banana Republic/Disney/Harry & David just to mention a few stores). So of course, this mall edges out Premium/Sout\\nh. \\n\\nOverall, this is a clean mall, with regular maintenance being done (i see cleaning people all the time). I didn't notice any security guards the last few times we came here. There is ample parking space available. The best spots to park are in front of Burlington Brands and the VF outlet store (opposite ends). Also, there is more shopping and restaurants (Chipotle, Samurai Sam's, Tropical Smoothie Cafe, Chili's, and so many others) at two other sections (not attached to the mall). Our most recent visit was two days ago (and we went here the previous week, to check out the shoes at Nike). I'm anticipating the new Banana Republic store's opening November 1st.\\nThis is actually for 4.5 stars.\\n\\nStopped in last week to get some produce on sale, like strawberries for $1.99 for a pound, and a bag of cuties for $3.49. This one, located in the Wal-Mart shopping center, is much nicer than the Tropicana store; like a brighter, cleaner, shinier version- hence the edge in stars for my review. I\\n came here for specific items (sale items) plus we had just shopped at Wal-Mart too. But not as much as the Tropicana location (convenient to my workplace and on the way home). The frozen selections (low fat meals) were slightly higher than Smith's pricing. \\n\\nNice setup, clean store, few shoppers, and speedy checkout.\\nFirst off, I used to eat these bagels up all the time when I worked in a real estate office (you could never be your goal weight at a real estate office- and I worked at three of those offices), that is until I found out that each one was about 500 calories! So then, I'd just have half of one, and the other half at another time. These bagels are super soft (not hard like the supermarket brands). My favorite was the cranberry one; blueberry was my second choice.\\n\\nI had gotten two gift cards over Christmas (total of $20), and so we came here for lunch on sunday. I got the turkey panini (spinach, bacon, tomatoes with onion & chive shmear) and my husband got the turkey sandwi\\nch, everything bagel (sprouts, cucumber, lettuce, tomato with onion & chive shmear)- you can also customize these sandwiches to your liking (didn't know that when we ordered)- many different shmears and type of bread. My husband chose the cheddar sun chips as his side, while I chose an orange (also, apples are available). Both sandwiches were really good; yes, we split them. When my husband asked which one I liked better, I couldn't decide, I liked them both. (Check the site for nutritional information.) \\n\\nThere's also egg sandwiches, snacks (similar to Starbucks), and coffee, oops, almost forgot about the many different bagels- classic bagels (plain, everything), bagel-thins (plain, everything, honey-wheat), signature bagels (blueberry, cranberry, sesame seed, cinnamon sugar, chocolate chip, etc.), gourmet bagels (power bagel, six cheese, dutch apple)- 24 types in these categories, bagel poppers, and bulk bagels (popular for offices). \\n\\nThere were a lot of people dining in when we wen\\nt inside, but when we were seated, the crowd diffused (popular place). You order it (right side), pay for it (left side), and take your seats; someone will bring it to you when it's ready (toasted and warmed). Coffee and drinks (free refills) are located to the left of the restaurant, facing UNLV and Maryland Parkway. Clean location. There were three people working here. Bathrooms are toward the other entrance/exit doors. Upon entering (to your right), there is an adjoining door to Wells Fargo Bank. This location has been here a while (located in an ever-changing strip mall); strategic placement across from the university ensures a steady customer base.\\nI should preface by saying that I do not own a pair of these shades but I have bought them (special occasions) for my husband- it's his favorite. Since we were nearly done with Christmas shopping, we were able to get a little something for ourselves (an early Christmas gift).\\n\\nThe shades on sale- the prices are pretty good considering h\", 'actual_label': 2, 'predicted_label': 2}, {'text': 'ow expensive these shades are- (some are final sale- which you cannot return) are in locked tall glass cases (you will need assistance) located on the right side, near the walls filled with clothing (women\\'s clothing- on the left side is men\\'s BTW). The cash registers are at the very back- two cash registers. The soft lens case (doubles as lens cleaner) is also included with your purchase of shades BTW. If the shades are scratched, the cashier will replace the scratched ones with new ones- nice. \\n\\nThe setup is fine but when there are lots of people, it can get crowded (it\\'s popular). The aisles are pretty narrow since the middle row is primarily more racks and tables of clothing- lots of clothing, really, since the first thing I think of when I see the brand, is the shades. There is a small section of shades on the left side- my husband only went to this section a few times, mostly goes to the sale cases. \\n\\nGo for the sales on the shades.\\nThe ownership of the company has changed about \\n4x since getting this service over five years ago. The service is very good- at less than $40 a month, we have round the clock monitoring and if the alarm is tripped, security is dispatched (at no additional charge), to check the home\\'s status. It\\'s worth having that peace of mind. The alarm is very loud- I\\'m sure our neighbors hear it, I know some dogs hear it, because there is barking shortly thereafter. Sometimes we forget about the alarm being on, and then minutes later, we get a phone call to see if we are alright. It is advised to test the system once a month. Just call the center and they will walk you through it. I would highly recommend this service.\\n\\nWe also use this company at one of our office locations. If we are having some work done (swamp coolers), I call the center to place the system on \"test\" mode for a few hours. It\\'s very easy dealing with them- the operators are always very nice and pleasant on the telephone.\\nThis is a two level store located at the Galleria Mall \\nin Henderson. We\\'ve been here a couple times in the past month. Here\\'s a tip: the cashiers upstairs are more busy than the ones located downstairs. Some select gift cards are located in between the Kitchen department and the cashiers. Kitchen, linens, and home decor is located upstairs. Clothing is located on the lower level. This is a clean store BTW (also seems more spacious as compared to the one on Nellis Ave.). \\n\\nWe were in the market for a flannel comforter (but it seems like very few stores carry this), so we settled on a soft big fleece blanket 60 x 90 (will use this as a topper for our existing bedding). We were also looking for K-cups (was on sale around this time last year), but we settled on the large variety pack (48), since there was a 2 day special. \\n\\nWhat we love about Kohls stores in general, are their ongoing promotions- (1) the coupons sent in the mail, for an additional 30% (sometimes, 10, or 20%) off your purchase, when using the charge card, and (2) Kohls cash- $1\\n0 vouchers are given for every $50 denomination that you spend (if you return an item later, the Kohls cash is null and void). What is weird about these stores, are the small odd- shaped shopping carts (not able to accommodate everything they sell), and the smaller stores, have very small aisles. \\n\\nBoth items with the discount and sale, were around $51.00! And we got Kohls cash, too. I suppose the coupon offers and the Kohls cash attracts more shoppers (competitor JCP offers rewards on the spot, now) and continues to do well, even in this economy.\\nWe saw this show a couple times when my husband\\'s step-dad worked at The Trop.\\n\\nThat said, it\\'s a great show performed by a guy who really cares about his exotic pet co-stars. Part of the clever marketing is incorporating some clips featured in a DVD, which we bought and watched several times, thank you very much. The tricks using these huge cats is quite impressive and entertaining.\\n\\nOut of the three shows featuring these animals (white tige\\nrs, bengal tigers, spotted leopards, black panthers, and a rare liger), I like this the one the most (maybe because we get to see such a gorgeous array of animals).  Rick Thomas is a close second.  ( I liked Siegfried and Roy\\'s show the least- I\\'m probably one of the few who didn\\'t like it, but I stand my ground.) This is a family-friendly show that the kids will enjoy. \\n\\nThe theater was nice and intimate- we got booth seats- sometimes you are seated with strangers.\\n\\nThere\\'s a \"meet and greet\" after the show. We got a free signed poster with purchase.\\nThis is a small property as far as casinos go (like Palms, Main Street Station, California). But there is a large parking lot and it\\'s also attached to Bass Pros Shop (an aquarium and many stuffed animal displays throughout the two-level store/attraction). This is what sets this casino apart from others. In addition to the aquariums inside (Mermaid Bar?), there is a huge one, with small sharks and rays along with fish, and if you\\'re lucky', 'actual_label': 2, 'predicted_label': 2}, {'text': \" enough to see the feeding, it's pretty cool (I could stare at aquariums and sea life for a long time). The last time we came to this property it was christmas time ('11), and there were quite a few people here- lots of families. \\n\\nThe property has undergone a big transformation in recent years (my husband said that it looked totally different since he's worked here and that a restaurant was moved or eliminated; then it was called Boom Town). A few years ago, my brother and his family stayed here because there was a special promotion going on for nearby residents, and their room was really very nice! Since it's a newer property, the furniture was more modern and contemporary rather than tired, outdated or kitschy.\\nI was introduced to this restaurant years ago, by some Korean co-workers who took me to lunch here. I had the Bi Bim Bap, which was sooooo good. It's my favorite Korean dish to this day- an egg on top of, tender beef, mixed vegetables, spinach, and kimchee, over white rice an\\nd hot sauce- that you mix all together, served in a stainless bowl. \\n\\nWe used to come here for the lunch special- shrimp fried rice- which really sounds weird to get here, but it's really good. They don't offer the special on holidays, so we stopped coming (yet the sign advertising it still stands outside). (I went here with a friend for the sushi special but he didn't like it.) The service is ok. Usually, there is maybe two other parties at most, like the other reviewers mentioned. The server would disappear, maybe to the other side, which is a sushi bar. I also agree with one of the reviewers that this place needs a makeover or something because it looked a little tired the last time. \\n\\nThere are so many other Korean restaurants now that I would rather go elsewhere.\\nWe are exploring our new area and this is a gem! Kept finding coupons (with menu) in the local weekly paper for this restaurant and decided to try this new place. Saw the good reviews on yelp as well as the menu. Yelp che\\nck-ins get 20% off.\\n\\nIt's a small place (a dozen tables, and a pair of tall stools at the bar), but has very elegant ambiance (one wall features brick, not the traditional full size kind, the partial but pretty type), which is unexpected, in a strip mall. The tables are dark wood (we opted for the booth). The dinnerware is dark but is in line with the overall theme. It is sit-down, but you can order takeout too.  \\n\\nThe food is asian fusion. We got the pan fried noodles with pork tenderloin, combination fried rice, and the ramen noodle soup (including mushrooms, green onions, seaweed, mmm) with shredded chicken. It was excellent. Everything was delicious. The cuts of meat were exceptional. The beef was angus. The pork tenderloin was lean. The shredded chicken breast was clean, no veins, no tubes, perfect. Come to think of it, there was no fat in any of the meat (high quality). Nothing was overdone or salty. Hubby, son, & I enjoyed dinner very much. Also, the portions were quite generous\\n. We had leftovers, mmm.\\n\\nThere was another family eating dinner, besides us, and later, another family. The service was excellent. The owner and the entire staff was very nice and attentive. Also, the owner did something really nice, she modified the chopsticks for our son, and proceeded to show him how to eat the fried rice. \\n\\nWe will be back.\\nThis is my favorite radio station. For music, it's a good mix of hip hop, freestyle, and dance music- in other words, music to dance to at a party. It allows me to enjoy my morning commute. Just like the name of the station, it's music that makes me feel good. And sometimes relive a memory when I hear a song from back in the day. Hope the format stays the same.\\nI've been liking Ross stores more, because there are lots of reasonable items for the home, and we usually find shoes for our son here (children grow fast, so we are constantly trying to keep up). Whenever we are in the immediate area stopping here is a must. There are quite a few dining\\n options, so it's a no-brainer. Sometimes, in the late afternoon, it does get pretty busy here. So we've been trying to get their before and after that time frame. \\n\\nSo, we like to check out the luggage, the childrens shoes, the home department (towels/ kitchen/ storage), our son always wants to check out the toys, hubby checks out the k-cups coffee, I check out the activewear (I'm always looking for Fabletics), beauty (I'm looking for the natural beauty items), and sometimes the womens shoes (I'm looking for Toms). \\n\\nIt's pretty clean inside, too. The bathrooms are located near the dressing rooms. If there isn't a crowd, checkout is fast. The customer base is mostly families with children.\\nI've been to the few bead stores around town, and this one is the best!!! I am so serious when I say that I've gone to bead heaven- it was almost overwhelming- the selection of semi-precious beads (love, love, love it!), freshwater pearls, and crystal beads (imitation swarovski) is vast and in so ma\", 'actual_label': 2, 'predicted_label': 2}, {'text': 'ny colors and shapes (rondelles, round, square, nuggets, baroque, the list could go on and on). It is a very long space, bright and welcoming- and everything is laid out on the tables, in rows, very neatly- the strands are bunched in groups of five and rubber banded (you simply pull the one that you want off). Baskets are located on the tables all around. I had to go around a couple times because there were so many semi-precious stones that I wanted. The prices are clearly tagged on each strand of beads. There are specials: $5.00 per strand for certain gemstones, and many are 70% off the marked price (seriously). I\\'ve gotten some semi-precious gemstones at Michael\\'s but the quality is just ok. I\\'ve gotten a few strands at two mail order places online. But some don\\'t offer free shipping. Among my favorites here: tourmaline, agate, peruvian opal, green jade, angelite, quartz, lapis lazuli, citrine, peridot, labradorite, rose quartz, and of course the list goes on! \\n\\nI immediately told my\\n husband that I would love a gift card/certificate here. The nice cashier said that one could give her the money and the receipt would be proof, then simply deduct my store visit\\'s purchases. (I could see myself spending serious $$$ here. Jewelry making is the latest hobby for me. And I\\'ve made some stunning pieces- bracelets and necklaces. I\\'ve also made a couple pieces for my husband.)\\n\\nThere are also Jade dragons for sale on book cases. A buddha statue with a \"Don\\'t Touch\" sign is also on display located twoards the middle of the store.  There is a bathroom for both men and women towards the back (facing Sahara). The findings (only two rows on one table) is very little but that\\'s ok because the prices are good. The bead supplies are also hanging on the walls. The inventory here could easily be in the millions. My husband saw a strand marked $400. I don\\'t remember what it was, though.    \\n\\nOpen everyday (yay!). This is the third location for the family business originated from Texas.\\n I told her that this was a really good store (set-up and selection) and the location is right down the street from us too. I don\\'t have to rely on the websites for my semi-precious stones needs anymore. And findings are vast at Michael\\'s.\\nBeen coming here for years- just to see the airplanes landing for FREE and I didn\\'t know the official name for this place! Some people would hang out in their cars away from the wind and the noise (hmm, could they be?), others sit on the hood of the car, and yet others, are up close and personal with the fence, literally, noses pressed (kids). \\n\\nThere was one place in the Bay Area, where I would escape to, and it was Ocean Beach (still my favorite beach there- don\\'t ask me why, just holds a special place in my heart), for years, this was the place for me to chill and reflect; quiet time, no problem seemed too big here. Apparently, others feel the same. For the most part, other people are doing the same exact thing- looking at the planes landing, and \\nwouldn\\'t bother you. Usually this would be a night-time visit. I think I came here once (after clubbing) in the morning, but it got really bright. There\\'s a gas station/mini-mart down the way, if you wanted to get coffee or a sweet treat to enjoy while you\\'re watching these planes.\\nThe showcase parking garage (about five or so levels?) is $3.00 for every vehicle entering, even if you\\'re watching a movie here. Be careful when you exit, because it is very narrow on the single lane down, and watch for traffic; there is a stop sign for people exiting. Also, there are two ways to go- left to Koval (i\\'m guessing) and right- to Las Vegas Blvd/ the Strip (it\\'s a light, so you don\\'t have to worry so much about pedestrian traffic). I do agree with LJR on the beautiful views from the parking garage. \\n\\nThe elevator has a bridge option. Go to the 1st floor for the movie theater. Other notable attractions/restaurants nearby: M & M\\'s World, Coca Cola, Tix Tonight (discount tickets to shows), Hard Roc\\nk Cafe, Showcase Food Court.\\n\\nThis is an older movie theater by Las Vegas standards. This was built right before the in-casino boom. The ticket counter is outside. When you walk in, there is a small concession stand, to your left. To the right are the bathrooms (side by side, for men and women, but not single) and coin-operated candy machines (mini ducks, monkey hangers, stickers, etc.). The women\\'s bathroom was pretty clean. \\n\\nWe went here last night. This particular one had three areas to sit. We sat in the middle towards the front. The first four rows were left empty. The seats were just as I remembered- uncomfortable and stationary (not staggered, and for me (I\\'m short), when it\\'s like this, I\\'m just hoping someone really tall doesn\\'t sit right in front of me). The seat next to our friend, had gum on it (yeah, gross), so it was empty. My husband said the screen to the right of it had a line of green light. \\n\\nI agree with Connie R. and Matthew C. that this is an older theater and it', 'actual_label': 2, 'predicted_label': 2}, {'text': '\\'s seen better days. It would be nice if there were a renovation project (better seats and a better system) but not likely as the economy is not so great right now. It\\'s basic, and it\\'s on the Strip, and it\\'s alright. I\\'ll close with that.\\nI thought I wrote one up for this one, already, whoops! We\\'ve gone here several times, and we like it so much better than the original one on Decatur.  We went here a few weeks ago for lunch, while we were in the area.\\n\\nI really like the ambiance here. It\\'s not dark (think dungeon) like the other one (Decatur), and it feels festive, in here, but not overdone (my favorite for ambiance is casa don juan btw). The tables, chairs, and booths are spaced just right (though we always get seated next to a loud talking person, go figure, almost like they want other people to hear their life stories, had to tune them out, though). In other words, it doesn\\'t feel cramped in here. \\n\\nThe people working here are very nice and inviting (smiles and greetings). Our se\\nrver was pretty good. There is another person tending to the drink refills, but I don\\'t think she speaks much english and is a bit timid. The hostess is very welcoming. This is a Entertainment Book participant (BOGO). The prices are very good too.  \\n\\nThe salsa is very good here. I love the spicy salsa- mmm, and my husband likes the regular one (he can\\'t do spicy). So, you get two kinds of salsa with chips (careful, so easy to over do it, before you know it, you\\'re not hungry anymore). I usually get the fish tacos but I really wanted ceviche this time (shrimp and crab, served with tostados and sliced avocado). The ceviche is served in a bowl, and is tasty, but I needed to add Tapatio, for some heat. I also added some spicy salsa, too. I didn\\'t finish it- I took the rest home. My husband usually gets a burrito (but it had all the things he dislikes) but he surprised me by getting the fish tacos (2), served with rice, and beans. He really liked it. I had a bite too, but it\\'s my go-to dish\\n, so it wasn\\'t a new thing for me. \\n\\nGood Mexican food that is reasonably priced (good portion size) along with nice ambiance is kind of hard to come by here; sure, there are lots of copycats in this town, so this restaurant is really appreciated.\\nI have mixed feelings about this department. Once, a couple of pit bulls ended up in our backyard (twice this happened). They were nice dogs, but since we have two dogs of our own, we could not have them wait for pickup inside our home. We ended up waiting for animal control to pick up these dogs, about four or five hours- which tied up our day. We had them secured in another area, away from our dogs. \\n\\nWe are responsible pet owners (pick up their feces regularly- this is what we do, when we walk our dogs in public, at parks or around our neighborhood) as well as considerate neighbors. When we had complaints, we found a solution. But alas, we have inconsiderate neighbors who had five small loud barking dogs, at one point (it\\'s illegal- you ha\\nve to have a breeder\\'s license now). When there were complaints about them, they claimed that they did not speak English. They\\'ve gone down to two dogs, however, they leave them outside in the backyard to bark all hours of the night. I can\\'t tell you how many times they\\'ve done so- that\\'s how frequent (and it so happens to be right outside our bedroom window where their dogs are kept). (When we first moved in, over five years ago, these same neighbors had two huge turkeys, ducks, and more than a dozen chickens and roosters- this is illegal in Las Vegas city limits. If you\\'re in an area marked \"Horse Property\" I think that area of the city is fine with these kinds of animals.) These are the same neighbors who will do handywork in their yard at 6:30 am- I think they believe that other people in the neighborhood are up that early on weekends (or maybe they don\\'t care about the noise ordinance law- 7am-10 pm).\\n\\nHere\\'s a summary of the process: complaints are recorded, two complaints are gi\\nven to the offender, before going to court to file officially. I haven\\'t gone down farther in the process so I will keep you posted. The number (for complaints) posted online is not the correct telephone number- for Las Vegas call 229-6444 (OPTION 2), for North Las Vegas call 633-1390, and Henderson call 267-4970.   \\n\\nTaken from www.accessclarkcounty.com\\nNoisy animals are misdemeanor violations which if witnessed by an Animal Control Officer may result in the issuance of a citation and criminal prosecution of the owner. Should an Animal Control Officer issue a citation for a noisy animal the complainant\\'s name will be listed on the citation as the affected party and you will be required to testify in court to the habitual nature of the noise. This is also why we suggest that you speak to these parties and try to work together as neighbors before filing a noisy animal complaint. We would suggest that you try to resolve this with your neighbors. It is only with your cooperation a case ca', 'actual_label': 2, 'predicted_label': 2}, {'text': 'n go forward towards resolution.\\n \\nIf Animal Control is unable to witness the violation the complaint will be forwarded to the Neighborhood Justice Center for mediation. Should mediation fail to resolve the problem you will be provided with a District Attorney\\'s packet. In most cases a letter is sent by the District Attorney\\'s Office prior to filing a Criminal Complaint to bring this matter into court. This process also requires the corroboration of two neighbors to process the Criminal Complaint.\\nWe get our Fish Oil capsules from this store- there\\'s always a coupon in the circulars, for $7.99 per bottle. It\\'s a small store but everything is relatively easy to find- the racks are filled and labeled with signs. \\n\\nI was surprised to find a section on natural products (it\\'s funny how much you tune out when you don\\'t have any interest). Since I was looking for a natural alternative to antiperspirant, I was rather impressed. I first checked out Whole Foods and some of the prices were pretty\\n high. The prices here aren\\'t as steep. It\\'s nice to know that I can get some natural products here and it won\\'t be astronomical. I am slowly making the switch to use less chemicals.\\n\\nMy husband asked about some supplements and the sales lady gave her suggestions to him. Of course, she asked if he wanted to join their program, but he declined. As I said before, we usually just get our fish oil capsules from here. There are a lot of locations (like the Meadows & Premium).\\nThis is an amazing park- the best for kids hands down, but it\\'s way the hell out there (from us anyway). We came here for a unisex baby shower/BBQ picnic. In the distance, we saw a wedding being set up, with rows of chairs and ribbon decorations- nice! The grounds were lush green and vast. It was a fairly large group and they arranged for a tent rental. It\\'s first come, first served, for the large crowd BBQ area, so the younger brother camped out at 6 am! It was nice weather- sunny and bright, warm, but not hot. There \\nwas a lot of good food, there were games, and of course, opening the gifts and seeing the cute little clothes for their little baby girl. It was a lot of fun. There are numerous parking lots. Like I said, it\\'s a ways away for us. But all things considered, worth the trip. \\n\\nThe crowning glory of the park is the one specifically for children- there is a giant dinosaur, a water feature, and a playground- talk about fun for the kids! It overlooks a  waterfall going into a lake with lots of cute little ducks to enjoy seeing.\\nI came here years ago but just thought it was OK. This time, tried Happy Hour (Daily, BTW)- surprisingly very good. My husband said \"We have to come here again.\" The Happy Hour menu ($3/$4/$5) is available at the Bar but had booth seating in addition to the stools surrounding the bar. The alcohol ranges from $2-$5- 28 selections; beer, well, & cocktails.\\n\\nWe had the Fish Tacos (2)  with shoestring fries $5, Buffalo Chicken Sliders (3) with shoestring fries $5, and Crab\\n, Spinach, & Artichoke Dip (huge) with pico de gallo & tortilla chips $5. Everything was delicious. The fish tacos had chipotle ranch sauce, which was flavorful and zesty. The Buffalo Sliders (the server suggested this) had just the right amount of spice. The dip was huge and the spinach really gave it an extra touch. My husband thought the fries were better than \"In & Out\" - still don\\'t understand the fascination with that place, but that\\'s another conversation. Also, my husband had two beers. The bill? A little over $21.00. We didn\\'t finish everything. Great service, although very busy, still tended to us.\\n\\nThe server told us that people are surprised with the portion sizes- that they expect tapas sized plates, but the happy menu items are full sized here. My husband already knows what he wants to try next time.\\nMy sister and I went to the original venue held at the Fashion Show Mall parking lot, years ago- just wanted to show you how long I\\'ve known about it. We\\'ve gone a few times \\nin the larger location- it\\'s gotten huge (ie. packed crowd, so just a warning). The entrance fee has gone up, but you can get a four pack on www.lasvegashalfoff.com for $18. No outside food or coolers allowed. \\n\\nWhere else can you sample food from so many different restaurants at one time? It\\'s like a super food court outside (but way better! most food courts don\\'t impress me anymore, except Hawaii\\'s Ala Moana) with live music (MIx 94.1 FM artists) and events scheduled- except the prices range from $1-$5 for smaller portions. One year, I got a humongous slice of Key Lime Pie for $1.00. The weather is just right at this time of year. The park, located on the west side, is such a nice one, that you can enjoy the grounds. It\\'s a nice family thing to do. And the food choices are amazing. Make your rounds before deciding on what you really want or you\\'ll be sorry.\\n\\nWe used to go to the San Gennaro Italian Festival but it\\'s gotten pretty pricey for food and admission, that the whole thing co', 'actual_label': 2, 'predicted_label': 2}, {'text': 'st us about $50 and this was a five years ago. This one\\'s much better. Maybe, I can get my hubby to go this year. It\\'s been a while. Food coma time.\\nThe decor/ feeling is that it\\'s a bit older than most of the ones that have been renovated (kind of reminded me of the way the older Albertsons stores looked like). But the trade off is that the customer base is so much better, compared to our former frequented one. \\n\\n(I\\'m giving directions as if you\\'re walking through the front doors.) Shopping carts are to the right. Boar\\'s Head (the best meat, no fillers) at the Deli- to the far left. We overheard one customer inquiring about a Board Head sandwich catering order, that\\'s good to know! The Produce department is to the left, past the Deli, and the Bakery (against the wall and middle of the walkway) is just past the Produce department. The Health foods are up against the wall, past the Deli counter, in the Produce department. The meat department is past the Bakery department. \\n\\nFrozen secti\\non is in the middle of the aisles (in these aisles are: other foods, like bread, canned, sauces and packaged foods.) Right section (the direction of these aisles are situated opposite the first set of aisles) is household cleaning (like laundry detergent) and similar products. Front right section was designated for the Seasonal items, like the Easter candy (I\\'m sure it\\'s Summer stuff now). Far right (against the wall) is where the Pharmacy is located.\\n\\nWe got lucky one week day night as I spotted something we really needed for 75% off, it was a couple of foaming hand soap dispensers. Score!  \\n\\nLots of Giftcards- near the middle in between the aisles and the cashier counters (end cap); sometimes there are 2x gas points, or even 4x gas points. (TIP: Do the receipt surveys for 50 points). \\n\\nDon\\'t forget: Free Friday- download your coupon (online) for the promos every friday. \\n\\nHas a US Bank that is open 7 days a week (convenient)- this is to your right as you enter the store, along the wa\\nll. The manager is very nice. \\n\\nAs you exit, you will see the sign highlighting what National Day it is (pie, cake, etc.)\\n\\nIt\\'s clean, free of weirdos, and the people working here are pretty nice (the Pharmacy, the Deli and at checkout).\\nLocated in the Albertson\\'s shopping center, this small Great Clips\\' lobby is steadily filled and busy (with regulars). Not high maintenance. I have a hard time finding the right hairdresser for my super straight hard-to-curl Asian hair (my sister ended up with curly hair). \\n\\nEnter Danica- she really listens to what I want and delivers without missing a beat. I always ask for her or call ahead to see what her hours are, on the weekend. The last time I got a haircut, layers, was the best haircut in years. (I\\'m growing out my bangs.) I love the versatility- so many pretty styles for this layered cut. Hope that she\\'s around for years. \\n\\nThe basic haircut price is $11.99. Sometimes, there are coupons for $6.99 in the weekly circulars, about 4x a year. You w\\nalk in, give your name, you\\'re \"in line\", take a seat, wait your turn. If you need to refer to styles for inspiration, there are plenty of books to look at; if you want something to read, there are magazines galore.\\nI thought that this was just a small, but very brightly lit, candy shop endorsed by celebs like Kim Kardashian and Holly Madison, but when we went inside, we found out that it\\'s more than that. They also serve gelato, cupcakes (red velvet advertised outside- it\\'s intriguing as I am a red velvet cake fan), truffles, and reusable lollipops (the busty blonde explained to me the logistics- interesting, didn\\'t know that such a product existed- but I am not a lollipop fan...just saying- and she seemed to pop up around the corner with more info on their candy, haha). The price for the bulk candy is $12.99 per pound- which is about right, on average. \\n\\nThere were about five people working there- all smiling happy faces, ready to assist you with your candy needs. Seating outside (fe\\nw tables), so you can enjoy your sweet treats at a little table located just outside the store, in the middle of the aisle. We didn\\'t buy anything, as we already had a good dinner (at Bahama Breeze) and a house full of treats (Christmas gifts). Lots of candy for the candy lover. I had never been, but I still think that the It\\'s Sugar store at Universal Walk is wayyyy better.\\nWe went here this past Black Friday (set to open at 8 am), and the line almost wrapped around the building. We were in the area, and underestimated the demand for the Genesis system at $20.00- which is what my husband wanted. Apparently, coupons were passed out in line, and we must\\'ve missed that announcement in the newspaper ad (assuming it was printed). Come to think of it, I did notice an employee walking back towards the entrance to the store. This happened as I stood in line, while my husband found a parking space. We went inside, but found out that the system sold in seven minutes! There were so many people t', 'actual_label': 2, 'predicted_label': 2}, {'text': \"here- some other people got rude when they learned that the Genesis sold out. Most of the customers were at the Electronics department, just like us. \\n\\nWe went here to look at furniture last year, and the prices were pretty high. It's been our experience (and yes, it has been recent) that employees at furniture stores are similar to used car salesmen- almost like circling sharks- I just don't like to be constantly followed and harassed. I think that my FIL bought something here but had to return it, because it didn't work out inside his house. Heard that the outlet in North Las Vegas has better prices though the pieces might not be in perfect condition.\\nWeird return policy. I had a sweater to return (this was a gift), but the sweater went on sale, so I had a pretty low value (and without a receipt). I got something else though, since I already had the sweater and in another color too. I ended up adding $7 to the return/exchange (all done on a gift card- this is policy). Just a warning \\nfor other people who have returns.  \\n\\nNice addition to the store- Sephora!!!\\n\\nSmall, but nice Christmas section.\\nWe were the 2nd set of customers inside. No greeting whatsoever by the single female employee at the counter. (My husband commented negatively as we were exiting, and that's when she acknowledged our existence- she looked up, I think she was reading or something.)\\n\\nSure, I was just browsing, getting ideas. I wanted to check out the swim coverups. Found some at $59, priced cheaper than the Everything But Water store @ the Fashion Show, however, they were mostly polyester, and that's not what I want. I'm looking for cotton or light gauze types. A few cute prints. And they were about knee-length or calf-length, too. \\n\\nSaw some swim separates (the tops) for $49.99 a piece. Mostly bikinis (OK, I know as the name suggests), not many tankinis (I prefer tankinis, I'm a little conservative when it comes to showing skin). \\n\\nAlso has activewear, but seeing as this is a specialty shop, \\nprices are a little steep. Very cramped inside as the racks are jam-packed; very hard to navigate the stroller. Even if I didn't have the stroller, I'd feel a little claustrophobic, and I'm a petite woman.\\nWe went here a few weeks ago. There was a sale on socks and gloves or something, which was in the front, near the cash register. We browsed the ladies section- on the left side of the store; mens is on the right side of the store. Shoes are on the back right side of the store. The dressing rooms are on the right side in the middle. I remembered seeing fleece for women at $19.99. I saw many nice bright colors. We went back again, last night. I only saw one color that I liked- grasshopper (bright green). The jackets were the type you wear when you're skiing- puffy bubble jackets (I don't like snow, so we're safe here; and I probably have enough jackets now, anyway). This is an expensive brand, retail, so going here would save you $$$. The racks are jam-packed with clothing, and the sto\\nre is clean. I noticed that both times we were here, there were a couple employees on the floor.\\nIf you haven't already figured this out, I love ice cream. It's no secret. My husband loves chocolate, I love ice cream. I even have it in the winter months.\\n\\n Ben & Jerry's is known for using local sources and ingredients, which is commendable. The prices are a little higher- is it because it is a Strip location, could be?  It really is a treat. Wanna save money?

A warning: The cone that they give you for this particular promotion is pretty big, so have a light lunch or dinner or there's no way you will finish it. I had to throw mine away. Or share it with a loved one. \\n\\nI really like the oatmeal cookie (can't remember the exact name, sorry), coffee, coffee, buzz, buzz, and the triple layer coconut bar. All of those mentioned are equally yummy. My husband like\\ns the one cheesecake brownie. Ah, the whimsical names, the unique flavor combinations, it's an ice cream lover's heaven. This is decadent, so you're going to have to work out the following day, ok?

Tacos are topped with cilantro and onions with some lime on the side, and while they do not have a salsa/condiment bar, they do have three different salsas in squeeze bottles and escabeche veggies(Carrots and chiles in vinegar) I enjoyed all my tacos that I got that I had to get two more Tripas tacos...If you\\'re a fan of Tripas like I am, request them \"Bien Doradito\" if you like \\'em a little more crispier!\\nBonus also for having agua frescas made from scratch!\\n\\nLooking forward to returning to try other menu items.

The Matzo Ball Soup was very good, and my bagel was as I imagined-nicely toasted and chewy like a NY bagel. The Nova spread was pretty bomb too. The Potato Pancake was simple, straightforward, and delicious. Something in the flavor of the Knish was kinda foreign to me, and after 2-3 bites, I was done with that...At least I didn\\'t knock it before I tried it! Wifey also failed to read that the soup came with a bagel, so she chose a Cinnamon-Raisin Bagel with cinnamon-raisin cream cheese which we enjoyed.

Lately, my stylist has been AWOL, and I needed a cut pretty bad! I had to find a place and QUICK! I was kinda nervous though, because there have been times I walked out with my hair butchered, and even one time bald like Mr. Clean!(True story!), just out of desperation to get my hair did, and I didn\\'t want that to happen again...\\n\\nWarren P. had mentioned Hi-Rollers located on E Charleston and Maryland Parkway to me a while back, and since we were heading in that direction, I decided to check Hi-Rollers out. Next door to the Huntridge Pharmacy, Hi Rollers is definitely a hidden gem. Those who know about it know what to expect. I\\'ve been to Hi-Rollers on three occasions, and I\\'ve been more t\\nhan pleased each and every time. Love the vibe as you step inside, as if you went back in time to a shop of the 50s and 60\\'s, cool pieces from Martin\\'s personal collection and gifts decorate the walls(LOVE the Loteria cards and the Corona street sign which is Wifey\\'s maiden name and Martin\\'s last name!? Hmmmm...maybe they\\'re related???)\\n\\nThe foursome of Martin, Chris, Caynen, and Chops make up the team at Hi-Rollers, with Levi being the shop keeper sweeping up, and making sure all supplies stocked up and replenished at all times. Being in business since 2010, these guys have earned a great reputation of being some of the best barbers in the business and it shows with each and every haircut. These guys even got their own sense of style every Tuesday and Saturday which are \"Dapper Days\". Yeah, they\\'ve gotten a write up in the Las Vegas Weekly, and were seen on Counting Cars and Pawn Stars, but after all the publicity, these guys still remain down to earth which is huge. This is not your \\nusual \"turn and burn\" \"meet a  certain quota\" kind of establishment. These guys don\\'t watch the clock. Instead, they\\'re busy chatting up a storm among themselves and their clients just like you\\'d see in barber shop style movies which ALWAYS makes for a great time. Just know that if flicks like Blood In Blood Out, American Me, Rush Hour or Goodfellas are playing on the TV, your haircut/wait time will just take that much longer, but its all good. I\\'m sure if they had their own TV show it would be HILARIOUS! Like many say, its definitely worth the wait. Even the line out the door before they even open is proof. \\n\\nTheir hours are Tue.-Fri. 9 am-5 pm, and Sat. 9 am-4 pm(Closed Sunday, Monday and the first Tuesday of every month) and the best advice I can give you is get here early, and if you are #5 in line, you will have at least a 30 minute wait. (There are only four chairs, and four barbers) They do not take appointments or credit cards, so bring cash, grab a little bite to eat, and expe', 'actual_label': 3, 'predicted_label': 3}, {'text': 'ct to spend a good couple hours of your day here. Another important thing to remember is to know who came before you, and who came after you. You don\\'t pick numbers, just know your order. You may move up a bit quicker if someone has a certain barber they are waiting on. Haircuts start at $15 with fades starting at $19 and includes a warm cream/straight razor shave and a hot towel finish. This awesome experience is at least a minimum of 30-45 minutes and everyone I\\'ve seen walk out after being cut is totally satisfied. This is also your one stop shop for all your pomade needs to keep your wig tight where you can find top brands like Suavecito, Layrite, and Shiner Gold. Seriously some of the sweetest pompadours and side parts  I\\'ve seen.\\n\\nFellas, if you\\'re searching for a spot that cuts, blends, shaves, and fades like nobody\\'s business, you may want to check out Hi-Rollers.

The Entertainment Capital of the World, Sin City, 9th Island, call it what you want, but Las Vegas has been good to me. Almost 8 years ago, I left Wine Country after living there 9 years for a job opportunity with one of the world\\'s top Pastry Chefs. Where else would you get an hour long paid break with a hot meal and  perks within the company? To this day, I\\'m doing what I enjoy, and still with the same people, so job\\n wise, Las Vegas has been good to me.\\n\\nThe cost of living here has also been a plus. We have been able to purchase a home without drowning in finances. Our mortgage is less than what some people pay for rent, and we can still save up for a rainy day. No State tax??? HELLS YEAH! Financially,  Las Vegas has been good to me.\\n\\nAfter a near-death experience in Wine Country where a man\\'s life was taken in front of me, and mine was spared, I could only realize that it wasn\\'t my time to go, and that the big man upstairs had other plans for me. I really needed to re-evaluate my priorities in life, and FAST! We relocated to \"Sin City\" of all places, and who would\\'ve thought we would find an awesome place to worship on The Sabbath, also a day off that is VERY difficult to get in my profession, in Las Vegas???

Just the type she has ALWAYS wanted, a Pomeranian with a beautiful cream coat. We took him to the playpen and after wifey looked eye-to-eye with him for a good, long 10 seconds, he licked her nose with his little tongue and that was all it took.\\nA lady was eager for us to put him back and she was PISSED when that didn\\'t happen.

You got your choice of Celebrity Chef establishments, Local eateries, a gang of buffet choices, ethnic eats, and even the streets, if you ain\\'t scurred...you will never go hungry here because there is always something open, and Las Vegas (to me) is just a big circle, so I don\\'t really mind driving across town for something.\\n Its not as far as people make it out to be...\\n\\nLast, but certainly not least, YELP LAS VEGAS!!!! Because of Yelp, our kick-ass CM Misti, and her associates  Bobby Y., Terri K., Bentern, and J-Tern we\\'ve experienced a little bit of the \"Rockstar Lifestyle\" being HELLA spoiled at Elite events, seen a few shows, kicked it VIP style at the club, dined at great establishments, and forming great friendships along the way.

Overall, The City of Las Vegas has totally been good to me, and for those of you who constantly hate on Las Vegas, caught up in the drama, temptation, and sinful side and don\\'t like it here, Las Vegas didn\\'t put a gun to your head, you\\'re where you\\'re at by YOUR OWN ACTIONS!!! With every action, there is a reaction. Positive or Negative? The choice is yours....ALOHA!!!\\n\\nYELP 365 CHALLENGE-(280/365) \"What Happens in Vegas Ends Up On Yelp!\"\\nWe were in the area and I want\\ned to pick up a few items to duplicate Komol\\'s Herbal Salad.\\n\\nI also picked up a bottle of Estrella Damm Inedit, the Beer from the folks at El Bulli that went with the Lobster and Citrus course at e\\' by Jose Andres. Its also cool to see that I could also get items from home like Wailua Soda, Rare Hawaiian Honey(pricey, but worth every penny!) and even Bubbie\\'s Mochi Ice Cream.\\n\\nThe Cheese Selection here is pretty awesome here too. I always gotta get a wedge of one of my favorite cheeses, Sottocenere, a cheese LOADED with truffle goodness!\\n\\nYes, alot of things here are priced pretty steep, but on the other hand, you can\\'t find some items elsewhere....Still a big fan, and still coming back!....ALOHA!!!!\\n\\nYELP 365 CHALLENGE-(85/365) \"Whole Paycheck\"\\nJun\\'s is one of those many places that caters to Hawaiian transplants and is pretty decent for their Korean BBQ, just like home.\\n\\nYou can\\'t go wrong with Jun\\'s Special-Kalbi, Bugolgi, Meat Jun,BBQ Chicken and Mandoo. The option of Brown Rice i\\ns sweet too.\\n\\nThey\\'re also generous on their banchan selections and even serve Hawaiian Sun Drinks.\\n\\nIf you\\'re on this side of town, definitely give Jun\\'s a try...ALOHA!!!\\nThis venue is great for people who enjoy outdoor lawn type seating for an event. I\\'ve attended a food festival, Reggae in the Desert, and most recently the Jazz in the Park Series.\\n\\nThe coliseum-style seating is great too because everyone has a good view of the stage practically from any where you are seated, the grass is soft, and when the sun goes down, its pretty well lit.\\n\\nA bunch of us got together and did a potluck on the lawn while listening to the legendary Jazz artist Earl Klugh. This FREE event also allows you to bring low back lawn chairs, blankets, and even picnic items and alcohol at no additional charge...who else does that???\\n\\nFor all you Reggae music fans, Reggae in the Desert is just around the corner, but be warned that you may feel a little Irie at the end of the evening from concert goers who\\'ll b', 'actual_label': 3, 'predicted_label': 3}, {'text': 'ience from my last visit varied soo much.  Over the weekend, I wasn\\'t AS impressed with the service/food.\\n\\nFirst, I noticed that apps are being pushed.  That is absolutely fine as I\\'m in sales, I know they\\'re open to make money.  However, I felt as though I wasn\\'t sure if they understood that I didn\\'t want anything due to the slight language barrier.\\n\\nChicken Enchiladas - was alright, but came with $1 guac that I never ordered.  I didn\\'t say anything \\'cause 1) it\\'s $1 and 2) the portion was OK.  The side of Mexican rice wasn\\'t as fresh this time.  It was dry!  And instead of the $1 guac, I wished that I had gotten beans.\\n\\nSo SPELL OUT the sides that you want or else you may receive $1 guac!  Guac seemed to be from a mix, didn\\'t have that same green colour as when you make it from scratch.  It was alright, but I can make better.\\n\\nWhat I did enjoy from the enchiladas were the corn tortillas - loved the corn taste - and the seasoned chicken that was stuffed inside.\\n\\nMy bf had to veg burri\\nto which - to me sounded gross - but he liked it.  There were chunks of diced veg that was NOT from a frozen package.  His burrito also came with a $1 guac...that he never ordered.  \\n\\nWhen ordering, he did ask about whether or not he could get guacamole in his burrito, but when the waiter stated that there\\'ll be an extra charge, he declined it, but it was still brought to our table.\\n\\nI noticed that the tables/benches were dirtier this time with pieces of food/rice on the chairs.  Windows are also grimy so I think as a diner it would make me feel better if they were cleaned once in a while.\\n3.5-4*  Not much has changed since my last visit/review. \\n \\nMenu is small, but that\\'s not necessarily a bad thing.  (Great for the indecisive!)  If you\\'re getting a tofu stew, you get to choose your spice level.  You get 4 side dishes, everything is fresh & arrives bubblin\\' hot!\\n\\nI did notice upon this visit that it took quite some time for the sides to arrive.  And they arrived shortly prior to the \\nstews.  Another shortcoming is that service is inline with the prices.  Tea is rarely filled without prompting.\\n\\n***Main reason for my update:  If you order anything that is med spicy - spicy, basically anything that is red, your next pooh will be RED.  Do not panic, do not go to the hospital, your doctor, etc.  It will pass and should last only 1 movement.  \\n\\nI just remembered this, the hard way, and did slightly panic, especially since I was also suffering from the flu.  Remember the colour you eat will usually be reflected in your stool!***\\nHow come I have never been here before??  This is one of the better Portuguese bakeries in the city AND it\\'s pretty close to me! \\n\\n(It\\'s about a block away from T&T, at the old Golden Turtle plaza, tucked away in the corner.)\\n\\nThe bakery itself is pretty BIG with a large square counter in the middle (a side each for cakes/pastries, deli meats, olives, & cheeses), a hot table in the back corner, racks for bread/buns, another cheese fridge, a coffe\\ne bar, & a separate seating area.\\n\\nAfter choosing 1 slice, I asked the lady behind the counter for recommendations.  She said, \"Next time, get this (strawberry shortcake) and this (a chocolate covered eclair)!\"  I love it when workers are so passionate about their products that they go as far as to offer up suggestions.  :)\\n\\nWhat surprised me - and added *s - was the fact that pastries were pretty cheap.  (Shh...please don\\'t tell the owners I said that!)  For example, the 2 slices of Tiramisu/Caramel Cheesecake that I got were at least 2 portions AND $2.50ea.  Where in the world would you find those prices?\\n\\nExamples of other pricing includes:  Natas - $1.10, Donuts - $0.99, loaves of bread for $2-3 dollars.  The average price of the pastries/sweets were ~$2 for decently sized items.\\n\\nThe 2 cakes that I got, to-go, were not only fresh, but also not overly sweet!  I\\'ll definitely be back.\\nFood is maybe like a 3.5-4*?\\n\\nPumped up because the girl who was working was quite friendly!  Food \\nis not a 5* though.\\n\\nI got a trio of tacos for $11.99 and the fish was the best.  The other two - I can\\'t remember which, but they were meat-based - although were tasty lacked a bit more salt.  Portion was good enough for a light lunch.\\n\\nBf really liked his fish burrito - $10.99 and said they didn\\'t skimp on the ingredients like fish, guacamole, etc.  I think the burrito was better in value as I still had a bit of room after the 3 small-ish tacos.\\n\\nIf you can\\'t take the heat, there aren\\'t that many non-spicy options.  Even the 1 veg option, mushroom was spicy.  Both sauces that came with the complimentary nachos were spicy.\\n\\nPrices and quality of the food is GOOD!  They even make their own drinks (hibiscus, horchata, & tamarind) which I always look for.  I\\'d go back to try other flavours and maybe the burrito, if I were more hungry!\\n\\nPlace itself is quite casual - no washrooms? - and chairs were meant for short stints, a.k.a. very uncomfortable.\\nThis is more like a parkette really, but', 'actual_label': 4, 'predicted_label': 4}, {'text': ' although it\\'s across the street from Square One, it\\'s actually quite peaceful!  Again, it\\'s not that big, so I wouldn\\'t make a day of it or anything.  \\n\\nAs they didn\\'t seem that impressive when visited today, I was probably a week or two too late to see the sakuras in full bloom.  The blossoms are still on the trees, but it cannot be compared to what High Park would have.\\n\\nAnyway, it\\'s a cute place to retreat for a picnic, read a book, de-stress a bit, &/or take your engagement photos.  You\\'ll def need a permit though since it\\'s a small-ish & popular place for that!\\nI think I waited too long before my visit as I was sorta disappointed with the food.  Plus, I think the prices have gone up, quite a bit, since Union Social first opened and expanded.\\n\\nTip:  Visit a new restaurant shortly after it opens \\'cause staff/food should be on-point.\\n\\nOrdered:  Candied Salad ($11+$4 for BBQ Chicken), Short Rib Tacos ($8), Big Eye Tuna Sliders ($14), & a Pims & Ginger.  \\n\\nOur table got the Mediterran\\nean Dip ($7.99) for free as I told the waitress this was our first visit.  From the dips, the Sundried Tomato w/ Feta was the best, the others were just ok, including Hummus that tasted like one from Costco - not entirely a bad thing, but definitely not a freshly dip.  Black Olive tapenade was very salty and tasted like...black olives.  Dip came with some tri-coloured nachos and triangle slices of naan.  Knowing what I get for that price, I would never personally order this.\\n\\nI never tried the Candied Salad, but apparently it was ok.  +$4 was literally for 5-6 slivers of chicken. \\n\\nShort Rib Tacos ($8) - Barely any \"short ribs\" which was more like 2-3 slices of bulgogi meat.  This dish did have a kick from the chipotle mayo.  This Starter only came with 2 tacos.  More slaw than meat.\\n\\nBig Eye Tuna Sliders ($14) - The proportions were totally off on this one, bun was quite thick, soo much slaw, and a menial serving of tuna.  Carb central.  Dudes, I know fish is expensive, but it was lit\\nerally buried with this plating.  Honestly, I think it would\\'ve worked better as tacos, slightly smaller than Short Rib tortilla would\\'ve been ok, with longer pieces of fish.  No flavour on the fish which was a shame.  Slaw had a hint - just a small hint - of some kinda wasabi cream dressing.\\n\\nPims ($7) - Initially, I thought it was a \"good price\", especially in comparison to downtown counterparts, but honestly, it was WEAK.  I couldn\\'t even taste any alcohol in it.  It tasted like a berry ice tea.\\n\\nI brought my mom and she was not impressed.  She doesn\\'t like dining at \"White restaurants\" \\'cause she feels as though it\\'s terrible value.  And I\\'m afraid that Union Social was a good example of this small portion/higher prices thing.  Mains were ~$15.\\n\\nToo bad about the bad value because the waitress/staff were super nice!  Maybe a bit too over attentive, but very Stepford-nice.  Honestly though, I wouldn\\'t really go out of my way to visit a place with nice service, but just mediocre food\\n.\\n\\nAgain, too bad I didn\\'t visit Union Social before it became a victim of its own success!\\nYes, I did find a treasure.  However, I found this particular location very disorganised.  Location is quite large and ladies\\' blends into the men\\'s department, sections are broken up, re:  continues on the other side for 1-2 racks, but becomes another section, and it was quite messy!\\n\\nPurses were right in front of the windows and this is probably the worst section to put where everyone can see them.\\n\\nI was checked out by a manager on duty and she was quite rude to me saying something like, \"Don\\'t you know??!!\".  Maybe she was being a straight-shooter, but absolutely unnecessary.  Rest of staff appeared overworked.  Pricing is all over the place.  I\\'m guessing that this location is a bit mismanaged!\\nAttached to Winners, this is a mega HomeSense!  \\n\\nThe good thing about the size is that there is more selection and YES, more clearance items as well.  :)\\n\\nI love perusing through Winners/HomeSense\\'s\\n gourmet snack section and this place has a LARGE SELECTION.  Although they need to put some more chips in that section - as opposed to having them line the checkout.\\n\\nEven at the end of a Sunday night\\'s shopping day, the place was pretty clean.  There were staff members scattered throughout, near closing, tidying up specific sections.\\nTip:  24-hour Drive-Thru\\n\\nEven though this location is literally up the street from me, this was the first time I\\'ve set foot inside for Free Root Beer Day!\\n\\nRestaurant itself is quite small, parking is a bit tight, and enclosed, and could\\'ve used some cleaning.  Quite a bit of debris in the lot, so not a great first impression.\\n\\nThey ran out of frosted mugs for Free Root Beer Day, so the whole experience was lost on me.  Either they didn\\'t anticipate that many people would partake or they were just lazy and couldn\\'t be bothered to run the dishwasher.  \\n\\nThe counter near the garbage can was overflowing with empty trays, mugs, and other garbage which need', 'actual_label': 4, 'predicted_label': 4}, {'text': 'ed tossing out.  They seemed to be well-staffed, but there was no one delegating or taking initiative.  Even though there was a long line, there was only 1 of the 2 cash registers open.\\n\\nBeyond Meat Burger was somewhat pricey at $6.99 for the burger alone.   I scanned the menu and I couldn\\'t find a price for fries...on its own.\\nPretty good experience here!\\n\\nNOTE:  Similar system to Kenzo.  As soon as you walk in, write your name and # in your party down on the list!\\n\\nAtmosphere - Approx. a dozen table in 1 open area.  It\\'s quite noisy...even without music playing in the dining room.  Bustling on a Friday evening.  \\n\\nI believe you can make reservations as there was 1 large table open, where a group of people were eventually seated.\\n\\nArea - Sorta weird strip of Mississauga.  I think the owners were targeting International UTM Students from China...who drive as the campus is around the corner!  Not much else here at this strip plaza other than French Corner Bakery.\\n\\nPrices - Yes, it\\'s def\\ninitely NOT-$10 dishes here.  However, the portions, friendly service, and AYCE miso soup, rice, & shaved cabbage sorta make up for it.\\n\\nPortions - LARGE.  I could not finish the entire dish, however, a hungry-man could probably polish it off.\\n\\nQuality - At the front of the menu, the quality of the ingredients they use are emphasised.  They also use cod as their fish, so it\\'s not a cheap fish like basa.\\n\\nBetween The Original Vs. Terri Mayo, I enjoyed the Terri Mayo more.  The Original had a slightly cheesy flavour to it which I was not expecting.  \\n\\nService - Surprisingly friendly and efficient!\\n\\nMy only complaint is that the rice was pre-plated.  So it wasn\\'t hot and had a hard crust on it.  Also, since it\\'s AYCE on the sides, it\\'ll be difficult to flag a waitstaff down for a refill if it\\'s busy!  I did find that someone checked in on us 2-3Xs during our meal.  So they\\'re pretty attentive!\\nTIP:  FREE tea/coffee with Yelp check-in!\\n\\nXawaash has been \"bookmarked\" for a while, but it\\'s n\\nowhere near where I be (or where I wanna be UNLESS I\\'m flying out of YYZ), so I finally got here last night.  Maybe I should\\'ve gone earlier, when it was more poppin\\'.\\n\\nOn a Wednesday night, around 5-5:30pm, it was pretty dead.  No one in the large restaurant.  \\n\\nMaybe I was hungry/in a hurry, but the menu just looked like your typical shawarma / ME / Afghani restaurant.  I did a quick scan, but didn\\'t see any pastas or whatever else that sounded \"different\" from their online menu (re:  anjero, mutabbal, sabaayad).  So think:  kabobs, shawarma, kofta instead.\\n\\nPrices were also pretty comparable to say Watan Kabob.  It was $10+ for a salad/naan dinner platter and about an additional $2-3 for a protein with the rice/fries along with the salad/naan.  However, when I got home, portions were much smaller than any shawarma place that I\\'ve been to.  Although it came in a square styro, it was literally 1 flat layer of chicken shawarma and then a row of salad.  Mind you, I didn\\'t finish the who\\nle thing, but portions were still notably smaller than competition.\\n\\nTasted fine, sauces were very standard white/red.  Chicken probably wasn\\'t the best quality as it was a bit grisly and somewhat on the drier side.\\n\\nCustomer service was apathetic.  I stood in front of the counter for quite some time, staring at the menu, then standing right in front of the cash register before I was approached in a non-chalant manner.\\n\\nAll in all, food was decent, portions were on the small side, and it seems as though customer service isn\\'t their strong suit.  Nothing really worth driving into this \\'hood for...\\nThe atmosphere in the dining room looks nicer than most Chinese restaurants.  It\\'s slightly dated, but there are glimmering chandeliers everywhere, Persian printed broadloom, and nice curtains.  \\n\\nHaving said that, washrooms could be nicer.  Again, this is another Chinese place where warm/hot water in the restrooms is not even an option.  Only ice cold water flows out of faucet.  And certain s\\ntalls are used as storage spaces for cleaning supplies.  I really don\\'t like this.  It makes me question their cleanliness.\\n\\nFood-wise, there seems to be quite a large selection for dim sum.  Service was also nicer than most places and the staff tried to find out what dish someone in our group wanted, but didn\\'t know what it was called.  Initially, they brought the wrong dish, but didn\\'t make a fuss when we said that that wasn\\'t the dish.  They also took that extra step by taking out a binder, with coloured photos, in order to try to identify the particular item.  This gets them extra points!\\n\\nOur table ordered so much that we were given 10% discount.\\n\\nWould get more *s if the washrooms matched with the rest of the dining room.  Food is alright, I guess fancy dining room AND more selection tricks people into thinking that food is better than it actually is, but I find it just alright.\\n3.5*, but rounded up for friendlier-than-usual-Chinese places.  Food arrived quite FAAAST!  \\n\\nSince it', 'actual_label': 4, 'predicted_label': 4}, {'text': '\\'s essentially a fast food Chinese place, you will need to flag someone down.  So don\\'t expect service to be super attentive!  Our main waitress was friendly, the other 2 younger people looked like walking zombies, but I wasn\\'t offended.\\n\\nSince there was someone who was vegetarian in our group, we ordered:  Mushroom & 6-grain congee (\"healthier\"), Chinese doughnut stick, Mixed Veg Chow Mein, & Salt & Pepper Bean Curd (deep fried tofu cubes).  The weakest of the dishes was the deep fried tofu cubes that had the fried wok taste, BUT absolutely no seasoning - no S&P!  Everything else was pretty good, including the veg congee which I initially had reservations about.\\n\\nConstructive Criticism:  Chow Mein wasn\\'t crispy enough.  It was served on a platter with rounded edges to contain the sauce and since it wasn\\'t that crispy to begin with, how it was served made it even LESS crispy as time went on.\\n\\nFor 4-ppl, with some leftovers, it came out to just over $30, so pricing was good.  Although p\\nrices obviously depends on the dishes your order.  The Snow Pea Shots with some goji berries, so veg, was $15 a plate!  If you look through the menu, average price/family-style plate seemed to be around $15.\\n\\nI\\'d definitely go back, but maybe replace the Mixed Veg Chow Mein with reg Canto-style and S&P Tofu with fried piece of fish, squid/calamari, & those Fried Chilli Turnip Cakes!!!\\nCurrently undergoing some revitalisation.  Access to Lake ON was completely fenced off.\\n\\nHas potential to be picturesque, but definitely NOT during my visit.  Rose garden was non-existent. \\n\\nIf you\\'re planning to take some Wedding Pics, have your photog scope it out before trekking out to the site with your wedding party in tow.  You\\'ll need a permit anyway.\\n3.5*  I thought this place was OK for a takeout place.\\n\\nAtmosphere:  Space was not used to its full potential.  HUGE ass space in front of the takeout/cash area where there is absolutely no seating.  Instead, seating is concentrated towards front entr\\nance of restaurant.  Décor/furniture is sorta ugly, mishmash of random, leftover pieces, see:  photos.\\n\\nYES, you do get a complimentary handroll while you wait.  :)  I think we got Cali which is a very nice touch!  Food was well presented, but done so in takeout trays.  (I\\'m sure that they can make it into more of a restaurant if they wanted to!)  There was a self-serve tea carafe which I also appreciated.\\n\\nFood was good.  I wasn\\'t too fond of the sweet brown sauce which was atop the Green Dragon & Alaska Roll, but my bf liked it.  Everything was fresh, that\\'s for sure.  My least favourite thing was the Agedashi Tofu which was more like breaded, pressed tofu steaks.\\n\\nDecent, and I believe only, sushi place in The Junction area.  I wouldn\\'t hesitate to visit again if I was nearby!\\nConsidering that there was a brekkie special for $4.99, as pictured, it was fine.  Special only ran \\'til 10:30am and it consisted of 3 eggs (any way), 2 strips of bacon (no sausage option stated), toast (multi\\ngrain, white, dark/white rye), & a coupla slivers of fruit.  \\n\\nThe portion wasn\\'t overwhelming.  I\\'d say just right considering the price!  \\n\\nCoffee was $2.50.  Not sure if they offered refills, but the waiter did ask if we wanted more.\\n\\nOne thing I should mention was that hostess\\' face (young, Asian) looked like she had just eaten something rotten.  She had an attitude and was unhappy for some reason.  There were a bunch of people waiting to be seated and she eventually arrived and looked extremely displeased/pissed off.  As a patron, this was not the best impression to walk into.\\n\\nI *may have* decided to order something more $$$, but I was turned off with the reception of the hostess.\\nPrices - 1-2/5\\nCS - Pretty close to 5/5\\n\\nContrary to the name outside the store, this ain\\'t no Outlet.  Prices are retail, like $48 for a sports bra, $79.99 for sports pants, $110 Sam Smiths, etc.\\n\\nI was gonna write this place off completely, but one of their workers changed my mind!  He told me about t\\nhe promo going on (40% off red tagged items), went to look at the back when I asked him about a specific item, & actually brought an item that was somewhat similar to the item I asked for.  Very proactive, especially for a young person, & I appreciated that!\\n\\nBtw, they don\\'t sell Adilettes (just yet) or NMDs here at all.  Apparently, they\\'re \"too sick\" for this store!  ha ha\\nWeak in comparison to their original Oakville location.  The set-up here is terrible.  You hafta pick your items while standing outside the shop, then go back inside to ask questions/let the workers know what items you want.\\n\\nWorkers are not nearly as warm as the Oakville location.  Actually, they weren\\'t the friendliest when I visited.  I went shortly after they opened and there were no samples.  Oakville *always* has freshly sliced samples out on a cutting board which is great \\'cause sometimes you end up choosing something that you wouldn\\'t normally pick out.\\n\\nItems are NOT baked in-house, but rather brought in d', 'actual_label': 4, 'predicted_label': 4}, {'text': 'aily each morning.  Again, if it\\'s your first time here, do not judge the place based on this location!\\nTip:  If you\\'re having any reservations about this place, re:  locals who don\\'t live in the immediate Port Credit area, check this place out on Tuesday evening, i.e. Taco Tuesdays!  Where chicken tacos are only $2.  That\\'s right, $2!  :)\\n\\nAtmosphere was surprisingly hip for an area of the city that\\'s known to be primarily...senior.  It\\'s a mix of a sports bar/after hours bar/restaurant.  Tables + chairs are elevated and the lighting is also dimmer so you it doesn\\'t really feel like a regular sit-down.\\n\\nNow, onto the tacos...\\n\\nBeing $2 Chicken Taco night, I had to order those + the deal that was going on with the YELP-A ($12 for a tallboy + 2 tacos).\\n\\nI thought the chicken taco tasted good, meat was moist, and there was plenty of it!  Tortillas are made in-house and you can see that as they weren\\'t perfectly round.  The 2 sauce options on the table helped, especially the one that was \\nless-hot.  I really liked the taste better of this one better.  It made me feel as though I was back in Central America!\\n\\nOut of the all the other tacos, all options were ordered at the table with the exception of the vegetarian ones.  I ordered the fish ($8/2) and really liked the crunch!  \\n\\nThe consensus seems to be that the steak ones were the best, followed by fish, and chorizo.  Not saying that chorizo was bad, but that seemed to be the order. \\n\\nIf you\\'re looking for a place that\\'s playing the game, wanna soak in some suds, &/or in the mood for something other than burger/fries, check this local place out!\\n\\nP.S.  YELP-A was an easy drinking beer.  It might not be your kinda thing if you\\'re really into craft beer and have a more sophisticated palate - I sure don\\'t! - but remember, part of the proceeds go to charity to keep that in mind!\\n3.5*\\n\\nThe smaller, cheaper, ma \\'n pa version of Paramount.  And if that + having the same, fresh, puffed pitas isn\\'t enough of a comparison, Panora\\nma - also starting with a \\'P\\' - is located just up the street!\\n\\n(I read somewhere that the ex-manager of Paramount owns Panorama, but I cannot confirm this.  What I do know is that the concept is the same, minus the contemporary décor, hustle \\'n bustle, uniformed waitstaff, and baklava.  Minus a *.)\\n\\nThe \"Bakery\" in the title is somewhat misleading \\'cause aside from the pitas/manakeesh (\"pizzas\"), there aren\\'t any other baked goods.  Didn\\'t see any baklava \\'round.  :(\\n\\nThe Good:  Serving sizes are LARGER than Paramount.  Their Shish Tawouk (chicken kebab) chunks much bigger than those offered at Paramount.  Another bonus is that their prices are lower, eg. Paramount Chicken Shawarma Sandwich - $6.49 (+tax), Panorama - $4.99.\\n\\nThe Bad:  Not all waitstaff are fluent in English.  I asked what kinda drinks they had, i.e. non-pop, and the waitress suggested some \"ginger drink\" that she\\'s never tried before.  I was expecting something different, exotic, but was brought Schweppes.  My friend \\nasked for a mango drink and was brought an orange juice.\\n\\nTheir servers were also wearing street clothes which was off-putting.  Even though it\\'s a casual/family atmosphere, I think it would look more professional if they had a dress code.\\n3.5* - Based solely on getting a burrito takeout, customer service, AND the fact that I don\\'t want to see anymore small businesses fail at this particular unit!\\n\\nFood - Ordered a carnitas (pulled pork) burrito to-go.  I figured that that was the easiest thing to order on-the-go...as opposed to Baja Fish Tacos w/ a coupla sides which I was recommended.  Burrito came with a refried bean paste which was definitely NOT from a can.  \\n\\nI thought it was good.  Rice wasn\\'t as flavourful as Chipotle, but I do not personally know whether plain or lime/cilantro (Chipotle) is more authentic.  Would\\'ve tasted better if it was piping hot.  Temperature-wise, it could\\'ve been hotter.\\n\\nPortion vs. price - It was $7.85 (ex. tax) for a small burrito which was smaller t\\nhan Chipotle.  I was actually able to finish this one!  Chipotle\\'s burritos are +$1 and much larger.  Perhaps Border MX\\'s large is the same size?  It\\'s marginally cheaper.\\n\\nBurrito came with delicious, fried tortilla chips!  REALLY GOOD touch.  So while I was taking out my burrito from the paper bag, it was a surprising bonus to discover the chips!\\n\\nCustomer Service - Very nice, but since I was the only person in the restaurant at the time, all attention was on me.  Not fully comfortable, but young man was very nice.  English was not his first language, so I had to reiterate a coupla times for clarity, but it was fine.  Workers did speak Spanish, so that added to the \"authenticity\".\\n\\nAnother man came by while I was waiting for my food, asked if I was served, and offered me a glass of water.  I thought that was sweet.\\n\\nI would like to come back to try other items on their menu, so I hope that they stick around \\'cause the city is definitely lacking in authentic Mexican!\\nSince my last rev', 'actual_label': 4, 'predicted_label': 4}, {'text': 'iew, I\\'ve been back a handful of times and have had a chance to try a few more items from their bakery:\\n\\nNatas - Not too egg-y for those of you who don\\'t like that taste in custard.  Pastry was nice and crispy!  I believe they were $1.10ec\\n\\nStrawberry Shortcake/Chocolate Cake - Despite what one lady behind the counter said, Strawberry Shortcake wasn\\'t the best and neither was the Chocolate Cake.  More cocoa taste as opposed to rich chocolate\\n\\nStrawberry/Lemon Cheesecake - Pretty good and surprisingly light and not too sweet.  Apparently the Blueberry Cheesecake is the sweetest\\n\\nEclair - SKIP THIS!  Choux pastry was pretty dry which was a shame \\'cause the custard - similar to what\\'s inside a Boston Cream doughnut - was pretty fresh tasting.  Perhaps it\\'s just a matter of storing them properly, re:  not in a refrigerated showcase.  I have no clue as to how you even make these ahead of time and actually get them to taste good\\n\\nMeia de Leite (Portuguese latté) - Pretty good, definitely has\\n a different, more roasted taste than the traditional Starbucks/Tim Hortons/McD\\'s latté.\\n\\nI find the staff always very cheerful and patient which does create a nice atmosphere and returning customers!\\nI guess Passport Canada has really amalgamated as there are only 2 locations in Mississauga to get this done?  I was surprised too when I Googled it.  The other alternative on Glen Erin has paid parking, so I opted to go to this Central Parkway \"Mall\" instead.  ;)\\n\\n(It\\'s not really a mall, btw, but more of a neighbourhood plaza in the Valley.)\\n\\nThis Passport Office is newly renovated and is no longer upstairs in some dingy digs, but on the main level.  It\\'s pretty centrally located, so you can\\'t really park \"too far\" from it.  As soon as you step into the mall, there are clear signs pointing you in the right direction!\\n\\nIf you\\'ve filled out all the forms in properly, the process is pretty smooth.  You stand in one line for someone to quickly scan your app and give you a number.  Then you \\nhave a seat where you wait for your number to appear on the digital boards located throughout the room.  \\n\\nI went this afternoon and from the time I got my number - when I was served was approx. 20mins.  Not too bad.\\n\\nNote:  There is no free WiFi.\\nTIP:  Other than the OMVIC and licensing fee, there aren\\'t any dealership feels here!\\n\\nReview is for the salesperson I dealt with, Gary Singh.  (I promised that I\\'d write a review for him!)  I cannot speak for the other sales people, servicing, or support staff as I had zero/very little interaction with them during my purchasing process.\\n\\nFirst of all, this dealership is HUGE.  It covers about a block in length and Gary was proud to state that it was either the largest Honda OR car dealership in Canada!  It\\'s extremely high volume, so interpret that info whatever way you want!  \\n\\nIt\\'s not the fanciest dealership, but there is free wifi/coffee, seated waiting area with a tv, washrooms, etc.  Whatever you\\'d expect from a busy place like this.\\n\\n\\nOn the 2 occasions that I dealt with Gary, he was prompt, soft-spoken, & trustworthy.  Basically everything that you DO NOT expect in a car salesman, especially a used one!  He makes things happen, wants to sell you a car if you want one, and doesn\\'t play games or hardball.\\n\\nOn the other hand, I must mention that the Financing Manager, or whatever his title is of the person who\\'s supposed to sell extra coverage and have you sign all the paperwork, was unnecessary curt and I felt as though my presence was getting in the way of his long weekend.  Sure, we already agreed to purchase the car, but he was just going through the motions with absolutely zero pleasantries.  A vast contrast from my experience with the sales person.\\n\\nThrough my observation, I think every customer\\'s experience will really depend on WHO you get as a salesperson.  I think I lucked out in finding Mr. Singh.  He took the stress out of something that eventually becomes a chore.\\n\\nI\\'ll definitely update my review after m\\ny mom has picked up the car.\\nI personally haven\\'t been inside of this library, but it was recently renovated within the last coupla years in a mid-century modern style.  Complete with the MCM furniture to match and lotsa floor-to-ceiling windows!  Also lovely in the evening \\'cause it has an interesting lighting scheme with some linear LEDs bordering the building.\\n\\nIt\\'s a single floor, much smaller & quieter library, so if this is nearby, avoid the noisy Central Library.\\n\\nI\\'ve been meaning to visit here, take advantage of the free wifi, when the temps rise, and it\\'s not physically possible for me to study at home, but haven\\'t had the opportunity yet!  Maybe this Summer?\\nContrary to the last reviewer, I had absolutely no issues with this Chipotle location.  Chipotle is actually one of the few chains that I don\\'t mind dining at!  Of course, being located inside a food court, it isn\\'t optimal for \"dine in\", but the line moved pretty fast, assembly line workers were friendly and efficient, ', 'actual_label': 4, 'predicted_label': 4}, {'text': 'and no problem/delay proceeding through check-out.\\n\\nAfter the cash register, there are even stainless steal cutlery to pick up (if you choose), napkins, and 3 additional condiments to enhance your burrito/bowl/taco!\\n\\nAll items with your choice of brown/white rice, black/pinto, toppings were $8.95ea which is on par with other Mexican places.  You can also request extra corn or whatever else your heart desires!\\n\\nAside from LA/NY, I haven\\'t been to a Chipotle here, but in LA, the \"veg\" option actually comes with some kinda seasoned tofu/TVP as opposed to just omitting the protein...which I think is a bit of a gyp.  Although, I *think* you get free guac with the bowl as I wasn\\'t charged for it.\\n\\nEverything tasted fresh and I hate to say it, but it may have been even better than my usual place (El Sombrero).  :(  The downside is that you either hafta eat at Food Central or take it out!\\nNote:  This place is notably different than the 1 photographed in \\'10.  There is no adjacent parking lot a\\nttached to building, just street parking.  There is a lot nearby, but dunno if Olenka\\'s patrons can use it.  They may have moved since that photo was taken.\\n\\nThis may be an unfair review, because my sweet tooth extends primarily to pastries during that \"time of the month\".  Other than that, I rarely crave stuff like chocolate & ice cream.\\n\\nSweet Olenka\\'s was not really what I had expected as the focus seems to be on those 2 things that I rarely crave.  To the right of the entrance is a huge showcase just for chocolates and that was already a bit of a let down for me as I never shop at Laura Secord/Godiva.\\n\\nThe other large showcase was ice cream in these deep tubs.  According to the sweet Asian lady who served me, everything is homemade and ice cream is a big draw for customers.  She was very helpful and patient as I told her that this was my first visit.  \\n\\nThere were some baked goods, but they were limited to a coupla types of \"cakelettes\", cakepops, cupcakes, some macaroons, brownies\\n, & squares.  Again, majority of them were chocolate-based.  So after driving all the way there, I felt like I had to buy something...even though I normally wouldn\\'t eat any of it!\\n\\nI got a scoop of Ginger/Dark Chocolate ice cream and a chocolate-covered cookie dough ball on a stick, both were ~$3ea.  While both of them were good, they were also chocolate-based and the cookie dough was quite sweet.  Not sickeningly sweet, but sweet enough for me.\\n\\nAnother Con:  The interior itself is sorta old, dark, \\'n drab.  I was expecting something newer/European, but the seating/crepe area reminded me of an \\'80s non-chain coffee shop where old peeps meet up.  Really not inviting and prompts you to grab your stuff and go elsewhere to eat it!  Maybe if the inside was better, it would\\'ve improved my overall impression of the place. \\n\\nArea itself is sorta on a weird, seedy-ish/transitioning stretch of Lake Shore.\\nI\\'ll readily admit to calling this place \"Hospital Hotel\" et \"Hotel LaHell\" before I actu\\nally checked in, but I\\'m happy to report that I didn\\'t see any ghosts or experience near-hell...with the exception of seeing some homeless person put some kinda white pill on his palm.\\n\\nPROS\\n+  located on a small street, so it\\'s not stressful to unload car, park on the side\\n+  quiet\\n+  staff seemed sweet and professional, explained everything\\n+  room was clean, included a kitchenette which I\\'m sure would be useful for someone staying long-term\\n+  free local, outgoing calls\\n+  GOOD value, @ ~$100/night which includes continental breakfast!\\n+  great location!  A few blocks away from Vieux Montreal et a main drag, St. Catherine, St. Denis.  Most places downtown are very walkable\\n\\nCONS\\n-  somewhat sketchy street.  First impression was bum and weird people milling about hotel\\n-  driving into the underground parking lot was like going down a roller coaster.  Steep as hell and sharp turns abound!  Not sure what happens if another car happens to be comin\\' up, while you\\'re going down et vice-ve\\nrsa\\n-  underground parking is NOT connected to the hotel itself.  There\\'s a separate entrance/exit door.  No biggie.\\n-  noisy a/c/heating units.  Just turn the darn thing off!\\n-  there\\'s wifi, but it\\'s non-existent the further away you are from the lobby.  Took forever to open a page, just gave up, and ended going downstairs for stronger connection/use their computers which were off to the side of reception desk\\n-  even though I put the \"Do Not Disturb\" sign, my room was made up.  So you may hafta clarify this with hotel staff if you\\'re particular about not having your stuff disturbed/thrown out\\n\\nOnce you get over the odd druggie/homeless person, it\\'s all good!  Saw lotsa families staying here.\\n\\nTip:  I *think* one of the outdoor lots nearby is theirs.  So you may want to ask if there\\'s an option of parking there instead of their questionable underground!\\nI dunno if it was the time of day that I visited, re:  Sunday afternoon, or other factors, but this place was d-e-a-d, DEAD!  Was ev', 'actual_label': 4, 'predicted_label': 4}, {'text': 'eryone at church, visiting their friends at convalescent homes, attending a funeral, or just literally deceased?\\n\\nEveryone who was there was either old &/or White, or random young, immigrant families.  Perhaps this place is busier during the school year with Sheridan nearby.  Definitely NOT a place for the hipster crowd, that\\'s for sure!\\n\\nScanning the directory, there really isn\\'t anything here that I\\'d make the special trip out for.  Well, there was StyleSense, but some dumb-dumb decided to shut that down.\\n\\nIn any event, the lady at Guest Services was awfully nice.\\n***Review is based on takeout coffee/cannoli and whatever service that was required.***\\n\\nI was in between showings and absolutely STARVING, so I decided to check out what bakery was nearby and Maraschino fit the bill!  \\n\\n(It wasn\\'t ultra-close, but there weren\\'t that many listings for bakeries in the area.)\\n\\nA 12oz coffee was $1.50 - the man behind the counter made a fresh pot - but it came out of a package.  That\\'s fine, t\\nasted ok.  So it\\'s not a coffee connoisseur\\'s paradise.  Had some time, so I also grabbed a small cannolo which was $2.  That was good too and tasted fresh with an actual ricotta - or at least a mix - filling.\\n\\nJust as I was finishing, the man who served me brought out a homemade pizza and pasta to a neighbouring table.  It smelt really GOOD!  \\n\\nIt\\'s a shame that I wasn\\'t able to order actual food though \\'cause it did smell and look great.  Next time, Ajax!\\nDue to proximity and the fact that they\\'re both new-ish bbt places in the city, a comparison between GG + Chatime are inevitable, so here are some differences:\\n\\n-  Interior is way nicer than Chatime.  A bit more upscale, music is more chill, and not blasting.  Is that a sign of old age?  Ha ha! \\n\\n-  Unlike Chatime, there was not a line-up out the door either which is nice\\n\\n-  they served buttered popcorn as a mini-app of sorts, salt/crunch fix!\\n\\n-  Service is just as long.  While dining in, drink did take a while.  And my drink arri\\nved waaay later than my friend\\'s\\n\\n-  \\'Regular\\' size was just a slightly larger than normal-sized mug\\n\\n-  I ordered a Matcha Frothie Milk Tea ($5) w/ tapioca.  I found the matcha quite watered-down and definitely not that bright, lively green colour.  Maybe a coupla teaspoons of tapioca.  Chatime version was much better, stronger matcha flavour, and definitely more generous with their bubbles!\\n\\nConclusion:  For a nicer dining-in experience &/or if you\\'re doing work on a laptop, definitely choose GG over Chatime.  However, if you\\'re doing takeout, based on my drink alone, the drinks over at Chatime are probably better!\\nMaybe 2.5*\\n\\nI hate dim sum.  Ok, lemme clarify that, I hate dim sum in Mississauga and certain parts of TO.  Having said that, I have yet to experience dim sum in Markham/RH, proper!  \\n\\nI especially dislike it when non-Chinese friends suggest dim sum and I happen to be 1 of the few Chinese people at the table.  Inevitably, I\\'ll get annoying questions like, \"What\\'s good her\\ne?\" AND people ordering crap that I would never eat/\"big dishes\" that cost like $6...that I would never eat! \\n\\nHaving eaten dim sum in HK, it\\'s safe to say that the \\'ssaug is probably one of the worst places in GTA-west for our version of tapas!  (Oakville/Brampton is not even in the race!)  Dishes are most likely double-steamed/fried and in general, not as fresh as it could be.  And as to whether or not most places have an actual dim sum chef?  Who knows!\\n\\nSummit Garden is considered one of the better places in the city for ds and despite the crowd waiting outside, it\\'s pretty mediocre at best.  Setting is nicer, with white table cloths, waitstaff in uniforms, high ceiling, but take that away, and the food is just ok.  It\\'s edible, but I don\\'t really enjoy.\\nAccording to the barista, this location just north of Square One, opened up in September.  And I was glad to hear since this location is convenient and not jam packed like the location at Chapters!\\n\\nWith approx. 10 tables that acco\\nmmodate 2ppl + 1 long Harvest table for ppl working on laptops, the seating itself here is rather limited.\\n\\nService:  Workers here seem very friendly and genuinely nice.  I was very surprised when the lady who took my order actually made a SUGGESTION.  After numerous visits to SB, this was actually the first time that anyone has done this and it was greatly appreciated!  \\n\\nI ended up trying out a drink that I would never have ordered \\'cause I have never even heard of it - an Americano Misto. \\n\\nMy only complaint about this and many stand-alone Starbucks locations is that why are they all soo damn cold (physically)??  I think the answer lies in their floor-to-ceiling windows that surround half of the café walls.  Why can\\'t they just do windows wherein customers who are sitting down can still look out?  I was literally wearing my Canada Goose while typing away it was that cold!\\n\\nAnd the washrooms are even worse, absolutely no insulation whatsoever.  I felt as though I was pissing out icic', 'actual_label': 4, 'predicted_label': 4}, {'text': 'les!\\n\\nTip:  If you tend to get cold, sit in the middle of the café, away from either entrances.\\nI\\'d say 3.5*  \\n\\nOne Love has been on my bookmarks for many, many months, but I was just able to visit it yesterday.  It\\'s literally not even a block North of Bathurst Stn.  I was able to see the subway station from where I was sitting!\\n\\nPlease note, the cafe is primarily take-out.  So your food will be served in a plastic container, wrapped in wax paper, &/or come in a paper cup.  So don\\'t expect any frills.\\n\\nI should\\'ve taken a photo of the menu posted, but as per Bernie\\'s review, the prices were a tad higher than I\\'d expect for takeout.  1 - sm corn soup, 1 curry meal, & a ginger beer was ~$22.  I shared a meal, so it wasn\\'t bad considering that.  Curry meal was definitely MORE than 1 portion!  I believe rotis were ~$12ea.  And I think I saw that the ginger beer was $6...that\\'s A LOT of either love &/or ginger!  ;)\\n\\nCorn soup was really good!  Not too salty.  Ginger beer had a sting to it,\\n as expected, and was really refreshing!  Curried bean curd & lima beans were good too.  Ingredients looked really fresh, especially the avocado and the side salad that came with the meal.\\n\\nLadies who worked there seemed nice.  A coupla people who I assumed came in to chat, 1 sat down to eat, and seemed to know the people working there, so there is a nice community feel to the place.\\n\\nWould definitely stop by again if I was in the neighbourhood and wanted something homey...and vegetarian!\\nRant:  Any car owner knows that the emissions test is pure B.S.  It\\'s yet just another method for \"The Man\" to squeeze more of your hard earned dollars out of your wallet and into their grubby hands!\\n\\nAnyway, Laird Automative Services was a referral from my mechanic for a LICENSED place that performs this mandatory test if you\\'re driving a less-than-new car.  In the past few years, I\\'ve come here whenever the test is due.\\n\\nNote:  All licensed garages that perform emissions test should charge the SAME \\namount.  My total was $33 \\'n change, so don\\'t be tricked into places that charge $50 or whatever.\\n\\nFor my visit today, I had the day off and decided to get this naggy errand out of the way.  I called ahead of time to ask if I required an appointment and they said, \"No\".  When I arrived, they took my car in right away and the test took all of 10mins to perform.\\n\\nHabib was very informative, he knows the programs well, any loopholes, and even he admitted that this whole emissions thing is a scam:  There is absolutely no proof that passing this test = less pollution/emissions into the environment.  I appreciated his efficiency and candour!\\nKFC/Popeye\\'s made-to-order AND with an ethnic twist!\\n\\nI was in the area, had this place on bookmark, and PMS\\'g, so I thought that I\\'d drop by.  I wanted to order the Taiwanese Pork Sandwiches - which I think they serve at Momofuku for like $5/pc or something ridiculous - but skipped it as it did not come in a combo.\\n\\nSo instead, I ordered the Koo Koo Bur\\nger (think:  fresher, larger McChicken) Combo - $7.95, came with fries + drink.  The guy behind the counter suggested the Lemonade, so I got that as opposed to a Milky BBT.  I probably waited 10mins for my order.  Both items were piping hot!\\n\\nSince it was an in-between time, ~4pm, I saved the food for later and drank the Lemonade.  Drink was not particularly my fav with a fakey lemon taste which reminded me of dish soap, but it was not overly sugary which was good.  There were some clear jellies at the bottom and it was quite refreshing.  Personally, I don\\'t like fakey citrusy drinks, so I probably wouldn\\'t order this one again.\\n\\nAte the burger a coupla hours later and it was still GOOD.  Despite being fried, the chicken itself is still moist which is contrary to those chain-fried chicken places.\\n\\nAnyway, if you\\'re in the mood for fried chicken, I\\'d definitely opt for this place before I even think of KFC/Popeye\\'s.  Again, since everything is made-to-order, it does take time to prepare\\n, so don\\'t expect McSpeed. \\n\\nMaybe it\\'s a good thing that it\\'s not in my \\'hood??\\nAtmosphere/service are NOT the reasons to check out The Golden Pheasant!  As it lacks on both fronts.\\n\\nLocation:  Technically, I think this place is in Lakeview, west of Port Credit.  It\\'s close to the infamous Dairy Cream.\\n\\nAtmosphere:  As per the other reviews, it\\'s like a mix between hall / neighbourhood dive bar / legion.  When I arrived tonight, my group sat away from the door, near the bar, and it was FREEZING.  I had to put my coat on my lap \\'cause there was a draught!  The only thing I can think of is that the heat was not on. \\n\\nThere was still daylight out, but interior light seemed to be from 3 torchieres and the bar area.  Fluorescent lights were not on.\\n\\nThere were a coupla drunk-ish, but harmless men just drinking at the bar.\\n\\nService:  Could\\'ve been friendlier.  The younger female server had an apathetic attitude.  Me & my party agreed that it looked like she hated her job!\\n\\nFood:  Weiner Sch', 'actual_label': 4, 'predicted_label': 4}, {'text': 'nitzel was pretty good, not super thin, and definitely not greasy.  Definitely HUGE portion as per all the reviews/photos.  I think a normal sized female could eat about 1/4 - 1/2 of the entire piece of meat. \\n\\nPotato Salad, which is supposed to be \"amazing\" tasted very, very similar to the Red Potato Salad available at Costco.  So although it was good, I was not blown away.  \\n\\nPrice:  It was $20 for half a portion of schnitzel + a Czech beer.  If you don\\'t drink, it\\'s like $11-12.  So definitely a decent portion:value.  Waitress gave herself 10% tip automatically on the bill.  It did make me not hafta do math, but not sure how I felt about this.\\n\\nIt\\'s a shame that the atmosphere/service was not more welcoming \\'cause I\\'m pretty sure that it would be more popular!!!\\nI\\'ve officially reduced my 2*s, to only 1*. \\n\\nYes, Guest Services did \"reach out\" to me as per their response at the bottom of my original review.  I even took the extra step of emailing them with my concerns.  However, week\\ns later, I have yet to receive a response.\\n\\nTheir \"reach out\" just seems like trying to save face / look like they care.  Completely disingenuous!\\nFood is more like a 3.5.\\n\\nMexicana Sandwich (sans nacho chips) was pretty good, a touch spicy from the mayo.  The \"special\" sandwiches features a breaded chicken breast while the Classic Chicken Sandwich (the cheaper one) contains a chicken patty. 3.5-4/5  \\n\\nHoney Biscuit was very good, similar to a donut.  Manager offered me & my friend a free one as it was our first visit!  It was very sweet of her. 5/5 \\n\\nOnion Rings - Batter was too thick, but it was crispy!  Maybe a 2.5/5\\n\\nColeslaw - Gross.  They put lettuce in it and it gives it an \"old\" taste to it.  Not zippy like coleslaw is supposed to be.  We added it on top of our sandwiches.  1/5\\n\\nRestaurant itself is mainly for take-out/quick dine-in.  It\\'s pretty small with 4 tables and a small counter.\\n\\nIf I was in the area, I may stop by once/year type thing.\\nSlightly less than 3* \\'cause I wa\\nited like 10-15mins for a regular Chicken Biryani.  Don\\'t they just scoop rice and plop a coupla pieces of chicken in a styro container??\\n\\nNote:  Take-out ONLY!  Adjacent to Rona, this place is literally a counter, with some snacks, and a cash register on it.  With the exception of a coupla benches & chairs, there is no seating whatsoever.\\n\\nYes, prices are cheap.  A regular, i.e. \"with bone\", Chicken Biryani was $5.50, including tax.  Boneless/lamb/shrimp was more expensive, $6.99, before taxes.  Biryani was one of the better ones that I\\'ve had, even raita was good.\\n\\nHowever, service is sloooow.  I stood in front of the cash for a few minutes before my order was taken.  (There was a girl grabbing some snacks out of the showcase, but she never acknowledged me.)  Actually getting the biryani was even slower.  Amongst the noisy workers in the back, I thought I heard one worker exclaim, \"There wasn\\'t fresh rice!!\", so I\\'m assuming that they had to cook more.\\n\\nLady who took my order never s\\naid anything to me about the food coming soon.  \\n\\nIf I was in the area, very unlikely that I\\'d be deep in Brampton, and I was craving biryani, I wouldn\\'t rule this out.  Having said that, I wouldn\\'t drive out of my way either!\\nI discovered Niki, a seamstress/dressmaker (a dying art!!!) through Yelp AND she lives down the street from me.  BONUS!  \\n\\nAside from the 1 shining review what really prompted me to pick up the phone was that she had a Facebook page and updated it with thoughts that came up during her work, re:  body image, meeting a deadline, pics of projects that she has completed, & other stuff that legitimised her business.  \\n\\nEntrepreneurs take note:  Social media DOES work!\\n\\nI had a pair of vintage, Aquascutum, houndstooth wool pants that were waaay too high cut, a bit tight on the waist, and too wide on the hips.  Re:  The fit was just off.  So I needed expert opinion on whether or not it was worth it to get them fixed.\\n\\nI called Niki, made an appointment for the next day,\\n and she spent A LOT of time with me, explaining what had to be done, and we agreed on the cost.  It wasn\\'t too-too bad.  The results will obviously speak for themselves.\\n\\nMy grandfather was a master tailor, my mom made my clothes growing up/does alterations, and my sister went to Ryerson Fashion School.  So needless to say, my expectations are quite high!  Too bad my mom/sis no longer have time to play in my closet of \"projects\". :(((\\n\\nI pick up my pants in a coupla weeks and will write a follow-up at that time!  CAN\\'T WAIT.\\nThe name of this place is deceiving as \"bakery\" is a small part of their business.  As you walk in, you see a menu for the hot table and their pizzas displayed behind the glass.  \"Bakery\" comprised of some buns, loaves of bread, and a table of tarts.  You can also buy fresh pizza dough, deli meats/cheese, and olives.\\n\\nNot knowing how much a slice costs, we picked out 3 different kinds: 1 w/ roasted red pepper/deli meats, 1 potato, 1 veggie.

Since that first visit, we've been here a couple more times.  It's in a shopping center just off Mayo & Scottsdale Rd....for some reason, this shopping center doesn't do very well, places close down frequently.  We're happy that this hasn't. \\n\\nHere are some items we've had here:\\n\\nMexican Bean Dip, $4.99\\n\\nSpinach Con Queso, $5.99 \\n\\nNachos, $8.99\\n \\nOwner's Chimichanga (Shredded Chicken, Black Beans, Cheese, Rice, Pico de Gallo Charrio Sauce w/Jalapeno Cream Sauce and Green Chili Sauce, Sliced Poblano Peppers, Cheese, Shredded Lettuce and Sour Cream), $13.99 \\n\\nUltimate Chimichanga (Roasted Pork, Rice, Pinto Beans, Cheese, Green Chili Sauce and Pico de Gallo), $15.99\\n\\nThe food is very good.  My fav's are the Nachos & the Ultimate and Owner Chimichangas.  The Bean Dip and Spinach con Queso are very good too, but if you get those don't get a large entree like the Chimichangas because it's too much food.\\n\\nThe servers are friend\\nly.  The restaurant can get packed during happy hour and peak dinner hours.\\n\\nOverall, it's a nice neighborhood family restaurant.\\n\\nReturn Factor - 80%\\nNeeded some household items, so I stopped by this location since it's nearby.  The store is organized like your typical Walgreens, very predictable location for items......so it made for an easy in/out.\\n\\nFriendly cashier was a bonus.\\n\\nReturn Factor - 80%\\nDecent gas station.  Wide lanes, convenience store, easy access....what more can I ask for?\\n\\nReturn Factor - 75%\\nAnother baseball season has passed for the Dbacks and we were lucky enough to get to a few ballgames this Summer.  Since we moved here in 2011, we look forward to Spring Training and the regular baseball season.  The Dbacks are usually competitive, but not this season.\\n\\nThe reason they get a bump up in stars since my last review is because the team is a class act and despite a bad year has the team going in the right direction.  They're also very fan friendly and put on some g\\nreat game day promotions.  My favorite is bring your dog to the game day....it's fun to watch all of the dogs in the ballpark.\\n\\nThe food at Chase field is good too.  Overall, it's an awesome experience for sports fans.\\n\\nReturn Factor - 100%\\nThis is a non-traditional Catholic Church that our family will go to from time to time if we are unable to attend our regular parish.  It's very different than what we're accustomed to...so we don't come here very often.  It takes some getting use to and requires an open mind to adjust to the differences.  We always feel welcome here and that's what counts.\\n\\nReturn Factor - 50%\\nA friend of mine invited me to play with him and some friends a few weeks ago.  I couldn't pass up the opportunity and made some time for golf.  For $47 per person, this was a great value.\\n\\nThe greens and fairways were in good condition and they didn't cram a lot of people onto the golf course, so the pace of play was just right.  There are some great views of Phoenix on cert\\nain holes.\\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/n812L7Mz4104bQ5Goo7yQg?select=3xxxtMpGNa92_YOiw_iiYA\\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/n812L7Mz4104bQ5Goo7yQg?select=yfSunO5v545PZhuraFLbFg\\n\\nThere's a menu board at the 9th hole tee box to order food to be ready at the turn, which is a huge convenience.\\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/n812L7Mz4104bQ5Goo7yQg?select=s7_UPH3z_4TCSMB8xSBEyg\\nAnother plus is that the beverage cart comes around often....:)\\n\\nFor the average golfer, this is a fun track.  Not sure it's challenging enough for the low handicap golfer.  Since I'm just an average golfer, I found it to be a good time.  The only knock is the location.....in the old Southern part of Phoenix near Baseline & 7th St.\\n\\nReturn Factor - 75%\\nI pop into this station for gas from time to time.  It's convenient for me when I visit clients in the area for lunch.  The lines for gas can get long here though and the lanes aren't too wide, so I don't suggest filling up during peak hours.\\n\\nThere's a Smoke Shop & C\\nonvenience Store available at this station, so you can kill several birds with one stone if that's your deal.\\n\\nReturn Factor - 70%\\nOnce upon a time I use to come to this place to meet friends for late night drinks and to hang out.  That was a long time ago, when it first opened.  Now, I only stop by when I take one of the cars in for servicing next door at Ted Wien auto service, which was the case during my most recent visit.\\n\\nIt's a nice place to hang out and have a few drinks while you kill time.  There are video poker machines on the bar, but since I don't gamble I hung out at one of the tables near the bar and surfed the web on my iPad.\\n\\nThe bartenders were very friendly and bored.....they'd talk to a rock if they could, so you should have some nice company too.\\n\\nOverall, it's a pretty cool neighborhood bar.  They serve food, but I wasn't hungry the day I was there, so no food this trip.\\n\\nReturn Factor - 50%\\nTarget is our go to place to get decent household items.  A definite stop \", 'actual_label': 5, 'predicted_label': 5}, {'text': \"during Christmas season, it's also a good place to find gifts for co-workers and friends....when you don't want to spend too much money.  The only thing about this Target is that it's tucked in the back near a TJ Maxx and Ross, which means the parking lot can get crazy when it's busy.\\n\\nOverall, it's a nice, clean store.\\n\\nReturn Factor - 80%\\nI shop at this Ross when I need to find a quick gift for someone.  It seems to have a nicer selection in their housewares section than most of their stores in Vegas.....so, when I'm in a pinch and need a gift, I stop here.\\n\\nThe store is relatively clean compared to some of the other ones in town.  It does get very busy though and the lines can be atrocious.  Not much else to say about the store....it's a Ross.\\n\\nWill I come back?  Chances are good.\\nMet a colleague here for lunch the other day.  It was my first visit to Frank & Fina's.  I arrived early and was seated promptly by the hostess.  While I was browsing the menu, the owner Frank came out wit\\nh Chips & Salsa and asked for my drink order suggesting a Margarita or Beer....hmmm, ok!  You don't have to ask me twice in a Mexican Restaurant if I want a Margi or Beer.  I ordered a Pacifico....what the hell, I don't have to go into an office and my afternoon was clear.\\n\\nWhile I waited for my friend, I decided I'd order the Nachos.  He arrived a few minutes later saw my Pacifico and ordered one for himself....I love how contagious Beer in a Mexican Restaurant can be!  We ordered our lunch and I like how the waitress asked me if wanted Jalapenos on my Nachos....I asked her if they could cut it fresh and put a lot on top...she said yes.\\n\\nWe had a nice conversation while we waited for our food, which came out a short time after we ordered.  The place was packed for lunch and I expected the service to be much slower, but it wasn't.\\n\\nThe Nachos were very good.  The proportion of Cheese, Guacamole, and Sour Cream were just right.  The proportion of Salsa and Onions were good too, relative\\n to the amount of Chips.  The portion was on the Appetizer menu and it could easily feed two or three.  It's not a huge pile of Nachos like you find in some restaurants. For $5.50, it's not bad.  The flavor of all the ingredients were very good too.  The only complaint I have is that the Chips are too thin....they broke easily with the slightest amount of pressure....which forced me to eat most of the Nachos with a Fork.  That's sacrilegious to some Nachos aficionados...LOL\\n\\nWe had another Pacifico and continued our conversation for a while after lunch.  It was a pleasant experience.  As a bonus, I ran into two friends I haven't seen in 8 yrs who were sitting a the table next to us.\\n\\nOverall it was a good time.\\n\\nWill I return?  Of course!\\nMy neighborhood Walgreens.  I can always count on this place when I need to buy random stuff around the house or meds when we get sick.  Since it's located on the corner of busy streets, it gets really packed at times.  The parking lot is not very big\\n and sometimes you have to park near Chipotle or AJ's.\\n\\nIt's organized like your typical Walgreens and offers a drive thru pharmacy.\\n\\nReturn Factor - 80%\\nWe discovered this place thanks to Groupon.  I bought 3 Groupons and then I kept seeing this pop up and I kept buying more....so, we've been here quite a bit over the past year.  We love this place because the food is good, servers are friendly, and when the weather is nice the outdoor patio is a perfect place to enjoy a meal.

What makes their Bruschetta unique is the tiny slivers of Proscuitto they mix in with the Capers, Onions, Garlic, Tomatoes, and Basi.  It gives it a slightly salty flavor that goes well with the sweet Tomatoes.  The Pizza dough they use is really soft/fluffy and in my opinion is very addictive.  The portion size of the Pizza is just right for one person with a big appetite, which is me.\\n\\nOverall, it\\'s a nice place to have dinner.  We\\'ll definitely be back.\\n\\nReturn Factor - 95%\\nWhen I\\'m in a rush to grab a bite to eat, McDonald\\'s is always on my radar.  I can always count on fast service to get my meal on the run.  This location happened to be nearby so I went to the drive thr\\nough and ordered 2 Double Cheeseburgers, $2.60.  I timed it, 3 minutes total from ordering to receiving the food and driving away.  This was during a busy lunch hour with 4 people ahead of me....talk about fast!\\n\\nThe Double Cheeseburgers were OK....it\\'s McDonald\\'s....you don\\'t expect superior quality....but I do expect fast, accurate service and a consistent product....which is what I experienced.\\n\\nReturn Factor - 70%\\nMet some friends here for drinks and to hang out for a bit.  The joint is tucked away on the 2nd floor of Harrah\\'s in the back near the entrance to the Monorail.  It\\'s too small to be a club.....about 1/2 the size of Gilley\\'s.  \\n\\nThe food here is OK bar food.  Our friends ordered some Wings and I sampled a few....they weren\\'t bad, just OK.  Same goes for the Fries.  Since I didn\\'t pay, I didn\\'t catch the price.\\n\\nThe waitresses are supposed to be cute/hot....but only 1/2 of them were.  The others looked a little \"sloppy\".  I hate saying that, but if you\\'re going to put you\\nr staff in sexy outfits, I\\'d make sure they are able to meet high standards....especially in Vegas.\\n\\nOverall, the food/experience was just OK.  The best part is the music.  The joint feels very \\'touristy\\'.  I\\'d give it another chance under the right circumstances.\\n\\nReturn Factor - 50%\\nCame here with my Son to look for a replacement charging cable for his iPod Touch.  It\\'s been a while since I\\'ve been here and there were a lot of changes!\\n\\nThey renovated the entire store.....it\\'s much cleaner and well organized with sampling stations everywhere so that you can mess around with some of the electronics.  They have a huge \"Magnolia\" room which is their premium brand area.  I wasn\\'t here to buy a big ticket item, but browsed anyway.  I saw the new MacBook Air, damn it\\'s really thin!  (see pics)\\n\\nMy Son found what he was looking for.....a cable and a wall charger, for $20, not bad!  At the Apple Store that would have cost $59.99 I\\'m sure.\\n\\nOverall, great shopping experience.  I like the new \\nlook.\\n\\nWill I return?  You bet.\\nOver the years, I\\'ve attended many conferences here.....ASD, MAGIC, CES, and many more I can\\'t count.  The convention center was originally a free standing building next to the old Sands.  When they built the Venetian and Palazzo, they built it around this old building.....the key here is \\'old\\'.\\n\\nThat said, to get to the main floor from either resort it\\'s a pretty long walk.  The easiest way to access it is via taxi or limo that drops you off at the steps....but I rarely take taxis in Vegas.\\n\\nThere\\'s no free internet access, so you\\'ll either have to pay an arm and a leg or bring your own WiFi.  Good thing I have an iPad with a cellular plan....it\\'s worth the cost....especially since I attend so many conferences.\\n\\nRestrooms are old and located on the level below the main floor.  The Las Vegas Convention Center is the same way, but their restrooms are more modern and large.  Oftentimes, this place has a long line waiting to use them because of the volume o\\nf people.\\n\\nBecause they\\'re trying to drive you to one of the casino properties, there\\'s not much F&B options at the convention center.  The walk is long to get any decent food options.  Also, there\\'s very few places to sit down and take a break from time to time....that\\'s probably my biggest complaint about this place.  When you\\'re on your feet for hours, you need to give show attendees places to rest.\\n\\nCompared to meeting space in other cities, this place rocks.  However, compared to places in Vegas...it\\'s just OK.\\n\\nReturn Factor - 100%.....because I have to.\\nHad breakfast today with some friends.  We sat in Crystal\\'s section.  She\\'s a great server....she was very attentive and ensures that you\\'re well taken care of.  It was a business breakfast, so she allowed us private time to handle business and when we were ready for food, she came by to take our order.\\n\\nI ordered the Belgian Waffles this morning.  The waffle was very good....not under/over cooked like I experience at some restau', 'actual_label': 5, 'predicted_label': 5}, {'text': \"rants.\\n\\nMy favorite part about this place is that it's a throwback....not only in decor, but in service.  Everyone there is friendly and works hard to ensure your meal goes well.\\n\\nWill I return?  You bet!\\nAfter all these years, this place is still the best place to make a sports bet in Vegas.  It's still the world's largest sports book and they continue to deliver the most complete set of proposition bets for the Super Bowl in the city of Las Vegas.\\n\\nEvery year, I look forward to the Super Bowl propositions coming out so that I can grab a copy and sift through the hundreds of options for betting.  Despite moving out of the State, I make a pilgrimage to Vegas to bet on the Super Bowl and this is my stop.\\n\\nSince I don't live here anymore, I don't hang out and watch games in the book, but they still have the giant screens and plenty of seating.  I send my friends here when they come to Vegas and want to bet sports.  Keep it up guys!\\n\\nReturn Factor - 90%\\nNeeded a car for a quick one day tr\\nip and found a deal on Expedia for $23 per day on a full-size car.  Everything went smooth from pickup to drop-off.  The customer service here was average....not top notch like some of the premium rental car companies...this is very middle of the road.  As long as they offer deals like this, we'll rent from this location again.\\n\\nReturn Factor - 70%\\nWhenever I need sports equipment or supplies, Sports Authority is my first choice.  I like the particular location because there's always plenty of parking.  This store is well organized and kept clean.\\n\\nReturn Factor - 100%\\nThis review is of their football stadium, which is modern and average size.  It's tucked away in the Southern part of the campus.  The walk to/from the parking lot is pretty far, and you might have to cut across some desert to create a shortcut.  I don't know why they just don't create a pathway through it.\\n\\nThe visitor's seating is larger than most visitors sections in other schools in the Valley.  The field is well kep\\nt.  Our son says it's one of the best kept fields he plays on.  The sound system and AV during the game is pretty good.  \\n\\nParking is tough....great parking spaces, but if it's a big game with a lot of people in attendance, plan to get stuck getting out of the lot.  It's like going to a Cardinals game....will take you a while to get out.  The nice facilities will bring us back.\\n\\nReturn Factor - 80%\\nOh Yogurtland.....why can't I resist your calling?\\n\\nI had to run an errand and saw this location next to a Fedex Office...perfect!  I dropped in and ordered:\\n\\nDouble Cookies & Cream, Strawberry, and Cheesecake...topped with Peanuts, Captain Crunch, and Reese's Peanut Butter Cup for around $4.90.\\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Co4cQNWyAYv7Hw8jKcEKJg?select=VcouxvxQ0Sl310XRxn9HOg\\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Co4cQNWyAYv7Hw8jKcEKJg?select=8xzd9ms7YvNaEAvn1irgsQ\\n\\nIt was of course awesome!  The line was very short too....even though the weather was in the mid-90's....boy did I luck out!\\n\\nReturn\\n Factor - 100%\\nWhat was once known as the Boomtown Hotel & Casino, this joint has come a long way.  The food is very good here and the value is great.  My friends and I enjoy coming here for a mid-week lunch buffet.  The selection of food is very good and we like how they serve the food in smaller portions on the buffet line so that it stays hot and fresh.\\n\\nWe also like to come here to browse the MASSIVE Bass Pro Shops store here.  Everything from Golf Clubs to bow & arrows to guns can be found here.  There's even an indoor shooting range for you to try out the weapons before you buy.....very cool!\\n\\nThe casino is not too large and has a good mix of games.  I no longer gamble, but my friends who do and live nearby enjoy coming here to play and get their monthly gift from the player's club.\\n\\nOverall, it's a fun Locals casino....I only wish it was closer to home.\\n\\nReturn Factor - 85%\\nAfter living here for 15 years, I finally went to my first NFR event.  Since I'm not a Cowboy, my expectat\\nions were very low.  I was pleasantly surprised to experience such an awesome event.  It is 10 days of non-stop action and partying!\\n\\nEvery event is action packed.....with my two favorites being the Bronc Riding and Bull Riding.\\n\\nThe key to really enjoying the rodeo is to get there early and spend some time outside the Thomas & Mack enjoying the food stands and beer tent.  You can find Philly Steak Sandwiches, Burritos, Italian Sausage & Pepper Sandwiches, Fries, Hot Dogs, Burgers, BBQ, and Pizza....and much more.  The food is better outside the arena than inside, which is your typical arena type food.\\n\\nThe beer is reasonably priced and your limited to your basic domestic beers.  If you want craft beers, head inside the Thomas & Mack and they have a few vendors that serve better stuff.  That's the only positive to the food choices inside.\\n\\nAnother tip is to make sure you dress warm.  It's the middle of December and it can get chilly outside.  Oh, and don't forget your Cowboy Hat!\\n\\nWill\", 'actual_label': 5, 'predicted_label': 5}, {'text': \" I return?  Hell ya!\\nThis hotel is awesome.  It's much nicer than the regular hotel at Mandalay Bay.  The rooms are more larger and more spacious.  The beds are more comfortable and the toiletries and amenities are much nicer.  \\n\\nHowever, you don't have to give up the convenience or location.  The lobby connects right into the heart of the Mandalay Bay casino, so you're right in the thick of things.\\n\\nOf course to get access to all of this it will cost you at least 30-40% more than a room at Mandalay Bay....but it's worth every penny.\\n\\nReturn Factor - 90%\\nSuper convenient location near my house.  The staff here is always good to me and provides me with great service.  The worst part about this location though is that the shopping mall it's in gets very busy and parking is tough.  Best time to go is very early in the morning, when it's not too busy....worst time to go is 10 am until the end of the day.\\n\\nReturn Factor - 90%\\nWifey and I enjoy checking out places like this.  Sometimes you f\\nind treasures, other times, nada.  We walked away from this place with the latter.  There's not much of a selection, but what do you expect from a store in a small town like Cave Creek?  Nevertheless, it was fun to browse for a little while.\\n\\nReturn Factor - 50%\\nThis place is straight out of Bizarro World....I mean it's super cool, yet kind of creepy.  If you've ever seen the movie The Dark Backward you'd know what I'm talking about.....or even House of a 1000 Corpses....it's just strange, but so cool you don't want to leave.\\n\\nThere are dozens of pinball machines dating from the mid 1900's to now.  What I love are the Old School 1970's & 1980's Original Video games like Donkey Kong, Paperboy, Defender, Spy Hunter, Space Invaders....you get the picture.  It was like I was 10 yrs old again.\\n\\nNow for the creepy stuff.  There is a Clown Puppet Carnival game where you put in a quarter and you can control it's arms & legs.  It is soooo weird and looks like a prop from a 1980's Horror Flick. \\n I posted a YouTube Video of this crazy thing in action here:\\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H5x-rANb10\\n\\nThen there is another creepy game with a Dollface Baseball Player (see pics)....it was made in 1967 and was in Circus Circus when it first opened.  The other creepy thing about this place is that it seems like nobody works here....I swear I couldn't find an attendant anywhere.....yet you could see tools & out of order games in the back where they are working.  The games are housed in an empty building with absolutely no decor or anything.....and it's really really dark in there.....only the sunlight & light from the games to keep it lit up.  Strange. ~Cue Twilight Zone Music~  I was waiting to see Rod Sterling in the corner of the room staring at me.\\n\\nThis is a must see in my book.\\n\\nWill I come back?  The next time I'm in the Twilight Zone....of course!\\nWhenever we are in Vegas and stay at the Palazzo, The Better Half insists on stopping by this joint so she can get her Sushi on.  \\nOn this particular visit, I joined her for lunch and we grubbed.\\n\\nShe ordered 4 orders of Unagi (Eel), $4 ea. I ordered some Edamame, $6 and the Seared Wagyu Beef, $18.\\n\\nThe Beef was awesome and while it's a small plate, it's very rich and fulfilling.  TBH enjoyed her Unagi....it's her fav.\\n\\nWe ate lunch at around 3 pm, which is a great time to do that because it's between the busy lunch and dinner hours, so there's not too many people around.  When it gets busy, it can get crowded.\\n\\nWe'll definitely be back.\\n\\nReturn Factor - 90%\\nI come to this store to get Lakers & USC Gear.  Lakers gear is no problem, but USC gear is hard to come by here.  But when they do get USC stuff, it's pretty good.  The last time I was here I bought 2 visors and a T-Shirt.\\n\\nWent to the store today to look for Lakers Championship gear, but I didn't like any of the styles they had, so I passed.  Great store located below the Rave Movie Theaters.\\nThey're a fun team to watch....but not for 16 innings!  We were at \\nthat marathon of a game.  We stayed until the 13th inning, then cried Uncle.  It wouldn't be too bad if we were able to keep our buzz going, but they stopped serving Beer in the 7th inning and we lost our buzz by the 10th.\\n\\nGood thing the Dbacks won....we listed to the end of the game on 620 on the drive home.

It was a good thing it wasn't too serious of an injury and we were pleased with the level of service here.  Since she didn't have a prior condition of low blood sugar, it took a little while for the doctor to figure out what happened.\\n\\nIn the meantime, the nurses took care of her and kept her in good spirits.

There are large sofas and love seats sprawled through one section of the bar, so there's plenty of room to relax.  The bar top is very wide, so there's plenty of room for your drinks and food.  There's even an outdoor area when the weather is nice....something for everyone.

Parking was easy and FREE!  I can't wait to come back next year!\\n\\nReturn Factor - 100%\\nI Geek-Out every time I come to this place.....and the wallet gets a lot lighter too!  Here's why:\\n\\n- The place is HUGE!  Imagine a place the size of a Costco, Sam's Club, or Super Walmart but full of electronics, computers, appliances, and video games!\\n\\n- Great selection of everything.  They have 10-20 different types of everything you can imagine.  This is the only place I can spend 10-15 minutes deciding what type of blank DVD to purchase, LOL.\\n\\n- Hard to find stuff.  This is where the Geekness comes out in me.  One day I bought 6 surveillance cameras, a digital recorder, and tons of cables just so I could outfit my house in a security surveillance system....did I need one?  No......but it looked like fun to setup so I spent the cash to do it.\\n\\n- Electronic\\n accessories.....wired or wireless anything can be found here, name brand/off brand, Mac or PC...you name it, if you can't find the accessory here, chances are no other store in Vegas will have it.\\n\\n- Great deals.  Check the Sunday paper.....there's always an insert with a page full of smoking deals......I'm not allowed to see this page.....The Better Half hides it from me.  Why?  Because it tends to bring out the compulsive shopper in me, ha ha!\\n\\nI really enjoy shopping here, can you tell?\\n\\nWill I return?  Are you kidding me?!\\nWas on my way to a friend's house and stopped for a quick bite to eat.  Ordered:\\n\\nVolcano Burrito - $2.99\\n7 Layer Burrito - $2.09\\nDouble Decker Taco Supreme - $1.89\\n\\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/4UmjnX46qbhV6-D5W89IOQ?select=SmsWfXhrU4AJl6D4nJu6bw\\n\\nThey were fast, accurate, and the food was decent.  It's a Taco Bell, what would you expect?\\n\\nReturn Factor - 15%\\nThree Square Food Bank is the local non-profit that supplies food and household items to area chariti\\nes for distribution to those in need.  They don't distribute directly to families, instead they collect all of the items, sort it, and sell it to organizations who serve the needy.\\n\\nMy family has been volunteering here for over 2 yrs.  My Son spends many hours during the Summer and my Wife and I volunteer when we can.  There are many jobs that you can work.  Most of the time we help in the warehouse area sorting food and household items.  It's monotonous work, but if volunteers don't do it the work doesn't get done quickly as there are so many items to sort.\\n\\nThe facility is large and well kept.  The workers there are passionate about their job and are very patient with us volunteers.  With so many volunteers that rotate in/out of the place they must have a lot of patience to train us.\\n\\nI encourage everyone to consider doing it.  It's really easy to sign up.....fill out a form online and then show up on scheduled dates/times.  Here's the link to more info and to the online volunteer fo\\nrm:\\nhttp://www.threesquare.org/how-to-help/volunteer/\\n\\nWe enjoy working here and will continue to volunteer as long as we're a part of this community.\\nThis gun range is tucked away behind a bunch of industrial buildings.  There's no way you'll find this place unless you have a GPS.  It's small relative to some of the others in the Phoenix area.  \\n\\nThe selection of firearms to rent or purchase are average.  I expected to see a much larger selection.\\n\\nIf I lived in the area, it would be adequate.  Good thing I don't.  I prefer to have more choices.\\n\\nThe prices for purchasing a firearm are higher than a normal gun shop, but lower than C2 Tactical and the Scottsdale Gun Club.  The people here are very nice and informative.  Not too many gun accessories to choose from though.\\n\\nOverall, I'd grade it a C.\\n\\nReturn Factor - 50%\\nOnce upon a time this was my favorite outlet mall.  However, in recent years it has gone downhill so I've been going to the Premium Outlet Mall in Downtown Las Vegas.  H\\nowever, this Christmas shopping season I decided to stop by and do some shopping here since it was raining and the other mall is an outdoor mall.\\n\\nThis mall is going under construction, which is a good thing because it needs a facelift.  Despite the slight inconvenience of the renovation, the shopping experience was pretty good.  I stopped by some old favorite stores that were still there and found a couple of new stores.  I'm glad I stopped by.\\n\\nWill I return?  Definitely after the renovation is complete.\\nThe Peppermill is a favorite of both locals & tourists.  The atmosphere and decor is a throwback to the Vegas of the 70's-80's.  One of the highlights of the property is the fireside lounge, which features an open fire pit that people can hang around.  The bright purple & blue neon flashes you back to the hey day of Vegas.\\n\\nFood - They offer a wide variety of dishes from Breakfast to Dinner.  Since I started working very close to the Peppermill, I will be here often for lunch.  Today\", 'actual_label': 5, 'predicted_label': 5}, {'text': \" I decided to give the Chicken Pesto sandwich a try.  It was very tasty and the serving was huge.  A nice sized portion of fries comes with the dish.\\n\\nService - Most of the time, they are very busy and you'll have to wait a little while for a table.  However, they crank out the orders and you get served in decent time.  It's hit or miss though as sometime you'll wait a while if they're really slammed.\\n\\nI gave this place 4 Stars because I've been a fan of it since I moved here in '93.  I will always return as long as they keep their atmosphere, food, and service the same.  Almost gave it 5 Stars, but the only thing that held me back was the hit or miss on the service levels.\\nFinally!  B-Dubs returns to Scottsdale.  Ever since the location in North Scottsdale closed, I've been waiting for it to return.  They opened earlier this week and we were anxious to give it a try.  Since they were new, we were expecting the worst in customer service...there are always a few hiccups here and there d\\nuring opening week....not here though!  \\n\\nWe were greeted by smiling, friendly hostesses who seated us at a table in the bar area.  We asked if they could put on a specific baseball game on one of the TV's, and they accommodated.  Our server gave us a run down of the menu & specials.  I threw her for a loop when I asked for an IPA, it was National IPA Day...she didn't know what that was.  That's ok, most people under 21 don't know what that is.  She smiled and said she'd ask the bartender and let me know.  She promptly returned and told me that they had Hop Knot IPA and Firestone IPA....I ordered the Hop Knot IPA first, then the Firestone 2nd...yum!\\n\\nFor dinner, we ordered:\\n\\nQueso & Chili Dip\\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/buffalo-wild-wings-scottsdale-2?select=35tWJX8t0jOppa8akUSfyQ#35tWJX8t0jOppa8akUSfyQ\\n\\nCheeseburger Sliders\\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/buffalo-wild-wings-scottsdale-2?select=MW6o7ZqiBpR3DI0Qdg4TTA#MW6o7ZqiBpR3DI0Qdg4TTA\\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/buffalo-wild-\\nwings-scottsdale-2?select=VcPnbq9ofF80r6IdSCM1yg#VcPnbq9ofF80r6IdSCM1yg\\n\\nBoneless Wings, 40 cents ea.\\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/buffalo-wild-wings-scottsdale-2?select=mZsJCccMnqgBmSE_B6RXQw#mZsJCccMnqgBmSE_B6RXQw\\n\\nThe food came out rather quickly and we enjoyed our dinner while watching baseball games and shooting the breeze.  Our server remained attentive the entire time and ensured that we were good.\\n\\nOverall, I am very impressed with their opening week.  I can't wait to come back during football season!\\nWe played the Talon Course a few weeks ago.  I was super excited to finally play Grayhawk...it's on my list of AZ courses and I could check it off.  However, my excitement turned into disappointment by the end of the day.  Here's why:\\n\\n- No GPS.  What's with the courses out here in AZ???  Very few have GPS yardage markers on their carts.  \\n\\n- Crappy yardage markers.  Ok, so you don't have GPS, at least have decent yardage markers on the course....nope.  We had a difficult time g\\nauging our distance during the round.  Yes, we ended up downloading an app to help out with that, but those things are not very reliable....we were 10-15 yds off all day.  Very frustrating.\\n\\n- Only 1 drink cart for 2 courses?!  Yes, it was blazing hot....100+ degrees and in 1 round only saw the drink cart twice!  Why?  She explained that she was the only drink cart serving both courses.....come on you cheapos, it's not that expensive to hire drink cart girls....it's very low cost labor and very noticeable to your customers....big disappointment.\\n\\n- The course itself was average, the greens average.  Everything was average.\\n\\nWith all of the problems above and an average course....it's a legit 2 Stars in my book.\\n\\nI hope they get their stuff together.\\n\\nReturn Factor - 20%\\nStopped by to pickup some cards for Mother's Day and some other random stuff.  The selection of greeting cards was decent.\\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jgTjppAwWr7rpd0FCquChQ?select=znaW3t4fpo8e1vy9JwEYcA\\nCandy select\\nion is also very good too.\\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jgTjppAwWr7rpd0FCquChQ?select=cU6ZHp3jSbx6O00Xyud92Q\\nWas able to get what I needed for Mother's Day.....score!\\n\\nThe other notable thing about this store is that the cashiers are very friendly.  One welcomed most of the customers by name and the other made some small talk when I was checking out.....genuinely nice people here.\\n\\nReturn Factor - 90%\\nSince I moved to Arizona 3 yrs ago, I've flown in/out of Sky Harbor many times.  When I want to grab a quick bite to eat before I head to the gates, I drop by here.  Their Cookies & Pastries are pretty good and service has improved in the time since my last review.\\n\\nReturn Factor - 75%\\nI'm a huge fan of this place and here's why:\\n\\nPro's\\n- Convenient....I work out at the 24 Hour Fitness next door.\\n- They often offer to wash your car while you work out & have people working at the gym to take your car to get it washed.\\n- The convenience store is clean and carries good products.\\n- They hav\", 'actual_label': 5, 'predicted_label': 5}, {'text': 'e full service attendants to gas up your car at no additional cost....only tips if you choose.\\n- Their oil change/smog check garage is quick and does a good job.\\n\\nCons\\nI seriously can\\'t think of any.\\n\\nWill I return? ...of course.\\nAfter a disastrous meal at the GVR Cafe, The Better Half and I went searching for some desserts.  We browsed all of the menus around the property and decided to give this place a try.  I asked the hostess if the desserts were good here and she said \"Absolutely, especially the Fried Oreos!\".....Fried Oreos?!!!  Sold!\\n\\nSince we just ate dinner, we saddled up to the bar, ordered a couple of glasses of Wine and the following desserts:\\n\\nFried Oreos, $9\\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hanks-fine-steaks-and-martinis-henderson?select=Fr6o_W_g8jRLTOy1xV966A#Fr6o_W_g8jRLTOy1xV966A\\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hanks-fine-steaks-and-martinis-henderson?select=UDuyjS-PR-QMefJCeCiRZQ#UDuyjS-PR-QMefJCeCiRZQ\\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hanks-fine-steaks-and-martinis-hender\\nson?select=QArOEViaXlGNlALYT_4ltQ#QArOEViaXlGNlALYT_4ltQ\\n\\nChocolate Cake, $9\\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/green-valley-ranch-grand-cafe-henderson?select=rFCV6YBghUVpNiiND6VEbQ#rFCV6YBghUVpNiiND6VEbQ\\n\\nLet\\'s start with the Fried Oreos....they are A-W-E-S-O-M-E....!!!  The Oreos are surrounded by a fluffy, Doughnut shell and come with a Creamy Dipping Sauce....when you mix the two together and bite into it, you feel a slight crunch from the Cookie of the Oreo....then all of the flavors combine in your mouth to take you to nirvana....yes, it\\'s that good!  Trust me.\\n\\nThe Chocolate Cake is pretty amazing too.  However, I\\'ve had great Chocolate Cakes before.  What sets this place apart is the Fried Oreos.  It\\'s so addicting that we stopped here every night of our stay to have them.  It\\'s a must try if you\\'re in the area.\\n\\nReturn Factor - 100% (as long as the Fried Oreos are on the menu)\\nWas doing some Christmas shopping and stopped by here with my Son to check it out.  I am really impressed\\n with the selection here!  They have tons of Dodgers, Lakers, Cowboys, UNLV, and USC logo\\'d apparel here....more than Front Row Sports, which is my \"go to\" place in town for that kind of stuff plus they had a buy 1 get 1 1/2 off sale.\\n\\nThe staff here was very friendly and ready to answer any question.\\n\\nI\\'ve found a new sports memorabilia place!\\n\\nWill I return?  You can count on it.\\nFor my 500th review, I thought it would be nice to review the city I\\'ve called home since \\'93.  We\\'ve grown up together.  I\\'ve seen it explode in the 90\\'s, get luxurious in the early 2000\\'s and collapse in the latter part of the 1st decade of the Millenium....now it\\'s time to reinvent the city and start over.  Ahh...such is life, Que No?\\n\\nWhat I LOVE about Las Vegas:\\n\\n- Tourists.....without them, there would be no Vegas.\\n\\n- 24 hour lifestyle\\n\\n- Last Call?  What\\'s that?  Sorry, I don\\'t understand what that means.\\n\\n- I can get a decent meal 24 hours a day.\\n\\n- World Class chefs & restaurants all within a few mi\\nles of each other.\\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz/stripsteak-las-vegas#hrid:WR1oJohv2eC1zHRm0ErU-Q\\n\\n- World Class shopping all within a few miles.\\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz/town-square-las-vegas-las-vegas#hrid:owHe9lMsn9rGS0zDyx4o0Q\\n\\n- Great golf courses.\\nhttp://www.yelp.com/list/amazing-golf-las-vegas\\n\\n- It\\'s sunny 98.7% of the time.\\n\\n- We\\'re not in California.\\n\\n- No State Income Tax.\\n\\n- We don\\'t have real \"traffic\" here....ask anyone from So Cal, Chi-town, SF, Seatte, or NYC.\\n\\n- The phrase \"Go Big Or Go Home!\" is not just a saying here, it\\'s a way of life.\\n\\n- We have awesome nightlife to suit anyone\\'s needs....shows, clubs, lounges, comedy acts, fountains, etc.\\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz/le-reve-las-vegas#hrid:4OPMX6UjEdytOdprS23YgQ\\n\\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz/pure-las-vegas#hrid:M5OT50XQ1j7WUSDzPFJQYA\\n\\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz/fountains-of-bellagio-las-vegas#hrid:5mSBxtxJXkCKC2b1hRys8A\\n\\n- We have a Pinball Hall of Fame.\\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz/pinball-hall-of-fame-las-vegas#hrid:dEMh-D4n7u7e8viNQVU\\nq1Q\\n\\n- National Finals Rodeo\\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz/wrangler-national-finals-rodeo-las-vegas#hrid:MXvTpqPAAxQVa0LxlRaVRA\\n\\n- Our Convention Center.....we have some kick-ass conventions here.\\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz/las-vegas-convention-center-las-vegas#hrid:2QVUbgFRLh_2P4FQrC5urg\\n\\n- UNLV....I\\'m glad I went here.  Awesome experience & education.\\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz/unlv-stan-fulton-building-las-vegas#hrid:gYBWYV4D3dGvNbXntpIc3w\\n\\nWhat I HATE about Las Vegas:\\n- People who Hate living in Vegas and want to change it to be like the city they came from.  I wouldn\\'t try to make Chicago, LA, NYC, or New Orleans like Vegas....so why would we try to make Vegas like any other city?  It\\'s crazy.\\n\\nOne day I may have to leave this wonderful city, but for now it\\'s where I call home.  Even if I leave, I will always come back to visit.\\nLiving in Las Vegas for over 17 years, one of the top questions I get asked every year is \"Where is the best place to watch Football and bet on sports?\".....the answe', 'actual_label': 5, 'predicted_label': 5}, {'text': 'r i always give them is the Las Vegas Hilton Sportsbook.  Here\\'s why:\\n\\nPROS\\n- It\\'s the World\\'s Largest Race & Sportsbook.....\"So What?\"  Well, that means there are plenty of betting windows, you can bet on almost anything....seriously, World Cup Soccer, Rugby, and many other odd bets you can\\'t find anywhere else in town.\\n\\n- Their Super Bowl proposition bets....this joint is known for their prop bets.  The number of prop bets is literally over 25 pages front & back!  You can get on stuff like.....who will score more points?  Kobe Bryant? or the total of the Super Bowl for both teams?\\n\\n- Easy access.....the sportsbook is located at the rear of the Hilton.  There is a parking lot back there that you can easily walk in, make your bet and walk back out to your car.  Most sportsbooks are a long walk to/from the parking lot.\\n\\n- Plenty of seats.....have you noticed how very few seats there are in most sportsbooks?  Not here....there are hundreds of seats throughout the book.\\n\\n- Football Centra\\nl.....ahh, my favorite part of this place.  Every NFL season, they have a FREE NFL football party located inside the Hilton Theater, which acts like an extension of the sportsbook.  There are huge Hi-Def screens that show every single NFL game at one time....yes, you can watch all of them at once!  The best part?  You can find seats!  Because it\\'s in the theater, there are over 1,000 seats in the lower level plus another 400 or so up in the balcony.  I like to bring large groups of friends here because we can always find seats and they are comfortable theater seats too!  Also, $1 Hot Dogs, $2 16 oz beers....and other food for $3-$7.  You can\\'t beat this football party!  I did a search on Google and found this YouTube video that shows it well:\\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJCiy308TdQ\\n\\n- Location.....the Hilton is located in the center of the city, next to the convention center....so it\\'s easy to get people from around the city to come together because it\\'s the same drive for everyone.\\n\\n\\nCONS\\n- I seriously can\\'t think of any.\\n\\nWill I return?  You bet! (no pun intended)\\nWanted to rent a car for The Better Half to use on a road trip and found this place on Expedia.  It was the lowest priced car rental joint in the Phoenix area, so we made a reservation.  When we arrived they asked her to provide a copy of 2 utility bills and a copy of our insurance....what?!  I\\'ve rented a car hundreds of times and have never heard of such a thing.  I thought I was going crazy and laughed....the person working the desk was serious.  They require 2 utility bills and a copy of your insurance?! To rent a friggin\\' car?! FAIL\\n\\nI quickly jumped on my iPhone and booked another reservation with Enterprise.  10 min later, we were in our rental car.\\n\\nThis company has no clue.  Who the hell keeps a copy of their utility bills nowadays?  I don\\'t.  I either have them electronically and don\\'t have paper copies or I throw them away immediately.  This company is a pure joke in my mind.\\n\\nReturn Factor \\n- 0%\\nHave only tried their Muffins here.  I was in a rush to get to my gate and they happened to have the shortest line.  The service was very slow even though there was only one person in front of me....crazy.  The person working there was friendly though.  The Muffin was so/so.  I was expecting much better since I\\'ve had their Cookies at one of their Scottsdale locations and they were phenomenal.  Oh well, will have to give it another shot sometime.\\n\\nReturn Factor - 64%\\nI\\'ve been to this location several times.  I like how it\\'s open late.  Have dropped by around 11:30 pm and it\\'s still open....bonus as things shut down in Scottsdale very early.\\n\\nFor a grocery store, there\\'s a really good selection of IPA\\'s here.\\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/NtvCX9UEWFvHSxQj06XQ0g?select=YduKHZAvsuXWYLeZnc_6cA\\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/NtvCX9UEWFvHSxQj06XQ0g?select=nwHhNWx62CDlHJ0bKJVpjw\\n\\nAnd the Wine Cellar is above average.\\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/NtvCX9UEWFvHSxQj06XQ0g?select=5b6BHBKI\\nJXzSAJmW8GXn-g\\n\\nThe store is kept clean and the employees are always helpful and friendly.  A nice overall shopping experience.\\n\\nReturn Factor - 90%\\nI needed to fax a pretty large document and stopped by here to get it done.  The old guy working the counter was pretty cool and took care of it, watching every page (23 pages) go through the fax machine, one by one, to make sure nothing went wrong.  Since it was a very important document, I\\'m very thankful for his personal attention.  I wish he wore a name tag so I could give him props.....he probably owns the joint.\\n\\nI don\\'t live nearby, so the chances I\\'ll return are pretty low, but that is not indicative of the service here.\\n\\nReturn Factor - 20%\\nTime to update my review.  Since my last review 2 yrs ago, we\\'ve come here several times and it has improved.  It\\'s of my Son\\'s favorite places for Burgers.  The Cajun Fries are outstanding and the Burgers are top notch.\\n\\nWe also love the Coke machine that has a ton of flavors and you can creat', 'actual_label': 5, 'predicted_label': 5}, {'text': 's located directly opposite the theater and so is a perfect way to pick up a cold snack after taking in a flick.\\n\\nUnlike some of the other frozen yogurt places that have more of a creamier tasting product, Pinkberry has a tartiness that some like and some don\\'t. You\\'ll want to get a free sample to see if it is to your taste before making a commitment. I found that the right topping addition cut the sweetness and really make for a delicious dessert. I\\'d recommend going with the nuts and not so much the sweeter toppings.\\n\\nAfter trying their pumpkin and chocolate, I ended up with a small cup (the next size up from kids) with the plain (vanilla).\\n\\nGood service from a youngster who knew the product and was more than happy to help me figure out how to enjoy it as well. I\\'ll be back!\\nUber in Canada, with a strong US dollar compared to a weaker Canadian dollar makes for some inexpensive rides. I did quite a few, since it was way faster than taking the shuttle from the hotel back to the airport\\n and then the bus from the airport to downtown. Quicker, more comfortable and really not that much more expensive.\\n\\nAll of my drivers were great and even if they didn\\'t speak perfect English, they spoke great English. Some interesting and fun conversations about Montreal and travel.\\n\\nAnd for Pierre, who was paying amazing attention when a white Lexus decided he needed to be where we were driving, thanks!\\nIf you\\'re in the mood to spend a lot of money on some running shoes, then Omega is the spot for you. That said, they seem very knowledgeable. When my daughter started getting some foot pain after working out on the treadmill at the gym, her doctor suggested giving one of these higher end shoe stores a first shot.\\n\\nSo we did. The two ladies who helped us really seemed to know what they were talking about. Whether or not they really did know it, or they were just good at giving us the run around (pun!), I don\\'t know for sure. But my daughter now has some $120 shoes and she\\'s back in the \\ngym.\\n\\nI\\'d suggest getting your first pair here and once you know what\\'s good, you might be able to find them much less expensively on Amazon or Zappos.\\nI was looking for a 7-Eleven and this popped up. Great little shop and yes, they\\'re friendly. When I walked in, I was greeted with a welcoming \"Hello. Welcome.\"\\n\\nI found a reasonable selection of candies and sodas. As well, an ATM that only charges $2.25. A deal!\\n\\nSadly, the lottery scratch ticket I bought was not a winner, so no fifth star. (I\\'m kidding.)\\nEarl\\'s is a chain of West Coast restaurants featuring upscale, but casual, dining. I\\'d say they\\'re a step or two above Friday\\'s or Tuesday\\'s or Chili\\'s. They still have fancy food menus with lots of colorful pictures and table-top menus with expensive (and specials that aren\\'t as expensive) drinks. Interesting and creative entrees and nibbles.\\n\\nI was wandering in the downtown area and Earl\\'s seemed to catch my eye. And looking at the menus, the Tuna Poke Nachos looked bright and color\\nful and really delicious. So I asked the waitress (they\\'re all really young and really pretty) to bring me one of \"those\" and a draft beer. A full 20 ounce pint was what I was expecting but as an American, that\\'s a whole lot of beer. I\\'m glad I wasn\\'t driving! The nachos arrived and they were just like in the menu. Maybe less tuna than I expected, but still a lot of flavor and spiciness. \\n\\nNo problem with rude or inattentive waitress, Aurora (real name?) was at my table when I needed her and not there when I didn\\'t need her.\\n\\nDecent food, decent drinks, reasonable prices. Free wifi. It was a three-star experience - A-OK.\\nTeeter, Teeter, Teeter. What are we going to do with you? When every store is nearly the same as every other, it\\'s hard to judge! Clean, bright, well-stocked, working carts, free samples smiling check-out associates. It\\'s just... awesome. Love Harris Teeter!\\nLocated in the part of the shopping plaza near Gander Mountain, MOD Pizza is a neat concept. It\\'s \"Chipotle\" mee\\nts pizza, but they don\\'t charge extra for the \"guacamole.\" Yes, they have a handful of set pizzas on the menu board but as they move your pie along the assembly line, you can add as many toppings as you like. No extra charges!\\n\\nI looked over the menu board and settled on the \"Season\\'s Mod\" which had roasted Brussels Sprouts, red onions, gorgonzola and a balsamic glaze. And while that probably would have been enough, I also took the recommendation of one of the Mod Squad and added chicken. Good idea!\\n\\nA few minutes later, my name was shouted and I stepped up to pick up my pie. Sliced into four neat quarters, the thin crust pizza base was nice and crunchy. Plenty of toppings and it tasted absolutely amazing. Full of great flavors. Very enjoyable.\\n\\nNeat vibe in this fast casual restaurant. It\\'s not a date night place, more the sort that you can bring the whole family.\\nThanksgiving shopping is DONE! We went to HoneyBaked early Sunday afternoon and got the ham and the turkey and a few fixin', 'actual_label': 6, 'predicted_label': 6}, {'text': \"gs. Very helpful staff who walked us through what we wanted and helped us determine the right quantities. It sure isn't cheap though!\\n\\nThis stuff doesn't have to be bought the day before, ya know? You can get it a little earlier because the line tends to grow as the holidays approach.\\nIt's a new and clean McDonald's. Clean bathroom, the crew was pretty good at taking and filling my order. It's not hard to mess up a McChicken and small fries with a bottle of water. A-OK.\\nThis shopping plaza is decent when it's not the really busy time of the year, other than the design makes it hard to see more than a few shops at a time. It's layers and layers and between those layers, it's a very narrow driving alley with not much parking.\\n\\nAnd at lunch time on New Year's Eve Eve (12/30), the place was packed, most spaces were filled and a few people were even double-parking which made it ten times worse.\\n\\nIf you're shopping Blakeney, bring a trunk load of patience.\\nCrowded on a Sunday as the nearby c\\nhurch had let out. Coincidence or not, this place was packed with bargain shoppers. And the parking lot had a decent queue for people dropping stuff off.\\n\\nThe best deals and the widest variety of stuff in great condition in this Goodwill is clearly in the clothing area with a long rack of designer jeans, neatly hung up. Other clothing was neatly organized and priced to sell.\\n\\nIn the furniture and home goods department, much of it looking rather beat up. A large selection of VHS cassettes and DVD disks picked over and stack haphazardly.\\n\\nI did happen to see a really decent looking sofa at the amazing price of $14.99. That's just nuts! A very little cleaning and it would be good as new.\\nCheap! Cheap! Cheap! And inexpensive, too!\\n\\nI have a new apartment. I need a few things and this was the perfect spot! I got a two drawer filing cabinet and a desk with hutch for $15 each. A fantastic deal!\\n\\nYep, there are sofas and dining sets and all sorts of other stuff and when I'm looking to trick ou\\nt my place a bit more, I'll be back for some of that.\\nA dive-ish sports bar, it's an interesting spot with excellent burgers, a billion television sets and a reasonable selection of mass-produced beers.\\n\\nI met a few friends here, but I was late to arrive. By the time I showed up, they had already placed their orders and the menus cleared. When i was able to flag down a waitress, I ordered a burger (someone suggested the Carolina) and the sweet potato fries. And a PBR, because it seemed appropriate.\\n\\nThe kitchen was able to fast track my burger so it showed up at the same time as my friends. The Carolina is seriously messy but it's loaded with fatty meaty greasy goodness. And the sweet potato fries were excellent.\\n\\nWe didn't stick around for long - down the road to bowl!\\nA deli, but not a New York style deli. Great sandwiches with a good variety of quality meats and cheeses - ham, turkey, roast beef and such. On sub rolls or a bread (including rye, white and whole wheat).\\n\\nThe sandwiche\\ns run between $5.50 and $7.00, so it's all pretty inexpensive. Sodas include canned Dr. Browns and they do have some wine and beer available.\\n\\nWe enjoyed what we ate, but I was hoping for bagels and smoked fish. Oh well.\\n\\nConvenient location on East Independence if you're headed into the city. If you're heading out, you'll have to exit and go through a neighborhood, or continue onwards and make a u-turn.\\nExtremely busy on a Sunday morning, I got in and managed to snag the last seat at the counter. But then, the counter was grubby, my waitress didn't bring me a menu or take my order for a bit, and didn't bring back my coffee. Yes, it was very busy.\\n\\nFood arrived a little haphazard. Waffle first, then a few minutes later, my eggs and hash browns. And then my plate of city ham. And then somehow, a second plate of city ham. Weirdly timed, but it was very busy.\\n\\nAll of it was cooked properly. And the payment taking was easy enough.\\n\\nSet a low expectation and you'll be pleased with the outco\\nme.\\nWith a dozen showings of the latest big blockbuster, picking a movie time that worked for us was easy. Not much of a line to buy tickets even though our showing was pretty much sold out when the previews finished and we could see that all of the seats were filled.\\n\\nSound? Good. Not too loud.\\nPicture clarity? Excellent.\\nConcessions? Expensive, of course. Why pay $5.50 for a medium when twice as much is only a dollar more? And no plain M&M's? Boo!\\nPopcorn smelled like a batch had recently burned, so we skipped it.\\nBathroom? First two stalls wouldn't flush. Not enough hand dryers to match the number of sinks.\\nPopped into the bookstore for a bit to make some time pass while my wife was nearby in an appointment. Surprise, there's a small coffee shop here in a space that could well be a closet.\\n\\nBut the coffee was better than the stuff they sling at *$ and it wasn't any more expensive.\\nA friend of mine is in the market for an AR-15 and so we took a day to tour the various gun shops of th\", 'actual_label': 6, 'predicted_label': 6}, {'text': 'e Charlotte metropolitan area. We didn\\'t find one, but we did get to look at a whole mess of firearms for sale here. It\\'s not a full gun shop, so their selection isn\\'t massive but they still have a handful of pistols and a large display of older rifles if that\\'s your thing.\\n\\nAnd then there are all the other things that you might expect in a pawn shop, from coins and collectibles to heavy tools and construction machinery to DVD\\'s and VHS cassettes to gaming consoles. Prices seemed pretty good and the staff was certainly helpful.\\nI\\'ve visited Dragon Buffet a handful of times and it\\'s been the same experience every time - consistency is key.\\n\\nThe chef is out at the buffet tables often and it\\'s rare that any tray goes nearly empty for long, even as late as 8pm.\\n\\nIt\\'s not high-end Chinese food, but it is pretty good for buffet quality. Don\\'t miss the Black Pepper Pork, the Indian Chicken or the Mongolian Beef. All are quite good. The rest is only so-so.\\n\\nSeveral of the battered and fried ch\\nicken bits in assorted sauces I have seen at other buffets, which I skipped. The baked crab is so greasy and oily, I skip that too.\\n\\nThey do sometimes have spare ribs but the few times I tried them, I found them overcooked and with too much \"char\" on them as well as being more of the \"end\" cuts rather than the meatier \"center\" pieces. The wontons are not fried and they do have dim sum on the steam table.\\n\\nThe dessert bar is okay with the usual banana pudding, seriously chewy macaroons and a bunker of self-serve ice cream.\\n\\nAt less than $10 for dinner, it\\'s a pretty good bargain.\\nIn the daytime when the temperature is blowing past a hundred degrees, I\\'m not climbing a small mountain. But first thing in the morning (before coffee!), I\\'ll give it a try and experience the view. Only 72 degrees at this point. No excuses.\\n\\nStreet parking and a pay lot at the base of the Butte. Clearly marked trails, the first half of which is pretty well paved. There\\'s a base station at that point with a pre\\ntty good view of Tempe and you can feel accomplished if you get this far.\\n\\nBut hey, I was feeling a little guilty for that plate of chili cheese fries from last night and so I pressed onwards. The top half of the Butte has been laid out with concrete and railroad tie steps that take you to about 95%. At the point, there\\'s something close to a path of hard scrabble rocks with a hand railing that will take you right to the top.\\n\\nFrom the top, a great view of Tempe and the various sky scrapers that are all shorter than this \"mountain.\" You also get a very good view of the field over at Phoenix Sky Harbor with the occasional aircraft zooming overhead.\\n\\nIt\\'s a decent incline and a nice hike in a mostly controlled environment that\\'s busy enough to feel safe and it\\'s close to development and services. The trailhead is at 1180 feet and the summit is at 1495 feet. That\\'s a decent climb for a city boy.\\n\"Contain yourself\" is their slogan but there\\'s more here than just containers. Organizers for \\ndesks, wrapping paper, shelving and even a large section of travel stuff like suitcases and passport wallets and three ounce squeezy tubes so you can still bring your shampoo on the plane! Huge selection of Christmas wrapping paper.\\n\\nLots of the stuff is crazy expensive. $200 for a shelving unit? Holy cow! But there are a few bargains to be found. I picked up a nice glass jar for under $10 and a weekly pill case for $4.\\n\\nService is excellent and they\\'ll be more than happy to help you figure out how to solve your storage issues.\\nA really good breakfast burrito here and a strong cup of coffee, while I was waiting for my car to get serviced around the corner. It\\'s a neat little spot with several tables and a bar that looks a bit more \"wine\" than \"breakfast\" but that\\'s okay.\\n\\nBreakfast burrito had some delicious cubed sweet potatoes in there and that was super delicious. Eggs and cheese and more. Yum!\\n\\nWhen I\\'m looking for a small spot to meet for a glass of wine, I\\'ll be back to Roots.\\nSt\\nill consistent and still decent, but I would say that I\\'ve experienced better. If you have a formula that works, stick to it. Since I started stopping by Dragon, the layout of the restaurant and the steam tables haven\\'t changed. And more importantly, the food items haven\\'t changed. They still offer a Black Pepper Pork and there are Barbecue Spare Ribs at dinner and the steamed dimsum and fried dumplings are there all day. Chicken & Broccoli and Lo Mein and such, too.\\n\\nThey\\'ve had a few platters of sushi - nothing more than California Rolls - occasionally.\\n\\nWith all of that said, there\\'s a new player in town. Not even a mile further south is Jasmine Buffet which has more tables, better sushi and a cook-to-order hibachi grill with fresh veggies. Though it is a little more expensive there.\\nThis Starbucks is in a super spot, especially if you can snag one of the tables up against the glass. From this great perch, you can sit and watch the city of Charlotte walk by. Strongly recommended on ', 'actual_label': 6, 'predicted_label': 6}, {'text': \"a game day when the silver blue and black are practically a parade!\\n\\nCoffee is standard Starbucks - slightly overdone and slightly overpriced. There are also coolers of pastries and cold drinks.\\n\\nWhile they do have wi-fi, I did not spot any power outlets. The bathroom needed a tidy and restock, but I suppose that's normal for an urban location.\\nWhen I was in Las Vegas a few years ago, we never seemed to have enough time to get to the Bellagio to see the fountain and so for this visit, I made sure to get here. Twice! Once at night and once in the daytime. \\n\\nFirst off, unlike SO MANY other things in Las Vegas, the fountain is completely and utterly free. Stay here as long as you like, the fountain goes off every hour. Watch the water dance and jump, choreographed to music. The first time, I watched and listened to Andrea Bocelli and Celine Dion signing The Prayer. Absolutely magical, five stars. The second time, it was Shania and it was four stars but still wonderful.\\n\\nDo not miss this w\\nhen you come to Vegas.\\nAnother formulaic execution of the Walgreens system. This is a perfect store with the usual aisles of personal care, over-the-counter medications, a pharmacy, snacks and drinks and a seasonal aisle. I was able to purchase the cold meds I needed, a bottle of water with which to wash it down and a box of tissues for blowing my stuffed nose very quickly.\\n\\nIt's a good store that is in the middle of absolutely nowhere.\\nMy lovely wife has never before had a fish taco and after hearing me tell her over and over again that it wasn't what she though it was, and that she would really enjoy it, she finally relented. And yep, she loved it. So much so that she now wants to go back to Paco's almost immediately.\\n\\nService was very good - we let Shauna pick our tacos for us, as long as there was at least one fish taco on each plate. Good move! She asked some questions about our preferences for spiciness and allergies and got it taken care of.\\n\\nYep, we'll go back!\\nDon't skip the r\\nestaurant! Ikea is so much more than flat pack furniture!\\n\\nI came up here early one morning and made a stop for coffee and some great Swedish pancakes with lingonberry sauce (a bit like cranberries, just not as tart) while I went through my mental list of the stuff I needed for my new Charlotte apartment. Once that was done, it was off for a wander through the furniture showrooms (yep, I'll have one of those and one of those and one of those that probably won't fit in the car) and then the smaller kitchen and housewares showroom areas.\\n\\nWhen it was time to start picking my furniture from the warehouse, I'd picked up a dozen little things, several of which I had no idea that I needed, but dang it, I really do need that! Pulling a futon bed and mattress onto the flat trolley and out to the register to pay for it.\\n\\nIkea offers a 1% coupon when you use your debit card to make the purchase. And they'll sort of help you load stuff into your car, they're just not allowed to do the tying down.\\n Fortunately, the futon mattress fit once I put the seats down and I guess I can still drive with it poking me in the kidney.\\n\\nA couple of tips: Have a list. Arrive early. Be patient. And don't skip the restaurant or the food shop at the end. You have no idea how many different ways there are to smoke and can and bottle different fish!\\nThere are a handful of places to hang out and have a proper sit down meal in the Charlotte airport. Uptown gets the job done if you're halfway down the A concourse and not interested in a Wendy's burger.\\n\\nBut they do have burgers and fries and pizza. And lots and lots of booze.\\n\\nSo if you're looking for a little dutch courage before you board your aluminum can, Uptown is the spot.\\nI'll agree with Gabriel, except that I didn't manage to visit the UPS Customer Center. Yes, I did go there today, a Saturday. They're closed. Seriously, what the heck is that about? Isn't this a big city? Isn't this a major delivery center for them? I guess not.\\n\\nThe problem st\\narted when the shipping address on my package was off my one digit, but UPS didn't call me or email me to correct it. Instead, I happened to notice on the tracking page this morning that there was a problem. So I called (the first time) and the agent said that there was nothing I could do - I would have to wait until Monday to call, fix the address then, and they would try to deliver on Tuesday. I actually believed that for about a half hour. And then I thought... doesn't UPS take pride in being a logistics company? Can't a package be rerouted in transit? So I called and this time, the agent said that she would send a message to the local warehouse and they would call me in an hour.\\n\\nThree hours went by. So I figured I would go to the dang warehouse and wait for the driver to return so that I could get my package. They're closed. So I called a third time, and this agent apologized for the previous agent's error that someone would call me.

I don\\'t think so.\\nNice Apple store on two levels and free wifi, even for those of us who are rocking with an Android. Interesting to see the advertisements and signage in French.\\nMy wife made the decision to eliminate meat from her diet a few months ago. No beef, no pork, not even chicken or turkey. No shellfish, but fish including salmon and mahi mahi is still cool as are eggs and dairy. It\\'s been an interesting time trying to eat around this new program, especially since my daughter and I are unrepentant flesh-craving carnivores.\\n\\nFor this week\\'s family brunch, I offered to try a restaurant completely focused on vegan and vegetarian options. Fern hit the spot with great reviews and options that I felt would minimally inconvenience us \\nmeat eaters while giving my wife options other than salad.\\n\\nAs Mrs. K. is still figuring out vegan, I could see that the menu was a little complicated. So while we studied it, I got us started with coffee (with almond milk. Stevia and Sugar-in-the-raw on the table) and the cinnamon rolls. The rolls arrived and we were able to place our brunch order. Tasty and doughy, not too sweet at all. Yum.\\n\\nSausage and gravy for my wife, Mediterranean scramble for daughter and the zucchini/spinach benedict for me. It was clear by what was left when we asked for the check who had enjoyed their meal most thoroughly. It was me - my plate was clear. The zucchini fritters were tender and moist, sort of like a crab cake except without crab. Topped with steamed spinach, poached eggs and hollandaise, really tasty. I\\'d recommend it thoroughly.\\n\\nThe scramble wasn\\'t that great, according to daughter. Rather bland, she said. And she didn\\'t care for the quinoa. Oh well. Mrs said that the biscuits were too cakey\\n but the gravy was good.\\n\\nFor sides, I had the crispy braised fingerling potatoes. It was as close to home fries as you\\'re going to get and they were perfectly crunchy and salty. The sweet potatoes were good (tender and sweet), but not the best choice for their brunch meals.\\n\\nService was excellent. The coffee was great. And the price was pretty decent.  I don\\'t know that we\\'d return for brunch, but only because it\\'s challenging for the carnivores. Maybe lunch or dinner next time. That said, you herbivores would love this place.\\nEverything you would expect from a funeral home. Plenty of parking, a large quiet chapel area with lots of noise baffling, muted tones with lots of light colored wood and plenty of seating. Ushers were working hard to make sure that the pews were getting filled up properly or there would have been people standing in the back. All of these to make sure that there were no distractions from honoring our departed friend.\\n\\nI don\\'t know if the organist was part of the\\n funeral home or hired by the family, but either way he was excellent.\\n\\nA great service and a great facility. Thank you, Ellington.\\nI\\'ve known Poprock since before I was ever an Elite Yelper. Tonya was \"old school\" Charlotte Yelp before there was even a Charlotte community manager! I\\'ve seen her handiwork and she\\'s taken pictures at Yelp Elite events through three different community managers (Nicole, Ben, Nikki).\\n\\nAnd not just Yelp events! I\\'ve seen Tonya\\'s great photography selected in local bridal and wedding magazines. She does some real quality work with her camera. She is calm, she is professional, and she is a great picture taker!\\n\\nOh, and if you\\'re ever lucky enough to go out to dinner with Tonya, let her order the Indian food. She\\'s amazing!\\nI\\'ve been hearing a lot about this place but since my wife opted for a vegan food regimen, hitting up a place with counters of steaks and a menu focus on meat is going to make for a difficult date night. So when I was in the area on my own\\n, I popped in for lunch.\\n\\nNice menu with, of course, a lot of meats. I chose the store-made pastrami sandwich with a side of mac & cheese. Grilled on rye bread, the meat was tasty and the bread was crispy. Maybe a little greasy, but that\\'s to be expected.\\n\\nThe mac & cheese was excellent. I\\'m not sure what cheese they put in there, but it was creamy and tangy with a little bit of bite to it. Also a little oily at the bottom and that\\'s also to be expected.\\n\\nService was good, the speed of my meal was good and the price was acceptable.\\n\\nLooking forward to returning with a meat eater.\\nIt\\'s bigger on the inside because the store is on two stories. There\\'s a flight of stairs and an elevator that moves quickly and has enough room for at least three shopping carts.\\n\\nThis Teeter has the usual excellent shopping experience with well stocked and well leveled shelves, plenty of room to move about, bright lights and shopping carts where all four wheels work great.

As the saying goes \"... and we pass the savings on to you.\" You need a $1 coin to release a shopping trolley from the corral in the parking lot. Plastic bags are 5 cents each. Very few staffers around.\\n\\nYes, they have a large selection of the brand name merchandise but they also have quite a few items that are (literally) \\'No Name\". From soda to napkins to charcoal briquettes, these generic own-brand items are probably just as good as the regular stuff. In fact, it\\'s probably made by the same manufacturers to the same specifications, but labeled this way.\\n\\nLarge produce section and a bulk-food area that includes nuts and cooking chocolate and other candies. Meat and seafood. Canned goods. Ethnic foods. And then a dry goods area t\\nhat includes personal care, electronics, housewares and even a small section of clothing. Pharmacy.\\n\\nIf I was living in Calgary, I imagine that I would be doing most of my shopping here. And I would remember to bring a coin for the trolley.\\nEveryone told me that Montreal is famous for its smoked meat and its bagels. And that St. Viateur is *the* place to go for bagels. Well, they were right about the bagels. While it\\'s not \"New York\" flavor, it\\'s \"New York\" style. Slightly crunchy on the outside and chewy on the inside. It\\'s not better than New York (I don\\'t want a New Yorker to whack me), it\\'s just different. Slightly smaller and maybe slightly sweeter.\\n\\nI took the Métro to Mont Royal station and walked the few blocks over to here. Nice neighborhood that felt rather \"Greenwich Village\" in the daytime, I wouldn\\'t worry about it.\\n\\nGreeted in French, but I was able to order in English without difficulty. Free wi-fi.\\nI rode five or so Ubers this weekend in Cleveland, including one from th\\ne airport to downtown and another from the hotel to the brew pubs when it was bucketing down with rain. It was all perfect and the same Uber that I\\'ve ridden in Charlotte, in Fort Lauderdale, in San Francisco and in Wilkes-Barre. What an amazing technology and it all worked well in Cleveland.\\n\\nOnly one bump, where I rated my driver four stars instead of five. He gave me a pretty solid attempt to get me to call him to talk about his multi-level financial business. I took his card and proceeded to bin it. Other than that, a great time.\\n\"Why spend money when you don\\'t have to\" is my motto. I probably should put that in my Yelp profile somewhere because it\\'s true. Another one is \"Money is to pay people to do things that you don\\'t want to do yourself\" but I digress. We\\'re here at Aldi, where it\\'s all about less expensive groceries and produce. They trim their costs by not having big fancy displays or endcaps, with a very limited selection (typically only one brand of an item and only in one\\n size) and a limited staff (typically two cashiers, a stocker and a manager). You need to have a quarter to get a shopping cart (you get it back when you return) so that they don\\'t have to invest in a cart wrangler or tie up parking spaces with cart corrals. The staff at this location is friendly and efficient and no, they don\\'t bag your groceries for you. It\\'s back into the cart and then you get to bag \\'em up yourself out of the way.\\n\\nMost of the stuff is from brands you will never have heard of, but in almost all cases a bottle of ketchup is a bottle of ketchup and a jug of milk is the same as any other you can get at the Teeter or Wally World. If an Aldi shop is convenient for you, why go anywhere else to spend more? Maybe some don\\'t like this low cost method of doing business, but that\\'s fine. You\\'re paying more to enjoy that convenience and \"higher touch\" shopping experience.\\n\\nYou\\'ll want to bring your own bags, as Aldi charges for those.\\n\\nAs Chad mentions, Aldi does NOT accept cr\\nedit cards as it\\'s another cost thing. You have to bring cash or use a debit card.\\nPractically an institution, I\\'ve been to Ru-San\\'s at least a dozen times, always for lunch. The self-serve buffet of sushi isn\\'t the absolute best quality, but there are usually a few good finds. They usually have salmon or tuna sushi as well as several of their creative and innovative rolls. At least half are fried, which is always an interesting option. This is, after all, the South. :-)\\n\\nYou can easily avoid the fried stuff and focus on the raw fish. Plenty of options, even on the slower days, the stuff doesn\\'t sit out there for long. On the back table (you didn\\'t know there were two?) are usually a steam tray with lo mein and egg rolls and sometimes fried chicken drumsticks and wings. I\\'ve spotted big trays of tuna and salmon sashimi there on occasion.\\n\\nYou can\\'t beat the price. $10 with water or $12 if you get a soda. That\\'s a deal and a half!\\n\\nI love it.

In fact, it\\'s probably too much for just two people. A full pound of nachos (we were told they fry them here in the kitchen rather than buy them already cooked) and a pound of grilled chicken with a lot of melted cheese, chopped onions and scoops of sour cream and guacamole.

I was across the street for a class and this was really the only option within walking distance. Standard BK fare - my Whopper with cheese and no pickle was as I ordered it.

An item dropped on the floor was cleaned up swiftly.\\n\\nBut the food itself see\\nms to be lacking. There\\'s a lot more western food here including mac & cheese, chicken tenders and pizza and stuff for the kids, and there\\'s a lot less Chinese. Really only six or so dishes with a protein in them and two were \"& broccoli.\" Too much fried and too many heavy sauces.\\n\\nThe sushi is fresh and updated, but it wasn\\'t the right kind of rice. The texture of the nigiri was too tight, too dry and unflavored.\\n\\nThe hit here is probably still the hibachi grill but that\\'s not my thing.\\nAfter a bit of searching, I did find Futo Buta. It is at the south end of the light rail station, on the side closest to South Blvd. Inside, a nice lay out with high top and low top tables. Most of the seating is stools that have no backs. This is nice for 15 or 20 minutes but after a half hour, it\\'s going to be uncomfortable. On a nice day, the outside chairs might be more comfy.\\n\\nOn to the main event, the ramen. I went right to the top of the menu, the Tonkotsu. A ton of different individual flavors \\nand textures in this large bowl of pork broth and of course, a big serving of ramen noodles underneath the surface. Very tasty, a little messy, well worth it.\\n\\nWhile they do have a good selection of beers and several other drinks in the cooler, water is a good idea for all the sodium you\\'ll be enjoying.\\n\\nYou will want to wear something in a dark solid color or with lots of colors on it. This stuff does splash.\\n\\nParking. Well, I found a metered spot on the street. But there is also a parking deck with a few free hours next door too. Oops.\\nOccupying a prime piece of real estate in downtown Cleveland, a structure like this needs to be perfect. And it met that expectation in spades. Well maintained inside and out, with a recent restoration in 2009. And even though some of the outside is closed due to nearby construction, it\\'s still a great stop.\\n\\nThe Soldiers\\' and Sailors\\' Monument is a memorial to those who served in the Civil War. The monument dates back to its opening in 1894 and is com', 'actual_label': 6, 'predicted_label': 6}, {'text': 'pletely free of charge, though donations are heartily accepted. The Monument is a 125 granite tower carved with the names of the major battles where Cuyahoga soldiers fought in the War and is topped with a statue of the \"Goddess of Liberty.\" Inside, a list of tablets listing the 9,000 veterans that served with Cuyahoga regiments or were from Cuyahoga County.\\n\\nDo take the time to check it out. Well worth it!\\nNot speedy but good and cheap. If you\\'re ordering a sandwich, be patient. This restaurant shares its space with a Wendy\\'s.\\nAn Irish-style pub and therefore they have Guinness on tap. This was one of our stops on the Light Rail Bar Crawl and so the timing was short. Rather than wait for the Guinness to settle, I had a draft Harpoon.\\n\\nUpstairs is a whole different area and yes, there is a proper bar upstairs with the usual selection of draft and bottled beers plus spirits. The two bartenders working that night were friendly but it was hard to hear anything over the rather loud music. \\nFortunately, we managed to escape before the DJ started spinning tunes.\\n\\nOf the bars we hit during the Crawl, this was my favorite.\\nLong wait for a waitress to take our order and an inordinate amount of time waiting for her to bring two Guinnesses to the table. And then a long wait for the check. We were going to stay and order some food but bailed. I don\\'t be back.\\n\\nNo wi-fi, or at least if there was, I wasn\\'t able to connect to it.\\nGreat selection here at Jasmine and if Dragon wants to compete, they\\'re going to have to step up their game. Yes, Jasmine has the usual chicken & broccoli and BBQ ribs and spicy black pepper pork. And yes, they have a hibachi grill with a decent selection of things you can have cooked to order in a stir-fry.\\n\\nSeveral Americanizes items too, like pizza and meatloaf and such, for those who aren\\'t into \"Chinese\" food. And a large dessert bar with 8 self-serve ice creams, jellos, macaroons and puff pastries.\\n\\nWhere Jasmine is winning is in the sushi. At least \\na dozen different plates of sushi items available with a variety of tuna, salmon, eel and more. Tubs of pickled ginger and wasabi available too. The fish was decent (not fantastic) and the rice was more like Chinese rice than sushi rice, but it\\'s still better than the Chinese buffets I\\'ve experienced in the Charlotte area.\\n\\n$11 for dinner (or weekend lunch) is reasonable. Plus tip.\\nStopped in for breakfast this morning and had an excellent meal. Classic diner food here on the menu, I stuck to the simple stuff and they did a fine job.\\n\\nMushroom omelet with cheddar cheese. Served with home fries and toast, it was done just right.\\n\\nPlenty of coffee and they have a wifi as well.\\n\\n[Review 9960 overall, 1540 of 2018.]\\nI hate this shared bus crap. Is it just me, or is the airport actually closer to the Las Vegas Strip than this rent-a-car center?\\n\\nToo much walking, too many buses and too long a ride. Just like Baltimore and Seattle and others where you get on a shared bus with everyone else a\\nnd their luggage, regardless of whether or not you have any status with your car rental company.\\n\\nI think next time, I\\'ll just get a danged taxi.\\nGreat pizza with interesting toppings in the Seventh Street Market. And they have local beer on tap, what\\'s not to love?\\n\\nI got their chorizo topped pizza which also had some cilantro and fresh tomatoes. Made to order, it took a few minutes until it was brought to my table. By that time, I was well into my pint of Triple C\\'s Golden Boy beer. I\\'ll need another of those, please.\\n\\nPrices are okay ($5 for a local draft is quite reasonable) and there were enough seats around the dinner hour. Note that they do close at around 7pm.\\nGreat meal and great service. Huge portions and a nice little spot in Ayrsley for an Italian dinner.\\n\\nWe started with a plate of mussels in white sauce to start. Heavy on the garlic and butter, but a big plate and fun to eat. Maybe a special fork would have been useful because after about two of them, you just give up and\\n go at it with fingers. At the end, you\\'re left with a plate of butter and garlic that\\'s perfect for the table bread.\\n\\nThe caesar salad was a big miss. A platter of romaine lettuce topped with croutons that did not seem handmade and then shredded mozzarella cheese? With a small pot of sharp caesar dressing on the side. Me, I prefer my salad dressing already tossed into the salad and with actual parmesan cheese. We took a couple bites and then left the rest.\\n\\nThe main course was great. My wife opted for the Chicken Marsala. The chicken was tender and the mushrooms and sauce were flavorful and rich. The marinara sauce on the pasta was a little sweet and heavy with basil.\\n\\nI chose the Chicken Gorgonzola. The sauce was very rich and very cheesy. Lots of mushrooms in there. Where my wife\\'s chicken was tender, mine was a little rubbery and tough. Not enough to send back, but enough that it took some effort to cut with the steak knife. Since hers was perfect, I\\'m thinking that mine was just a', 'actual_label': 6, 'predicted_label': 6}, {'text': \"n off one.\\n\\nFor dessert, we got a tiramisu to share. Almost entirely lady fingers and mascarpone custard, there was no rum or coffee soaked into it. Sweet and tasty, but not quite tiramisu.\\n\\nOverall, a good meal and great service from Tiffany. I'm a fan.\\nEfficient and speedy. When it's a weekend and you don't feel like waiting until Monday to try and make an appointment to see your primary care physician, Urgent Care fills a niche.\\n\\nCoughing and wheezing and sniffling my way in, the clerk at the desk took my details and had me fill out a form. When I returned, she took my copay while I waited to see the doctor. About 20 minutes later, into the small room where I waited another few minutes before the doctor came in. He gave me a thorough exam and determined that I had a chest and nasal infection. A prescription later and a recommendation for bed rest (uh, no. travel instead), I was out the door.\\n\\nWould I return? Absolutely. Good stuff!\\nReturned my rental truck here and the girl at the c\\nounter was extremely efficient and helpful. It was not a problem that I wanted to drop off the trailer first and then return a couple of hours later to return the trailer (I didn't want to try and hook it back up because I'm sure I would have gotten it wrong). When I returned the truck, we drove over and inspected the trailer then we checked the truck. No problem.\\n\\nIn, out, done!\\nGreat cheese section, terrific butchery and foshmonger, lots of bulk items and a grocery section that is designed for the higher end shopper who likes organic range free ethically sourced etc. I don't know if I'd be able to afford a full weekly shop here, but it's certainly possible.\\n\\nThe store is big (bigger than the one in Southpark) and there's plenty of parking.\\nMeeting a couple of people here for a Yelp gathering, I was impressed. (Strangers are just friends you haven't met yet!) Comfortable neighborhood style restaurant with great pub grub style food and an extensive selection of beers, local and faraway\\n. I don't know if our service was typical - our Yelp status was common knowledge - but it was good. The waitress took great care of the table and was very helpful with beer selections.\\n\\nI had the hummus appetizer and really enjoyed it. Lots of garlic in there and good amount of pita pieces and tortilla chips for scooping it up. The beer was cold! Other selections at the table looked good too and the jerk teriyaki chicken wings smelled great!\\n\\nPlenty of parking with such an urban location. Out front and out back. Prices were pretty good, especially if you stick with the specials!\\n\\nWould I return? Absitively! I am considering volunteering the place for our Tuesday night guy's outing.\\nBest Buy big box store, perhaps a little smaller than some but they still manage to cram all the usual stuff in here. I was looking for a specific widget for my computer, but I didn't manage to find it here. I spent a few extra minutes wandering around but decided that I didn't really need to take a new oven\\n or flat screen TV today. Helpful folks though.\\nYum. I happen to enjoy a little Pinkberry every so often and as I was a little early for my flight, I wandered down the D concourse and found this little spot opposite Gate D3. It's the same great froyo you'll find in their retail locations and it's organized the same too. Pick your size, pick your flavor (or two) and they fill your cup. And then they will put unlimited toppings on top of it for you.\\n\\nFor me, I like the salted caramel yogurt and I like as many of the dry nuts (peanuts, slivered almonds, walnuts, pecans if they have 'em) as will fit.\\n\\nPrices are high, but they're equivalent to their prices out there in the world. Pinkberry ain't cheap.\\nAfter a light dinner elsewhere, I opted to dig into the cheeseburger here at Burgundy Lion. Great service at the bar, and while there's a full selection of spirits, the choices in beers are limited to macros only. It was a great pour of Murphy's, but I really can get Murphy's just about anyw\\nhere.\\n\\nIt's a little loud and the place does get rather busy and that's all great. Neat pub vibe and with TV's tuned to sports, a constant amount of cheering going on.\\n\\nInside and street seating too.\\nPopped in for a shiny bauble for Mrs. K. who deserves it for putting up with me and all of my nonsense. I take pictures of my food. I have to check-in at restaurants on my phone instead of talking with her. I mean, I'm a serious amount of work, you know!\\n\\nThe girl who helped me pick out what I wanted gave great service. I simply gave her an idea of how much I wanted to spend and what I wanted. She knew exactly which counter to head to. And yes, not everything here is a million dollars. There are inexpensive items.\\n\\nNote: When you specify a price range, you'll want to add some windage for the service plan. It's not cheap.\\nI had purchased a poster at the Museum of Art and this UPS is right near the Contemporary Art Museum, so it was a perfect stop to see if they had a shipping tube. And they\", 'actual_label': 6, 'predicted_label': 6}, {'text': ' did! It\\'s a small shop that was quite crowded with boxes when I stopped in, but the gal working the counter was helpful. And my poster survived the journey home!\\nI\\'m an Executive level member of the National Car Rental Emerald Club. That means that I get to bypass the counter and can choose just about any vehicle in the parking area, short of getting a \"Premium.\" The cars on the Executive Row were decent and while I really liked the Charger out there, it had an overwhelming stink of cigarette smoke.\\n\\nI ended up choosing a simple white Nissan Altima which is a four door four cylinder invisible car with local license plate. It had 12500 miles on it, which is high for a rental car from National. It was clean and it drove well, getting reasonable mileage as I tacked on 300 miles between Phoenix and Tucson.\\n\\nGetting out with the car was easy and returning it was similarly easy. I\\'d rent from them again.\\nBig box meets office supplies, the OD also sells office furniture, computers and other \\nelectronics. Prices can be competitive but I wouldn\\'t bet on it. Shop around.\\n\\nHowever if you\\'re looking for supplies, like paper and pens or in my case, binder clips, this is the spot. Staff is friendly and the store is well organized, brightly lit and neatly stocked.\\nSuper huge mega-bookstore, I have to wonder how this place manages to stay open in this modern age of Internet purchasing. It\\'s all so %#@ expensive!\\n\\nThat said, I did need to browse since I didn\\'t know exactly what I wanted (Dutch to English phrase book). I did find two such books and bought both. Thankfully, these are part of a business trip and were therefore expensable. A couple of days later, I decided I didn\\'t need them and returned to the store. No questions, no hassle, I was given an immediate credit back to my corporate card. (Apparently, Dutch pride themselves on their language skills and nearly everyone speaks English.)\\n\\nWould I return? Probably only if I really need something and can\\'t wait for the UPS guy to\\n bring it to me from Amazon.\\nCheap gas in South Carolina. This Circle K is on the south side of the road, which makes it an easy stop when heading back towards the Interstate. Easy in, easy out.\\n\\nNice sized Circle K inside - the clerk was making fresh coffee even at 9:00 at night!\\nCheeseburger cheeseburger coronary coronary. I chose the Nick\\'s Patty Melt which was a fab slab of meat on rye toast with grilled onions and a side of great shoestring fries. Not the healthiest choice (people come here for salads??) but it was massively delicious and filling.\\n\\nDecent beer specials and a few local choices on their menu.\\n\\nParking at lunch time is a major challenge. All I can say is \"Good luck.\"\\nEclectic little spot here in the Plaza Midwood neighborhood. It absolutely has a cool vibe and interesting decor. Very... mingled.\\n\\nI opted for the huevos rancheros and it was different than others I\\'ve had. More like an omelet with grilled chicken, black beans and pepper jack cheese, but topped with pic\\no and sour cream. That\\'s not what I was expecting but it was still very good.\\n\\nMy wife chose the frittata style eggs and didn\\'t enjoy it much. She said that the eggs, with the melted cheddar cheese and the pork sausage, had the texture of shoes. Well, that was a bummer. But the biscuit was good with their table jam on it.\\n\\nBut with that said, we both thoroughly enjoyed the sweet potato hash.\\n\\nSo go with the sweet potato hash and you should be okay!\\nRather than stuff my quota of *$, I opted to hang out here for a bit and it was the right choice. A plethora of comfy seats all with power outlets nearby. A speedy wi-fi, which was very needed for seven people all nursing cups of coffee while surfing the Internet.\\n\\nAs for the brew, wow! That\\'s some excellent coffee! Possibly one of the best cups I\\'ve had since returning to the US. Rich, smooth, tasty!\\n\\nOverhead tunes from one of the local radio stations blocked out the clicking of keyboards and the hum of the cooler, interrupted every so oft\\nen by the bell on the door.\\nLocated airside behind the \"A\" security checkpoint, Red Mango will be competing with another Juice bar in the airport. Like that one, they offer fresh squeezed juices (the gent in front of me got a bottle of fresh OJ), some healthy snack bars and smoothies made to order. The prices here run from medium to high ($11 for a smoothie!!).\\n\\nI chose something with raspberry, mango and orange. This particular flavor is offered in medium (16 ounces for $6) or large (32 ounces for $8) and I chose the smaller one. With most of the counters behind clear glass, you can stand back and watch the folks scooping out your frozen fruits and popping them into the blender. You can also see how clean the place is.\\n\\nThe smoothie was tasty and well blended. By the time I boarded my flight and ordered a pre-departure beverage (hooray, Delta first class), there was enough room for a mini of vodka to be mixed in to make for a proper breakfast.\\nIt\\'s getting so you can\\'t turn around wit', 'actual_label': 6, 'predicted_label': 6}, {'text': \"la Petite Italie, across the street from Triple Crown Dinette. The food was simple but fresh and tasty, we tried the beef and tomato meat balls, the onion bhaji, the mushroom risotto, and the brussels sprouts with pear. The risotto and the meatballs were super delicious, really nice flavours, well cooked, I will crave this and go back for it plus a glass of wine any time. \\n\\nThe beer list was limited to like 4 and not much on it that I like, but the wine and cocktails offered an interesting and affordable selection. \\n\\nThe room is very pretty, warm and well laid-out with a few picnic tables outside, and the staff were friendly, quick and well informed about the food. This place is like an updated family restaurant and a great addition to the neighbourhood.\\nThere is something so nostalgic about taking the train, especially in Canada where so much of our history is bound up with the expansion of railway ties and the possibilities these tracks opened up across our huge spaces.\\n\\nIn Montreal \\nthe Gare Central is a gorgeous, cavernous, partially underground space that is surprising to the first time visitor. You can access it from the Banque Nationale entrance on Rene-Levesque but this is not clearly indicated until you are already through the front door. Taxis come in through the entrance on De La Gauchetiere, and pedestrians can come in that way as well but it's a bit chaotic with all the cars and cabs. \\n\\nOnce inside, the space is so lofty and enormous it's hard to imagine how it all fits under the stately old Queen Elizabeth hotel and bank tower. There is a fairly large food court that connects to the other underground malls and includes a nice mix of smaller cafes and larger chains (the obligatory Tim Hortons, and the slightly unexpected Bureau En Gros.) The large central area where passengers line up to board their trains is all brass and marble and neo-classical art like a good train station should be, and feels like a healthy mix of old timey travel and modern conveni\\nence. \\n\\nThe real standout of the whole experience is the train staff. Everyone from the people at the ticket counters to the porters and conductors are friendly, bilingual, professional, chivalrous and dapper in their trim hats and flapping trench coats. The food on the train is maybe one small notch above most plane food, but the seats and aisles  are much more spacious and the view of rolling farmlands, lakes and small towns is good for the heart, I'm sure of it.\\nLoved to stumble upon this big bright comfy clean cafe today. A friend had messaged me about it saying it was one of her favourite new finds in her neighbourhood, but I hadn't really made a mental note of its location and then BAM, comfy couch beneath me, delicious coffee in hand, amazing smells in the air from the good food cooking, I had found it! And I'll be back for sure. It's spacious and smiley enough that I wouldn't feel bad making good use of the wifi there for a good long while. Plus I love that you can see the big \\nopen kitchen in the back, and I love the pretty wooden rocking horse and other kids toys. Generally a dear spot that I hope experiences all the best success.\\nThis remains a beautiful bar with friendly, talented staff. I was glad to be invited back here recently and reminded of how lovely an experience it can be to sit at the bar beneath the gorgeous blown amber glass lights and drink careful cocktails. With the addition of Kabinet across the street and Sparrow around the corner you have a sweet cocktail scene happening here, which is good for upping everyone's crafty game, and for giving us even more reasons to adventure in the mile end in the evening.\\nWhat I think is great about the Centaur is the effort they make to try and balance the needs of the diverse communities they serve and have served since 1969 - everyone from young theatre innovators to amateur producers and lovers of musicals to season ticket holders who are senior in the community and want to see important groundbreakin\\ng work as well as lighthearted comedy. \\n\\nThe space is wonderful. A short walk toward the Old Port from Place D'Armes metro along the tiny cobblestones of St Francois Xavier brings you to the sudden sense of  open space created by the massive columns of the Centaur Theatre - formerly the Montreal Stock Exchange. The front of house and lobby bar and coat check are all on the ground floor. The bar is big and full of comfy chairs and the staff is generally made up of cool, friendly members of the local arts scene.\\n\\nThe theatres are upstairs, they aren't incredibly spacious in terms of leg room, but they're not airplane-bad. They have a steep rake so pretty much every seat is a good one. About 15 years ago I saw a version of Waiting for Godot here that devastated me, and part of the shock and loveliness of it was that all the curtains and backdrops were removed leaving bare brick walls looming around the actors. The brick is over 100 years old and shows repair, windows bricked in, time pass\", 'actual_label': 7, 'predicted_label': 7}, {'text': 'ing. Something about this one production symbolizes everything I love about the Centaur after 15+ years seeing shows there, maybe something about the willingness to remove all the trappings to create a different kind of magic? Anyway I look forward to the years to come!\\nAnother great stop for when you are eating your way through the market! Because honestly, what else are you doing in the market? Au Pain Doré is the other Quebec bakery chain (other to Premiere Moisson which has it\\'s giant fancy face just across the walkway.) Try croissants from both to compare! I love the cannelé you can sometimes find here, and the mini maple croissants, and the cheddar and rosemary focaccia.\\nVery delicious brunch in the Old Port, with a nice street side patio and friendly service. We thought we were meeting friends upstairs at the rooftop bar but we were relieved to move downstairs when we saw the difference between the menus. Downstairs has a much more detailed menu with more sweet indulgent brunch \\noptions. We shared a cinnamon and bacon bun, a plate of lovely scones with creme fraiche and a mushroom and leek foccacia - all great.\\nQui Lait Cru is French word play that incorporates \\'raw milk\\' (lait cru) into an expression which translates as \"Who would have believed it?\" This bright, open cheese shop in Jean Talon Market specializes in those raw milk cheeses generally only available in Quebec and France. Raw milk aged less than 60 days is legal in Quebec, and carefully monitored. The taste is incredibly fresh and delicious. I have found the staff at Qui Lait Cru very helpful, bilingual and friendly in that chill Quebecois way that doesn\\'t try to shine you on. Sometimes I just describe the mood-flavour I\\'m in and they hook me up (today it was an organic spreadable mild goat cream cheese that is working perfectly with my heirloom tomatoes and ground cherries - delicieux!) There is a daily sampler deal - 3 cheeses selected by the staff for 14$. This is generally a delicious value for\\n the cheese-venturous, and the more senior staff here can even suggest wines to accompany the selections. I think the decor here is intentionally clean, bright and relatively minimal to avoid any thoughts of raw milk making one ill. Most of the cheeses are priced in kilograms, but don\\'t hesitate to ask the staff to give you an idea of prices for your wedges before you buy - they will grab a little red tray for your cheese selections, weigh them out, and help you go all around the counters till you find what you need.\\nI love this place tucked into tiny Gilford and I can\\'t wait till summer comes and this becomes a pedestrian street and Emport Piece can stretch it\\'s sexy skinny jeaned legs out a little further, past the curb, so all the cute kids once cooped up in the window which only seated 4.5 regular sized humans can cheers their grilled cheeses and wine and beerses and dance to the djs late into the night.\\nImportant: All day breakfast. Which we made good use of yesterday at 6pm when \\nmy friend James woke up from an epic sleep free weekend and needed eggs and homefries and a big fat Italian sausage to make everything ok. Bonus for me: licensed. Very cute friendly staff. And a homemade herb pizza dough, just thin and savoury enough to offset the December rain. \\n\\nThe place was empty, dim and cozy when we got there and a few cute couples and families from the area trickled in behind us. The place is full of healthy looking plants which always makes me feel well cared for, and it\\'s quirky-lovingly decorated with that uniquely Quebecois flair. The bathroom is painted like a forest! There is a bit of an off-putting smell down there, which is the only reason this review isn\\'t 4 stars. I am a fan of this local place, and I miss them when they close for seemingly random and extended vacations (but I love that they do this - just adds to the overall feeling of \"we do what we want!\" which I can\\'t help but adore and respect.)\\nReally great addition to Old Montreal for sure! Love\\nd the selection of local beers, the long whiskey list, the incredibly friendly waitress, the patio seating on a quiet section of St Paul. The fish taco I ordered was enormous and fairly tastey, the nacho chips it came with weren\\'t particularly good nor super fresh and the gauc wasn\\'t my favourite flavour either - tasted like mayo or something rather than just fresh chunks of avocado? The crowd was loudly drunken suburbanites screaming along to classic rock, being poured shots by some members of the staff, while our poor waitress tried to smile and negotiate other clients with different interests. No stars off for a bar having drunken clients of course, just mentioning it as a note on the slightly contradictory vibe that seems to be going on here as this sweet new place figures out what it wants to be when it grows up.\\nI mean, this place seems clearly beyond my price point and abilities, but I can dream. There is super high end stuff curated by a team led by a champion triathlete. Top o', 'actual_label': 7, 'predicted_label': 7}, {'text': \"f the line racing bikes and equipment for training throughout the year, high performance clothes and gear. Kind of a museum of modern racing bike tech but yah, you do get the feeling that this stuff is probably not for you, plebe! But I think that vibe - which comes from the gorgeous white space and general gallery feeling - belies a committed staff within who are in fact really open to giving loving care to bikes of all kinds.\\nThis is, in fact, a perfect café. One of those times you don't want to review something because it's precious, but I trust you guys. \\n\\nWe used to bike past the century old shops that stood in this location - a barber shop I believe, next to a tiny hat maker and cordonnerie - and wish it would never change and also think, if it does, I hope someone takes it over who loves this history and treats it right. And when you're here I think you'll feel that justice was done. \\n\\nThe beautiful old cabinets still hold hat molds, the wood and paint and windows are original, \\nand the addition of a beautiful old cafe bar and 50s seating and plateware all make sense. \\n\\nEven better, the food and service maintain the link to Italian Montreal history and hospitality. Old gents sit at the bar trading stories of vintage finds they've brought back for the young owner. Beautiful cappuccinos, delicious cookies and pastries are served along with glorious big sandwiches on crusty fluffy Italian bread that will break your heart. \\n\\nThe space is tiny. Don't come here to do group work. It's on a leafy residential street far from sightseeing; this is not a destination. This is just a perfect neighourbood café, and I'm so glad they still make 'em like this.\\nTwo floors of fun home decor stylings in the Mile End / Plateau. There is a mix of imports and some Canadian made and locally made goods, though it does seem to be mostly imports. You've got your nice cushion covers, planters, lights, door knobs and hooks, cups, candles, etc. As well as some great looking bags. Recently m\\ny sister was looking for pretty decorative pulls to use on a dresser she was refinishing (great work kid.) She checked 8 different shops in the area and was so happy with what she finally found here at V de V, they are heavy, white and black, elaborate and great. Pricey but perfect, which pretty much sums up the few things I've found here.\\nTiny pretty spot on the Promenades St Hubert jam-fricken-packed with local goodness. The beer fridge is glorious: try the 3 Mousquetaires world award-winning port stout if you like dark beers, or ask the friendly (handsome) bilingual gent for suggestions. There is a small section of cheeses, pate, honeys and other local products that change a bit with the seasons. This is a great place to sample and support locally made products, and definitely at the top of my list for gift giving.\\nReally chill, red, wood, velvet and brassey - a bar where it's possible to get a nice port and sometimes catch some interesting new jazz or funk or electro soul. Just off\\n St Denis in a squat old stone building, the Latin Quarter pub manages to be both young and classy at same the time (tough to pull off.) The service is always calm, friendly and competent and it's nice to sit here summer or winter with some charcuterie and an old friend, moving slow.\\nBetween the free-to-the-public parts of the gardens (which is everything outdoors in the warm summer evenings) and the expanse of Parc Maisonneuve across the street there are huge areas to explore in this area on the cheap if you're not up for the entrance fee. The metro lets you out half a block away and you get a great view of the big O from the walk up. The sculptures alone are worth a mosey and think, not to mention the hundreds of kinds of (ahhhhhh) green.\\nJust updating this because everyone here is the best. I went in recently kind of freaked out (as usual) and the hygienist Jessica was amazing. She put down all the tools and took the time to explain to me exactly why I didn't need to be afraid, and \\nmore about how teeth and roots and gums work than anyone has bothered to explain to me before. She dug into drawers to find a flavour of the fluoride stuff that wouldn't make me gag (orange! changed my life!) And generally didn't make me feel judged, just laughed and made me feel comfortable. \\n\\nAlso, Doctor Kordlouie is the best dentist. Not just because of the hilarious jokes and taste in music, but because he is constantly going out of his way to learn more about the science of dentistry from all over the world. He doesn't judge dentists who charge extra for first visits or for xrays, but that's not his style so it's more affordable than other spots. And he doesn't jump right into surgery, he likes to show you where the problem areas are and coach you how to take care of your teeth, and keep an eye on it for a couple months before deciding if fillings are necessary. Just generally wanted to reiterate that I'm so so so happy to have found this dental practice.\\nJoin my voice to the cho\", 'actual_label': 7, 'predicted_label': 47}, {'text': \"rus, what a nice experience!

Take a photo of the blackboards on your way in to read at your seat and leisure, one is entirely delicious food and the other is wine by the bottle, but really based on my experience your best bet is just chatting with the amazing wait staff about what you feel like eating and what they are excited to be serving that night and you won't be led astray. \\n\\nJust down the street from Joe Beef and Liverpool this lovely little slip of a room is tasteful and perfect and calm and bright and I love it. Expensive but not crazy and so totally worth it when every bite is dreamy. I'll be back for sure.\\nI trust Chris B on these\\n types of things, so his glowing review plus Jason L's description of these 'sexy magical strands' had me aching to try Nudo. We hit it up on January First (I love you for being open right off the bat) and were gleefully not disappointed. The noodles are in fact pulled fresh before your eyes and are soft, plump, perfect, and the broth on my beef flank noodle soup was swoon-worthy. Lots of perfectly mouth-watering beef, crisp lovely veg and a quantity so pleasingly hearty I have noodle soup calling my name from the fridge as we speak. My dinner dates were all delighted as well, including the vegan who was able to swap the chicken broth for all veg (though her soup could have had more veg in it, actually. Load up our animal-loving friends when you can restauranteurs, they are hungry!) We tried 7 different salads, each at about $1.50 a pop, and they were all tasty - the cucumber, radish and potato salads were the table favourites. \\n\\nAll this good eating, plus a beer, and we walked out eac\\nh paying under $20 including tax and tip. Super homerun win of a way to ring in 2013.\\nMy witchy friend pointed this spot out to me, I must have walked by it a thousand times without noticing this tucked away piece of magic on St.Denis. The variety of quality stones in here is remarkable, tiny stacks on every available surface. There are also white and pink salt and crystal lamps, singing bowls, totem stones and a couple pretty pillows to round out the mix. There's also a lovely collection of turquoise and amber and silver jewelry. The service was warm and kind a no pressure. Happy to have discovered Pierre's D'ailleurs!\\nWas in the area and starving this weekend, tried to go to the Patisserie Rhubarbe sugar shack but they ran out of sandwiches and we were too hungry to wait in line for just sweets, and there was a line at Byblos too, and just when things looked hangry and grim: Yelp to the rescue. We found it on the app, and popped around the corner into this unmarked, tiny, bright litt\\nle room. We were served hot almond milk chai as soon as we sat down, and then we devoured incredibly tart and delicious rhubarb French toast, salmon gravlax, goat cheese and wild mushroom omelettes, yogurt with homemade granola, all so good and healthy and chill and friendly. A great find, not fancy, no room for crowds, just a few round wooden tables and a calm smiling vibe.\\nI can't believe I haven't reviewed the Moonbean, in some ways I kind of grew up here. My dad's house was around the corner and this was his office in the mornings (often the Last Temp was the office in the late afternoons, the other half of home.) There are big fresh thermoses of fair trade coffee always on offer, and great baked goods from around the neighbourhood and filling, tasty, inexpensive breakfast options - the toasted bagel with fresh cream cheese and piles of chopped veggies is a personal timeless favourite. The back patio is chill, and the front patio is action-packed and friendly with lots of conversat\\nion cross pollination between tables.\\nLove this beautiful mellow bar with it's stained glass and thick deco wood and high white ceilings and gorgeous old moldings everywhere. There are small cozy corner booths, and the bar is a v-shaped point in the back. There is a small raised stage at the front that works for smaller bands, and the sound in the room is quite warm and great. Pints are affordable, service comes to the tables or you can work your way in to the bar. I've seen some great shows here over the years, the folks doing the booking are doing lots right. All in all a wonderful room on St Denis.\\nDic Ann's is a Quebec classic and this is one of the very best in my opinion. I think it was actually opened by the franchise owners in the 90's but the vibe is perfect, homey 60's small town diner. A tribute to the original couple, Dick and Ann, who fell in love and dreamed of opening a hamburger spot and moved to Montreal's east end in the 50s and made their dream come true.

We went in, my Icelandic friend and I, after Iceland lost their last epic game in their amazing run at the World Cup this summer. \\n\\nFrom the beginning the guys at the meat counter we\\'re super friendly and helpful and we started chatting with more of the staff as we grabbed all kinds of delicious dips and other things while the super fresh and super affordable meat was prepped. At the cash 3 different older men engaged is in a passionate and kindly conversation about how far Iceland h\\nad come, how they should be so proud, etc. It was really funny and kind. Did I mention we were wearing face paint. That may have played a role.\\nHoly delicious. My lord. Quasi religious experience. We were trying to have a semi-worky meeting but we needed to repeatedly sit in silence with our eyes half closed thinking about the miracle that is challah french toast with fried chicken... because this is like no french toast I\\'ve ever tried, more like giant light piece of challah dipped in donut batter and lightly fried to the consistency of funnel cake and or dreams. Perfect perfect perfect chicken breast. Tiny little bottle of syrup on the plate (who doesn\\'t awww for teeny tiny glassware? people who are dead inside, probably.) \\n\\nClean simple comfortable decor in this unobtrusive semi-basement on Monkland. Very sweet and prompt staff, affordable prices that will have me journeying across town to brunch here often.\\nJust a heads up that Blackstrap started delivery today! \"3$ à Verdun, St. H\\nenri, Pte. St. Charles, Lasalle, Côte St. Paul et 4$ à l\\'Île-des-Soeurs.\"\\n\\nBring more BBQ north next please!!!\\nWhat an enormous crazy labyrinth of a building! I suppose this was a factory of some sort... ahem, quick Google suggests that yes! This was a factory built in the 1880s to make textiles that at one point employed over 3000 people. Then it was a toy factory where they made Pong! Over the decades a lot of the original building was covered up but a restoration project focused on the original plans and the Chateau now stands as an impressive wall of 19th red stone. It houses lofts, offices, a restaurant and more and it\\'s an easy place to get lost in for sure, but the getting lost leads out onto wide wooden hallways, and looming glass doorways the open out onto surprising stone courtyards. I think this could be an amazing space for all kinds of big and small events..  A place I intend to spend more time discovering, but maybe I\\'ll wait till summer..\\nSpacious and comfortable for sur\\ne, with a friendly smiling quick draw waitress slinging some power cocktails (and some things that are perhaps more accurately qualified as draaanks.) They will add a second shot to a list of special cocktails for free for you before 9pm, and $11 pitchers is pretty cheap on this street. The art is cool, and I love the giant communal wood table up front. Was only here for a quick whiskey on a long night ramble but left with warm and fuzzies and will be back soo surely!!\\nMaybe not exceptionally authentic Cambodian and Vietnamese food, but this place was packed at lunch on a weekday for a reason. You know when you eat something and you can tell that all the vegetables are fresh, the meat is quality and well cooked, and things generally taste like they were prepared with care? You get that feeling from the food here, plus there are like 30 items on a $9 lunch menu. Voici crowds. \\n\\nI was seated and served with kindness and in a prompt but not overly speedy manner, never felt rushed, and the\\n rate food came out at made it seem clear that each meal was being cooked to order. I had a bowl of Tom Yam soup, the vegetarian one, it was like $4 and big and perfectly flavourful and full of fresh veggies. I also had the spicy beef and rice - incredibly tender beef, not all that spicy, but very nice. \\n\\nIt\\'s a nice looking room, cosy, and the business is run by what seems like a family. All in all I think the Regal on St Hubert deserves the loyal local lunch crowd it\\'s earned, and I suspect I\\'ll be back, especially to take advantage of the BYO on some cold winter night sometime soon.\\nReally nice quality secondhand, and you can sell here too! They have clear rules about what you can bring in, so the place isn\\'t overloaded with fast fashion cast offs. Clean and bright and stylish with lots of cozy sweaters in the winter and little dresses in the summer and a pretty big collection of on trend boots and shoes in the back.\\nAw man you gotta pass by here and say hi to Jesus and try these de', 'actual_label': 7, 'predicted_label': 7}, {'text': \"licious, totally homemade tacos direct from his hometown of Monterey Mexico! Jesus is so passionate about what he does, and so excited, it's totally contagious. The vibe in here is completely welcoming and warm, everyone felt like a regular when we were here and they've only been open for a couple weeks. \\n\\nI'm eating veg these days so I can tell you, the Monterey Vegetarian with marinated mushrooms and crispy melts cheese is excellent, especially when slathered with the homemade avocado hot sauce. At 4 for $10 they are a perfect lunch.\\n\\nApparently the smoked meat taco has nothing to do with Montréal smoked meat and everything to do with Sundays back home, so go try that and report back!!!\\nWell, Rachel's review is hilarious and that would merit one star from me as well, but just to add my recent experience: I called Taxi Champlain to get a pickup on a corner where I was stuck with a large amount of stuff I couldn't carry. The dispatcher told me he couldn't send a cab without an address \\nthen HUNG UP ON ME. So I called Diamond and the dispatcher was super nice and friendly, said no problem he'd send someone to the corner and when the car arrived it was in way better condition than cars I'd had recently from Champlain, the driver helped me load and unload all my stuff and he had a *gasp* professional gps and credit/debit machine. I'll be calling these guys first next time... though maaaybe not for an airport run. ;)\\nUpdate: they swapped our leftovers. Handed it to us saying what they were, and they were wrong. No biggie for me because full disclosure, I ate the vegan's soup, and I liked it. Probably less fun for her though. \\n\\nNot removing a star because this in no way detracts from the joy and wonder of the food. Just a heads up to double check your cartons.\\nWell located with the connection from inside Berri Metro, easy to navigate around to find your bus, comfortable and clean waiting areas, and in my experience friendly and functionally bilingual staff. There's an old\\n school cafe in here with some toxic coffee, but this sort of goes with the territory, no?\\nI just need to reiterate, having been this week, that this is possibly the best BBQ in the city. It's a close compete with Triple Crown but it's so different and far away  there's no need to fight. The burnt ends poutine is one of my all time favourite things, and the fact that I'm currently eating the leftovers for breakfast should confirm that diagnosis. \\n\\nThey also have Creemore springs on tap, and a few local bottled beers. The ribs and chicken wings and hot sauce are all exceptional, dry and vinagery and moist like crazy and the room is chill, not trying to be anything but still good looking and there are a few picnic tables outside to enjoy the thrum of life happening on Wellington.\\n3+ years seems like a good time for an update, even if it's just to report that the stars have remained the same. I've come to love Odessa like family. Quiet little spot always striving for both friendly and exc\\nellent. I buy a bag of fresh beans here every week to make at home and still come in for meetings or quiet work all the time. I don't love espresso based drinks but they are excellent here, and the pour over and small fresh pots of filter coffee are just exceptional. They manage to balance all the layered uniqueness of lightly roasted craft coffee with an appreciation for the bitter buttery chocolatey comfort that draws people to coffee in the first place. They make delicious homemade chai and serve perfect pots of looseleaf tea, and earlier this year they partnered with one of the absolute best bakeries in town, Rhubarbe, to get batters which they bake fresh each morning so they can offer a small and delectable selection of hot muffins and cakes pretty much all day. \\n\\nMost importantly, the owners and staff are the best people and I'm so have they are the people in my neighbourhood.\\nOriginally a vaudeville theatre built in 1914, the Imperial is a Historic Monument owned by a non-profit\\n organization and is the homebase for many film festivals that come through town. Watching a film here feels like a classy, out of time event. The lobby, the gorgeous ceiling, the balcony, all softly swoon worthy - the restoration was award-winning for a reason. It's wonderful that this place survived so many decades of change and offers such a soul-soothing space to experience the magic of movies. But they just don't show enough of them! The schedule should be packed, as far as I'm concerned, with the best modern and historic cinema has to offer, but all too often it sits empty waiting to be rented out for events. I think you could fill this place 3 times a day with creative programming involving the local university film programs and art galleries... just sayin.\\nThis place keeps saving my life downtown when all I want is good food, a pint, a whisky, an intimate talk with good friends...

It's small, and not cheap but not over priced, fully bilingual, bathrooms are downstairs and awfully close to the kitchen, but otherwise tasteful. In this area it's nice to tuck off St Cat's into a place that's not a chain, not a scene, nice looking enough to feel like your life is unfolding beautifully with choices that aren't too bad at all.\\nI'm torn about this one. A friend picked it, it was perfect location for the group that was meeting. It is a beautiful sexy dim room and the service was so kind and quick and helpful. We arrived a good 40 minutes before our reservation and they didn't bat an eye, just welcomed the early birds and quickly brought us drinks. \\n\\nWhen I looked at the prices on the food menu I was kind of furious, these prices are jumped up even for Westmount and it bothers me that people pay for it. I was hungry but could not bring myself to pay $30-$50 for pasta or a taco platter. We had a dozen oysters at over $2 an oyster and there was she\\nll in 2 of the 4 I tried. I really don't mind paying for an amazing meal at all, but this bugged me. \\n\\nI ended up ordering off the apps menu, ordered the fish tacos, and here I was pleasantly surprised. The tacos came out quick and they were fat, filling and fabulous. \\n\\nThe vibe was surprisingly cosy and friendly, we ended up staying late, laughing with the staff and drinking delicious cava. I'm hesitating between 3 and 4 stars, but the oysters are really stuck in my craw so I'm docking a star, but if I had the right occasion I'd be happy to come back and give it another shot.\\nI have been back here a couple times since my initial review and after today I need to update my rating, I am definitely out of the armoire and officially a fan. They now roast their own nuts and make their own fresh fruit purees for their gelatos and the flavours are super complex and interesting and so so good. The dragon bowl had the fat Israeli couscous that I love and all these lightly pickled veggies - and \\nI know that it's weird to go from talking about delicious locally made gelato to coucous, but that is what make this sweet little spot on the cool low end of St Hubert Promenade so great: crazy tasty healthy meals like burritos and grilled cheese alongside homemade softserve and gelato. They make the classic gelato flavours all the time, including a heart warming dark chocolate, and then they play around with some innovative heart breakers like my new beloved, the smoked pine. L'Armoire is my new favourite lunch place in the neighbourhood and a super sweet addition to the Montreal frozen sweets scene. \\n\\nOh and to update my old review - they do have a bathroom, it's in the back. They make their espresso gelato using Dispatch coffee instead of St Henri now and the organe and lemon gelatos are crazy punchy and flavourful now that they are 100% made in house with real fruit.\\nLots of flights to and from Montreal get routed through this much larger hub, so I end up here on the semi-regular. \\nI find it super confusing. It's so enormous (air-hangar high ceilings) and the signs telling you where to go seem to get lost in the wash of mega visual stimuli and I always get turned around. This is not something that happens to me in every big airport, even in Shanghai I found it fairly easy to follow signs to figure out where to be. I think it takes a special kind of designer to get these cues right, I don't think we do a great job of it in Montreal either tbh. \\n\\nI also find it strange that if you are at Pearson for a layover you are forced out of the gate area and you have to do security and everything all over again. This must make for a lot of unnecessarily stressed out people, non? \\n\\nOn the upside, everyone who I've ever dealt with who worked here was super kind, and conscientiously bilingual, and able to deal with passenger panic/rage with a gentleness and a sense of humour that I wholeheartedly admire. 5 stars for those guys.\\nDig this place for the packed terrace in the summe\\nr, but maybe even more so for a cozy mellow midweek 5a7 on the black couches when it's cold out. Very friendly, very bilingual staff who are relaxed and know their business, and who will sometimes surprise you with a uke story if the mood is just right. They do a nice latte here too and I appreciate the dark but clean, classy but not fancy vibe.\\nVieux Velo's chic new next door sister. Excellent coffee in a pretty white light space. A latte here costs more than at the coffee places locals here are used to, Italia, Olympico, etc so we'll see whether the coffee culture in town can sustain it, but for myself I'm really happy to have new options of all kinds popping up in my neighborhood. I'll still choose Italia for many of my sitting in my community getting caffeinated needs, but Odessa wins on a couple of points - I prefer the eco takeout cups to the styrofoam at Italia (the squeak between my teeth is uber-cringe-y.)

The chairs and tables remind me of a bar/cafe place I used to hang out at when I was around high school age (but legal, obvi) and I thought maaaan, I would hang out here all the time if I was a kid these days, and as a kid at heart I\\'ll be back for sure. \\n\\nThe fries were skinny and salty, the staff was totally nice and bilingual without even a hint of the snark I sometimes associate (to my error, clearl\\ny) with high level nerdom. There were 2 interesting beers on tap and lots of funny fruity cocktails with geek-referential names. The games are free so we could play some racing game (and by \"racing\" I do mean spinning endlessly in circles and driving into walls) and Mortal Kombat (which a friend had when I was a kid and brings out a not-entirely-attractive murderous glee in me) and then hang out with a bigger group and play Cards Against Humantity.  The company was top notch and I was super glad they led me to discover this odd basement oasis amidst the chain boutiques of St Catherine.\\nThe beautiful new space is right around the corner and totally lovely!

Perfect lobster tail - I only risk ordering this when I think there\\'s a very high probability it will be perfect and it was, oh yes it was. Most of the manly men at our table ordered the roast beef and appeared gleeful at the size and flavour of the great beast that came.

There are also these delicious sounding salads on the menu that are served up in single, double or 4 person portions which I will totally go back for. There seems to be a rotating selection of house organic wines on offer along with a couple ok beers. \\n\\nThere was no cocktail menu available despite my super kind and funny waitress asking around for one for me. The other t\\nhing I found off-putting was the insistent way another staff members swept all around me, not making eye contact with me, while I sat there breathing dust. Personally I'd say: hey maybe skip sweeping a table if it's already occupied and focus on making customers feel comfortable. The rest of the staff did this is spades, they were funny, easy-going, chill. I think this is a new place working some kinks out but an exceptional addition to the downtown options.\\nWhile Crescent area can be cringe-worthy, I had a lovely mello time here indoors with the graceful and charming Rawan K, and then outdoors wondering about the women of Wanda's (strip club upstairs) with a brat pack of hawt Yelpers on the sidewalk tables. The macarons were light and lovely (especially the chocolate and coffee ones, yum) and they did in fact pair well with wine and whiskey.  The sandwich I ordered was just okay, and when it was taken away to be doggy-bagged up it never returned. Also: slow jazz. You always lose one s\\ntar for slow jazz. That's the rule. ;)\\nJust a classic Montreal Italian diner. With booths and big windows looking out on grey avenue des Pins. Everything here today feels clean, the food is fresh and no fuss and the waitress is chill and feels like she's probably related to Mamma. There are a few tables of area regulars eating lasagne and pizza and fish and chips, but they serve breakfast till 3pm so my two eggs come out quick and with no judgement but with perfect golden potatoes crispy but not greazy on the outside, fluffy on the inside and a fresh slice of tomato and pineapple and some baked beans on the side. Simple and filling and fast. Plastic table mats and you pay at the counter and you're back running errands on lower Main in no time.\\nI noticed a while back that below the back counter they have bags of Caffè Italia home roast espresso beans. $14 for a chic little white bag of hefty nutty flavor, these beans make some good brew. This is now my caffeination of choice - fresh gro\\nund at home and bubbled up in my caffettiera on the stove top, it's like having Italia in my apartment any time I like. Minus the swarthy, serious baristos. \\n\\nSidenote: the Mayor of Montreal walked in here the other day followed by a photographer, shook everyone's hand while the pap snapped and left quick. Paying homage to the real powers that be in MTL? Maybe! Looking for a friendly neighborhoody photo op while dealing with ongoing student strikes? Golly gee, seems likely.\\nThis is the cheaper of the fish shops in the market and everything in my experience has been fresh and excellent. A good spot to grab giant scallops or organic salmon or white fish or, on special days outside on the terrace, fresh oysters or lobster rolls.

Sometimes you forget to review a place because it's been a part of your life and your love for a city for so long it's like a second skin. And then you meet a friend for a pint, and you are the first people there when it opens, and you get that small table in the front that basks in the sun, and you drink some of the best beer made in this province, and in the country.

It's quick to Lionel Groulx (about 15 minutes barring traffic, which could more than double it.) Hop off at Lionel metro if you need to get anywhere on the west side, orange or green metro lines meet here. Or stay on board, it's just another ten minutes or so to Berri, and the 747 makes several stops downtown along the way if that's where you need to be.

Bumpin and cozy during 5a7, unpretentious and friendly like a brewpub should be and the homebrews have nice flavour. I've been disappointed tasting that hint of bleach from recently (and poorly) cleaned taps in lots of other joints, but not here. The house stout is not too sweet, light coffee notes, my favourite. \\n\\nFree wifi with my beer is much appreciated, as is that magical lighting level where everyone looks a little romantic but you can still read from your screen if you like. I like the big comfy chairs in the front window and the long communal tables in the back by the bar. The terrasse doesn't do much for me, but it's nice that it exists. The snacks are fine, not cra-mazing but plenty fine and a step above bar food for sure.\\nLovely, simple cafe decor, great spot near mount royal park to bring a laptop and do some quiet work. I loved the healthy smoothy with berries he\\nre, and the grilled cheese with caramelized onions, and that mystery muffin that the waiter was unable to identify. The soup of the day was watery and a bit disappointing. The staff is a little haphazard and sometimes slow, but always smiley. The homemade truffles display is adorable.\\nLes Trois Minots is quite warm and pretty actually, and it's got some good heart. The space is located on the main drag of St Laurent Boulevard, it looks closed up but it opens whenever they have shows booked and the clamped down exterior belies the well-lit coziness within. I wish it could be open as a bar and performance space all week long, but I understand there could be lots of reasons why this might not be feasible. Size-wise it fills a gap in our salle de spectacles options - it feels fine and cozy with 50 but can squeeze over 200 to even 300ish I suspect (don't ask me if I know this for a fact, gosh officer I couldn't tell you.) As a show space it's got a lot going for it - nice high stage in the \\nback of the room facing the door, another high raised area near the door so folks in the back have an excellent view, plenty of seating, all good sight lines, and layout-wise it seems easy for the sound tech to do a good job. Prices for renting the space are negotiable and fair.\\nJust updating because it's been years and I still love this bar. Caveat though, I know when not to come. This bar is wildly popular and sometimes I just don't bother, there are some great other local beer options these days that are less on the beer tourism route and though they all seem to do well, this one is all-too-often way too packed for me. \\n\\nBut in the summer they open at 11:30am. You can get a delicious vegan board for lunch - like a cheese or charcuterie board but all delicious spreads and nuts and breads and pickles. You can snag a spot on the patio and spend the afternoon sampling incredible beers, laughing with the friendly funny staff and soaking in the beautiful bike friendly life of Laurier in t\\nhe Plateau. If you can do this, you should. After all these years, still fully a 5 star experience.\\nThis is the original Ye Old Orchard and though they've opened 2 or 3 other locations  it's still held on to the original quality and mellow vibe and remained a great local NDG pub. Doesn't feel cold or commercial or dirty or dark, it sits in the clean cozy warmly lit place in the middle. Ye serves better than average pub food with better than average service, in kilts! I do love an Irish pint and some hot wings from a man in a skirt.\\nI had a cocktail and a cheese plate here recently and they were both excellent, and I noticed a couple other things I thought maybe worth mentioning. For one, 6pm and the place started to fill up with families! In a high end bistro with a big central bar this wasn't really something I was expecting, I hadn't realized this Brasserie had a kids menu! Let alone a well developed menu clearly devoted to kids' taste with mini burgers, mac n' cheese, fish n' chips,\", 'actual_label': 7, 'predicted_label': 7}, {'text': 'tea bag with some hot water and honey is still one of the most flawless concoctions of all time. So I\\'m not really that annoyed about their simple approach to the world\\'s most popular beverage. \\n\\nTheir sandwich selection is good, and a half is plenty. They put a bit of mustard in their egg salad, which is really zesty and fun. Just like me. \\n\\nWHO THE HELL IS PEPPER?\\nThe Roastery is conveniently located near almost every hip office building in the city, including my old stomping grounds at Movember HQ. I\\'ve probably frequented this unique coffee/snack venue about 20 times. \\n\\nI\\'d often grab one of their special pasta salads, coffee and/or a sandwich. I was partial to their egg salad, which is made to order. The servers were always generous with the toppings and genuinely lovely.\\n\\nMUST MENTION: In the summertime you can take your food to go and go to the stunning rooftop garden and check-out the Toronto skyline (while avoiding going back to work, perhaps).\\n\\nTIP: Order their lentil soup. I\\nt\\'s delicious and hearty enough to be a good wintertime meal. *Not always veggie based, so look out if you don\\'t eat meat. \\n\\nGOTTA LOVE: Free wifi.\\nBefore I dive in here, I need to say that I\\'ve never set foot in this restaurant. My husband was on a suburban man-date, and I asked him to bring me home some take out. I did eat their delicious noodles and soup, so I\\'m going to go ahead and share my Hakka tale! \\n\\nI texted my man and asked him to bring home some food for me, too, and I was delighted when I found out he was heading for Hakka. I love Hakka food. I\\'m ignorant to the exact details, but it\\'s my understanding it\\'s curry-infused Chinese from a specific region with really delicate flavours. He brought me home a huge portion of Hakka noodles and a hot and sour soup, both were delicious and massive. I was worried he\\'d over spent \"how much was this?\" \\n\\n$5.50.\\n\\nYes, that beautiful number gets its own paragraph. Between 11am and 3pm you get one huge item plus a soup for $5.50. Now that\\'\\ns one hell of a lunch special, especially since it was so large it stretched through lunch, dinner and a midnight snack.\\nReturned here on a whim for cozy date night, and we had an alright time. \\n\\nAlas, in the winter without the people-peeping patio, this place is more like an upscale French diner than it is a romantic restaurant. \\n\\nLoud clattering kitchen and a few patrons make up the interior on any given night. There\\'s candlelight, but it\\'s a little too bright to require it. I feel like thanking the cook for a laugh, too. You, sir, are a mediocre singer, but I really enjoyed your BSB renditions. Perhaps, however, consider the patrons and keep it down just a little? Most folks don\\'t love 90s boy band tune-age as much as I. \\n\\nFood is still tasty, and French wine is never bad.\\nYou can get a king room here with a great CN tower view and incredible cable for under $200. \\n\\nI\\'m a huge proponent of the staycation, so recently instead of going out for an expensive dinner, or hanging out in ou\\nr not-quite-assembled apartment we checked into the Sheraton Centre, and it was totally fine and we had a lovely time. \\n\\nMy only issue is that this is convention central, so if friends were coming to town I\\'d probably recommend somewhere a little more quaint. This and no robes. I just really like hotel robes, soft and bleached. Gimme, Sheraton! Gimme!\\nYe Ol\\' Vic. \\n\\nI have many memories of guzzling reasonably priced craft beers on the massive wood-lined corner patio of the Victory Café. They always stay open until 3am, and let you order multiple drinks at last call. \\n\\nThe food is decent, I\\'m a fan of their mac and cheese, which comes with a side caesar salad. \\n\\nThe bathrooms are pretty gross, but in a remarkable change of pace, are UPstairs and not in a basement.\\n\\nThe servers really don\\'t give a shit, but as a regular, I find it endearing. You likely will not. \\n\\nPEPPER POINTS: For changing up their beer selection seasonally. I like pumpkin ales, no matter what you say about them.\\nHi, I\\'\\nm Evelyn. I love weird, divey places. Nice to meet you. Hooray. \\n\\nI don\\'t want to mislead you into thinking this place is great if you don\\'t also like weird, so I\\'m going to go with three A-OK stars for On The Rocks. It seems to me most every night is Karaoke night, and it\\'s pretty empty but the drinks are cheap, the whole place smells like delicious mozza sticks and the servers are very pleasant. \\n\\nGet riled up, and if you\\'re on an accidental drink crawl in the east end, be sure to add this to your list, and bring the house down with some Oasis.\\nMy mother is a farmer. \\n\\nOK, that sounds super badass, buuuut I\\'m lying. She\\'s a retired editor and professor turned gardening nut. She slowly vamped her big backyard into a garden, then into her main food source and finally into an urban farm with its bounty available at a farmers\\' market in Cobourg, ON. \\n\\nWhat do you buy a farmer at Christmas? Farming things. Duh. After you buy the usual pair of earrings and funky reading glasses, the only t', 'actual_label': 8, 'predicted_label': 8}, {'text': 'hing left for this lady is gardening goods. We know she had her heart set on a seeder, so we popped into Lee Valley to get her a gift card. If I ever start gardening, or need some fancy hardwares for my house, I know I will be returning to this sleek outdoorsy mecca.\\nThe Keg. A Canadian institution. \\n\\nI popped in here last night for a family dinner, and everyone thoroughly enjoyed their meal. I\\'m not one for chains, especially when it comes to meat, but damn it all. The Keg just knows how to cook a steak. Everyone around me went for a separate cut of meat done differently, and everyone practically licked their plate clean. I strayed from the carnivores and had a french onion soup followed by a lobster tail and I have no complaints. The Poutine Of Soups and the King Of Crustaceans are a match made in heaven. \\n\\nFor a chain, this place sure does add up... but with the dark, sleek interior and well-cooked meat, this Keg location is worth the splurge once in a while.\\nThe second location of \\nHanji is just as lovely as the original gangsta in Koreatown. \\n\\nI was in here recently looking for boxes of thank you cards. Alas, they didn\\'t have what I was looking for, but I should have known better. Hanji is all about beautiful one offs and delicious DIY goods, not about mass produced products. \\n\\nEven though they didn\\'t have what I was after, I still took the time to get lost in their little second location. I was gently guided by their super friendly staff through delicate and awesome things piled on top of each other. I\\'m especially fond of their pop up cards. So cute!\\nI have nothing but glowing things to say about the atmosphere and food at Chiado. The ambiance is slightly dated, but in that wonderful high-end steak house way. The Portuguese seafood is beautiful, and absolutely worth the price tag. \\n\\nI came in recently for a holiday lunch with a couple of friends, and they had the fish specials, and I had the lobster bisque and goat cheese veggie tower. Again, everything was in\\ncredibly delicious. I\\'m hesitant to say anything about the service here, because many of the gentleman on the floor here are professional, kind and fun. Alas, this was one of those situations where I can\\'t rise above...\\n\\nOur server was the pits. \\n\\nI think he didn\\'t love us because we weren\\'t ordering bottles of wine, and were slightly younger than the average Chiado patron, but beyond his snideness, he was also just super annoying. He really felt he knew better than we did about what we wanted when it came to course timing, seating arrangements and pretty much everything else involved in the meal. He was very annoying, and next time I\\'m there (and I will be back!), I\\'m going to request another server\\'s section. When you\\'re spending over $100 on lunch, there\\'s no time for nonsense.\\nLe Gourmand est delicieux. \\n\\nI used to work across from Le Gourmand, and on the not-so-rare occasion when I would choose to splurge and gorge myself at lunchtime, I\\'d hop across the street and choose from the\\nir adorable chalkboard menu. I still hunt out their lattes when I\\'m in the hood.\\n\\nThey always have lots of hot specials along with a variety of salads, quiches and sandwiches. I am a big fan of the ham and cheese quiche and beet salad. They also make nice pasta and pot pie specials. Delish.\\n\\nThis joint doubles as a small french grocer and cafe, and makes a great latte. Which is good, because after a carbo-load I can really use some caffeine. Ya feel me? \\n\\nI usually take things to go but they do have small bistro-style tables along the edges of the interior. \\n\\nPEPPER POINTS: For when they have their Mac and Cheese special. Gourmet Mac and Cheese is the best.\\nQueen Video is going to be the last man standing when it comes to DVD/Blue Ray rental, and they deserve it. Their three locations are all Toronto staples, but this one in The Annex is my favourite. \\n\\nGreat selection of New Releases, Art Films and everything in between. Though it has to be noted that sometimes they sort of shame you \\nwhen you rent a Sandra Bullock movie. Not that I\\'d ever do that. \\n\\nPEPPER POINTS: For figuring out how to stay alive in the face of Netflix. I heard they are thinking about expanding to Cabbagetown. Good on you, Queenie.\\nI\\'ve been here a few times since my last review, and though I\\'m still pro Saint, I think there\\'s been a minor taint. \\n\\nThe prices here are fairly high, excluding their oyster deals, thus the servers must make decent coin. So, like, why so sour? I\\'m not one to bitch about service on the regular. I\\'m talking about *four* visits where I was made to feel like I was an inconvenience for coming in to eat, drink, be merry and spend my hard-earned twoonies. . \\n\\nSteak, bubbly and Malbecs remain divine. Giant booths still pop my top.\\n\"I didn\\'t get your toothbrushes in the end. They were $23 for four.\" -Man I live with.\\n\\n\"I know what they cost.

Kudos to Toronto for finally having this large Muji location, their first one was simply too small.\\nComrade: an intimate friend or associate, a fellow soldier. \\n\\nMy fellow soldier, Matt M and I, got very intimate with the food and drinks... and more drinks (...and then they just charged us for the bottle) at Comrade last night. It was a lovely evening and the staff were superb. \\n\\nFor a Tuesday night they were pretty busy, and there was only one server and one bartender. Kudos to the whole staff for being so grand whilst being so slammed.\\n\\nI had the deviled eggs followed by the tacos and Matt had the hot dogs. Everything was delicious. The menu has a Korean twist to it, which at first seemed out of place, but the flavors were creative.\\n It worked. Koren? Russian? Pub? It\\'s everything in a darkened, drunk package. \\n\\nThe bartender makes a good bourbon sour, and the sauv by the glass is good. They keep it really cold. I like that. \\n\\nPEPPER POINTS For having Chess for the patrons to play in the back. \\n\\nPEPPER\\'S PISSED: There were these film dudes doing script edits at the table next to us. They are making the worst RomCom of all time and think they\\'re fucking Woody Allen. But we had fun mocking them. So maybe I wasn\\'t so pissed... but ugh. You know the type.\\nThis one goes out to the ladies. \\n\\nToday I sheepishly went in for my first Brazilian in years. Like a lot of years. Like too many years. Anyway, I started off by apologizing to Meg (a true wax goddess, we\\'ll get to her in a second) for shaving instead of waxing for so long, she was completely lovely and funny about it. She assured me it was going to hurt like a bitch, and not to feel guilty. Women are busy, she got it. You know who didn\\'t get it? My previous waxer th\\nat sounded like a bond villain and made me feel like crap for having hair to wax. Good riddance Olga, you smooth witch... 10spot4life. \\n\\nAnyhow. Meg is a genius. She talked and joked with me the entire time. She had Flight of the Concords playing, I was tweeting (not about what was happening) and she was explaining everything, cracking jokes and scientifically explaining everything. I was in and out in less than one episode of FOTC. Word. Best of all she constantly said \"good girl\", she is a one woman wax-super-hero-cheerleader. The. Best.\\n\\nThis spa is fun and has lots of great toxin-free products to help you break the bank at the end. I\\'ll be back for a mani soon. No pedi, though... I\\'ll kick you. \\n\\nPEPPER POINTS: For calling pulling out all of your box hair \"The Brazilly\". Cute(!)\\nPaying $7.50 for fresh pressed juice is not for everyone. \\n\\nIf you asked me six years ago if I would add this to my usual routine, I would have laughed you out of the room. However, things change and I am a\\n convert. Do I have time to go to the market regularly for fresh produce? Would I pay money to have someone else clean out my darn juicer? Basically, I\\'ve just deemed the health-giving goodness at Bolt worth the price tag. \\n\\nIn the warmer months, I\\'m all about their Green Pineapple juice and in the winter months they usually bring the heat with their vegan soups.\\nI\\'ve stared at my check in for Tortilla Flats for a really long time. I have waffled from one star to five stars for this brightly coloured, crazy-bad-it\\'s-good place. I\\'m going to play it safe and say they\\'re an A-OK establishment, but I reserve the right to update this review. \\n\\nThis place has a great back patio in the summer, covered with foliage so it\\'s not too hot and is still breezy. Perfect for sucking back their margarita specials, $3 tequila shots and $12 pitchers. \\n\\nTheir food is so. not. good. But I don\\'t think that necessarily makes it terrible. Sometimes I want to get drunk with a buddy and then decide to order a \\nsizzling plate of rubber chicken, or cream cheese filled poppers. This is my prerogative. \\n\\nPEPPER\\'S PREROGATIVE: Viva Tortilla Flats!\\nThe Hudson Bay Company. North America\\'s oldest commercial corporation. They started in pelt trading almost 350 years ago and they\\'re still going strong. \\n\\nI got my ears pierced at ten at The Bay in Halifax, NS after months of begging and pleading. My dad went on to brush out the tiny gold hoop when helping me untangle my hair, which was entirely devastating both physically and emotionally, but this is a tale for another time. \\n\\nMy point is, is that The Bay is a big part of Canada\\'s history, and I bet it\\'s part of your personal history, too.\\n\\nFlash to 2014, and I would like to say two words ten times over:\\nTop Shop\\nTop Shop\\nTop Shop\\nTop Shop \\nTop Shop\\nTop Shop\\nTop Shop\\nTop Shop\\nTop Shop\\nTop Shop\\n\\nI am currently away on a quick work jaunt, and I just looked down at my suitcase full of my dressier clothes, and they\\'re all from Top Shop, and they\\'re all rea', 'actual_label': 8, 'predicted_label': 8}, {'text': 'lly pretty. \\n\\nOne day my future children will mock my clothes in the year 2014 when they see a picture of me in all my glory, and they\\'ll ask what I was thinking and where I bought *that* outfit, and the answer will be fun to say: Same place you bought what you\\'re wearing... The Bay.\\nWhat the heck was I talking about in my last review of this place? Apparently I was a 70 year old woman in 2011 who couldn\\'t handle noise? Weird. Moving on... \\n\\nThis place is as solid as the bank vault you can reserve at the back of the restaurant. It\\'s as strong as the nose that sits atop it. It\\'s lovely, and is no longer the coolest kid in the neighbourhood, so on a Thursday at 8pm I didn\\'t have to wait for a table. \\n\\nI had their salad of the day (fennel can do no wrong), their linguini carbonara (creamy and yoke-y) and their piece de resistence: the osso bucco. Fall of the bone jus-soaked perfection. The gentleman across from me had pulled pork wrapped in ribeye with gorgonzola sauce and gravy. I\\'m not \\na pulled pork person, but it looked pretty epic. \\n\\nPEPPER\\'S PISSED about their wine mark up. It\\'s a bit much, Nose.\\nIn life one has to face a huge assortment of disappointments. Luckily for me, my perfect apartment is still perfect thanks to my neighbourhood laundromat. \\n\\nWhen I first realized my new apartment had no laundry I was absolutely gutted. How can you have bay windows, hardwood floors, such a big kitschy kitchen, an adorable porch and no laundry*? The pros outweighed the cons so I reluctantly moved in. What can I say? I love fresh clothes. Well luckily, George\\'s is mere steps away and I\\'ve truly come to embrace my laundromat time.\\n\\nThey don\\'t have Wifi, but I tether to my phone (like a boss), bring a tea, my purple wheelie suitcase and post up at one of their folding stations. They have 6-8 triple load washers and about the same amount of top-loaders. Their dryers are massive and quick, and 54 minutes (I think that\\'s 6 quarters) dries about 10 days worth of dryer friendly clo\\nthes. \\n\\nIf you aren\\'t into tethering to your phone and making a folding table your desk just enjoy a good book and the people watching. Sidebar: folks tend to wear the funniest stuff on laundry day. \\n\\nPEPPER POINTS for their detergent and change machines. Who has that many quarters normally? No one.  \\n\\n*Braggity-brag.\\nBut then sometimes they add a small fair, complete with Tilt-A-Whirl and massive slide, to the parking lot, and people like me get excited and give them an extra star on Yelp...\\nI love old school diners, burger joins and malt shops. This place has the vibe of all three put together... I dig, I dig. I came in here with a friend who has frequented Magoo\\'s much of his life, and the lady behind the counter joyfully saluted him by name when we came in. Come on, this place is cayuuuute. \\n\\nI had their gourmet burger and an iced tea. The burger was juicy, made on a grill in front of me, and then I got to choose my toppings from a wide variety under the glass. Think Subway only co\\nol. When next in this area, I will definitely return. Merci, Magoo!\\nOnce upon at time I worked very close to this take-away Freshii location. After separating myself from lunching here a little too often, I can now think of it fondly. \\n\\nI  am a big fan of building extravagant chicken and rice bowls. If you do it carefully, you can actually escape with a very healthy and cheap lunch. I was never wild for their smoothies, but perhaps I will give them a go again soon.\\nI love a good cheap slice of chewy, hot pizza from a take out joint. \\n\\nThe vegetarian and pepperoni slices from CiCi\\'s always hit the spot. I\\'ve only had it with my wee one on long walks in the hood, but I think I\\'m going to try one of their hot, fresh pies soon! \\n\\nSweet staff, sweet slices, takes all payments. CiCi is as cool as it comes, and is a Parkdale staple.\\nThis place is A-OK.\\n\\nI went on their grand opening day, which also happened to be my birthday! If you don\\'t already know, if you hit What A Bagel on your b-day th\\ney give you a dozen bagels for FREE! It might seem like too many bagels, but those suckers freeze well. I especially like their \"everything\" variety. \\n\\nAnyhow, aside from my bagel swag, I had an egg salad sandwich on a bagel. For what it is it was way too expensive (almost $10 for a bagel sandwich and a drink). I feel like a bit of a B for complaining about the price after they gave me free food, but when it isn\\'t your special day, that\\'s a lot to spend on a bagel sandwich. \\n\\nThe staff seemed quite disorganized, but as they had just opened I\\'m going to let that slide. I\\'ll update my review when I\\'m next there. Bagel. \\n\\nBAGEL GAME: Be the first to tell me how many times I said \"Bagel\" in this review, and I\\'ll buy you a bagel!\\nI had a Love Boat A with two lovelies last night, and it was fresh and tasty. A huge assortment of sushi, sashimi and maki on an adorable little boat. What more could a girl want? \\n\\nOn top of our Love Boat we ordered their spicy banana roll, something Mazz is appar', 'actual_label': 8, 'predicted_label': 8}, {'text': 'ently known for. What is wrong with y\\'all? It\\'s gross! If you like hot banana deep fried in sushi with spicy mayo maybe this is for you? But it sure as sugar ain\\'t for me. \\n\\nI\\'d like to return and sit in their special Island room at the back with the curtains drawn and have an ultimate sushi feast with friends.\\nI love you, Bobbie Sue. \\n\\nTonight my favourite guy and I took an evening stroll to our friendly neighbourhood mac and cheese stand, and it was everything we\\'d hoped it would be. No matter how cold an evening, when you\\'re buying your supper from a wooden kitchen stand, you\\'re instantly cozy. \\n\\nWe got their traditional mac and cheese and their bend on Hamburger Helper. Both were delicious, especially the hamburger one. Hamburger, mushrooms and gruyere mixed together make for one hell of a comfort food cocktail.\\nHey Meatball! Evelyn W here. \\n\\nI hopped off a flight after a whirlwind 36-hour-fun-fest and jumped in a cab at the downtown airport. I needed the internet, I needed to eat \\nand I needed a hug. Is there is a food that can nourish you and make you feel like you\\'re being hugged even if your not? A meatball sub. So \"College and Crawford, please...\" is what I muttered to the cab driver while checking my email. Before I knew it I was waiting for The Rod Father, my fave meatball sub of all time. And Bam! They have free wifi!\\n\\nJust go and get The Rod Father, and really enjoy the side salad. Top 5 side salads in the city. \\n\\nPEPPER POINTS for their made in house sodas. This hyper hypo killed a cream soda for the first time in years.\\nHoly crow! I\\'m wishing there was a sixth star button right about now. Hell, even a seventh. \\n\\nThree guys moved all of my stuff in just over an hour. They cracked jokes, were careful with all my valuables and put everything in the appropriate room upon arriving at their final destination. \\n\\nI\\'ve used them twice, and both times they\\'ve exceeded expectations. This time, they even price adjusted down, because they had originally quoted me a\\nt two hours. They\\'re not only hard working and fast, but honest. In the end I didn\\'t save any money because I tipped them the difference, but these boys earned it! \\n\\nMoving? Use them. Know someone that\\'s moving? Recommend them. \\n\\n*Written happily from the one clean corner of my new home.*\\nGet that jelly in my belly! \\n\\nI\\'ve had Jelly Modern Doughnuts on a few occasions, and people sure go nuts for these doughnuts. I\\'m a huge fan of their lemon curd, and I personally just ordered three dozen of their tasty treats for an upcoming party. This big order of Madascar Vanilla, Classic Jelly and Coconut came in under $100 and the best bit? For $20 you can get them delivered downtown! Hooray for donut delivery! \\n\\nNow I\\'d like to take a moment and hop up on my little soapbox and rant about designer donuts. For the past 2-3 years, fancy donuts have dominated cute cupcakes and cakepops here in the Big Smoke. This, I can get behind. What I can\\'t get behind is how ridiculous some of the flavours get.\\n.. bacon butter pecan chocolate raspberry dream. What the hell is that? Sometimes things taste best when they\\'re simpler, and Jelly Modern gets it right.\\nI\\'m going to keep this short and sweet just like my pop-by at Bar Neon last week. It was freezing, and a pal and I chose the exact halfway mark to meet, because we\\'re cool and know how to use internet maps. \\n\\nBar Neon has buck a shuck happy hours and really friendly staff. It\\'s warm dark and inviting, and I\\'ll definitely be back. \\n\\nTheir house red wine was terrible. Like awful, but I have a feeling it was corked/they ran to the LCBO to get a box for the night. I\\'m not holding this against them, though, because their beer list is excellent, and I have it on good authority that they can mix  mean cocktail. Bottoms up.\\nI\\'ve thought on this experience for a few days, and here\\'s the verdict. This place is A OK. Great actually, but they made a big blunder on me, so I am going to meet in the middle and give them three stars. Before I get int\\no the mistake, I just want to say that I will try Kim Nails again. The staff were super friendly, the place very clean and the prices fair. \\n\\nI came in for an impromptu pedicure, and they had room for me. Hooray. \\n\\nIt started great. My nails looked sharp, my feet exfoliated and my lower legs massaged. I sat for 10 minutes air drying next to a friend, then 10 minutes under a dryer. They came over and did that quik dry spray stuff, touched my nails and said I was good to go. \\n\\nThey then saran wrapped my feet. \\n\\nYes, you read that correctly.\\n\\nThey told me it was just in case, because it was winter and I was going to put on socks and boots. I then put my plastic-wrapped feet in goods, paid and tipped and went on my merry way. I walked straight home and took of the wrap, because, well, it was weird. In pulling it off, I lost the polish on both of my big toes. Ouff. \\n\\nTake my advice, if you aren\\'t in a rush and they try to literally wrap up your feet, just ask to sit a little longer. Are my ', 'actual_label': 8, 'predicted_label': 8}, {'text': \"feet soft? Yes. But I paid for the polish, too. Quite a bummer.\\nI've oft enjoyed my time at The Beacs. \\n\\nTheir patio is large and fun on summer nights, it's well located and their drinks are reasonably priced. \\n\\nI popped in recently on a Tuesday to see they had half priced bottles of prosecco. Not a bad Tuesday evening activity. Alas, my happy hour mate was drinking for two, and getting a bottle to myself seemed a touch sad (to do in public at least), so I went with a gin martini. Clink clink! \\n\\nThey do weekend DJs (yeaaaah Tanya), so beware the weekends are a lot more turnt up than a Tuesday. Two different yet equally enjoyable evenings... Whatever my mood, I usually have a terrific and tipsy time here.\\nI love their Ossington shoppe, so I was super excited when Superpoint opened their bar slash take out location here in perfect Parkdale. \\n\\nMost memorably, I came in here with some buddies for some celebratory wine, pizza and fernet. Their $5 slices are great, but snuggling up and tucki\\nng into a full pie is where it's at when it comes to Superpoint's saucy servings. \\n\\nBest review ever.\\nOh Oh Ossington! I am a major fan of The Ossington. It's a bit of a dive, but it really comes alive with a certain je ne c'est quoi with the right folks.\\n\\nI'm especially a fan of their Sunday evenings. Where their own version of Pub Stumper Trivia (Go Beiber's Weiner!) turns into a bunch of drunk people and then turns into old school hip hop night. If it's ever a long weekend or you can be hungover on a Monday, then get thee to here!\\n\\nTheir tequila shots are regularly priced, and in the summer they have Mill St Lemon Tea Beer on tap. I've never had any food here, but the bartenders know what they're doing. \\n\\nPEPPER POINTS For location, location, location. Waiting for a table at Libretto or hitting a show at the Garrison later? Than The O is your gal.\\nBam! It's so strange that I've never written a review for Sushi On Bloor, or SOB as I like to call it. But guess what? I'm giving this SO\\nB their 100th review! Happy Yelp Centennial, Sushi On Bloor! I love ya!\\n\\nSushi On Bloor is the best of the cheap Sushi lunches in Toronto. If you prefer New Generation, I only have one thing to say to you: Closed For Murder. Case closed.\\n\\nAnyway, the cold lunch specials are where it's at. If you make it in/call in your order before 4pm they will still give you their famed $5.99 special. \\n\\nS1 and S3 are my faves. I usually go for S1 which is 6 pieces of California Roll and 6 pieces of salmon. For an extra buck you can make it spicy salmon. Yum. This special also comes with miso soup, bottomless tea and their green salad which has the best ginger dressing in town. None of that ginger-mayo crap. \\n\\nThis place is cheap, cheerful and they're great with the fast turnover.\\n\\nPEPPER POINTS: For never being Closed For Murder.\\nSo my last update was a little off. They have stopped with the oysters, and the patio isn't in full swing, but...\\n\\nThey have done some pop-up menus with varying chefs, but i\\nt looks like they've got some keepers for supper hour and they aren't messing around. Get some of their delish delights (think: tortiere, pea soup with biscuits and braised beef poutine) to go with your craft cocktails and reasonably priced wine and beer. Mmm K?\\nI think the servers were wearing gun holsters... or something like that. There was also a giant Yellow door with bright lights over it and a mounted buffalo head over the bar. This place is a palatial cocktail lovin' meat-eater's fantasy, but it appears to be having a bit of an identity crisis. \\n\\nThe drinks are very, very expensive. Like pushing $20 for a martini which is absolutely absurd. I ordered one gin martini and it wasn't anything special and cost more than my meal.\\n\\nWe started with the oysters (no going wrong there, ever) and then I had the mushroom pasta. It was divine. Seriously perfect meal for me. Butter and safe and cheese? Le oui. But the food alone can't save this place. It's just too pretentious and annoying. K\\ning W just ain't my scene. \\n\\nPEPPER POINTS for the bathroom being upstairs and not in a basement. Stupid Toronto bathrooms.\\nDo you know how hard it is to find a delicious dinner on a Monday night in Queen W W? Thank you sincerely, Porzia, for remembering some of us don't buy groceries any night of the week. \\n\\nAs you can guess from my mini rant, we came in on a Monday night with some friends and enjoyed their mix-and-match, three-for-thirty prix fixe Monday menu. I had the crostini, the asparagus salad and the tortellini. In the end, the tortellini was too fishy for me, but the other two were huge culinary wins. Win win! \\n\\nThe atmosphere is adorable with wooden benches, lovely little touches and some of the kindest servers I've come across in Parkdale. I shall return!\\nIs there anything worse than bathing suit shopping in the winter under fluorescent lights? No. No matter how much you love your lady bits (and bless you if you do!), this shiz is rough. Luckily, the Urban Eatery is stocked\", 'actual_label': 8, 'predicted_label': 8}, {'text': ' with A&W and a cornucopia of other junk foods and is housed in the same building. \\n\\nJunk food fixes bikini woes... right? RIGHT?!\\n\\nI appreciate that this store exists, and everyone needs bathing suits, but do we all really need patterned triangle bikinis and Hawaiian wraps? Is this the 90\\'s? I\\'d love to see the buyers stock some cooler vintage looks, or just some more muted colours. Softer lighting? That\\'d be nice, too.\\n\\nThe staff is very kind, though. They do get that bathing suit shopping is trying. Respect to them. \\n\\nPEPPER IS PISSED: At society. \\n\\n8/30\\nFull disclosure: I recently did a couple of events with North Poke and after getting to sample their deliciousness two nights not too long ago, I was craving it again hard. I\\'ve since been back two more times as a paying customer. \\n\\nI am all about their Hawaii Classic, tuna sharply marinated in perfection, hold the onions. Their middle size is all you need for a very filling meal, but if you\\'re starving there\\'s a massive size, too. \\nThis summer they\\'re going to start serving shaved ice, and I look forward to popping for a cool down once the weather warms up. Aloha!\\nMy husband swears by this place for his dry cleaning, and I needed straps brought up on a dress, so I thought I\\'d give them a go as tailors. They did a perfect job. They\\'re kind, accommodating to your schedule and they genuinely love your clothes as much as you do. If it wasn\\'t super weird to throw a party at a dry cleaning joint, I\\'d probably ask them to host my birthday. They\\'re that cool.\\nI scream, you scream, we all scream for sushi. SUSHI! \\n\\nOK, my creative juices are drained today, and that\\'s not my best intro, but I\\'m full on delicious Oasaka Sushi, and I want to tell you about it. I had California rolls, small green salad, salmon sashimi and spicy tuna rolls and it was delicious. \\n\\nThe way they do the spicy rolls is the chopped-up-and-shmooshed inside the roll thing, which isn\\'t my favourite, but really it\\'s a small price to pay for tasty treats\\n from the sea. \\n\\nLittle Lady Lazy likes: They deliver with Just-Eat. Even at lunch time.\\nAll east coast transplants should be getting on the TTC and not stopping until Greenwood and Danforth... and if you\\'ve never had an east coast donair, stop being silly and get thee to The Fuzz Box. \\n\\nI am first and foremost a Haligonian and I thoroughly enjoyed my donair and garlic fingers. The prices are the same as in Halifax, and the flavors spot on.\\n\\nThe meat is a bit crumblier and leaner, and they used orange cheddar on the garlic fingers but these were very minor variations. \\n\\nWelcome to Toronto, Fuzz Box, I\\'m mega glad you\\'re here. \\n\\nPS: Next time I will try their donair pogo. Mmhmm.\\n416 751 5555 was the very first number I memorized upon moving to Toronto in 2003. It\\'s been a decade, and I\\'m still calling my pals at Beck on the regular. \\n\\nThey\\'re never thrilled to take debit, they usually never say a word, but they\\'re prompt and have the most cabs in Toronto. Pepper props all around, but we\\n\\'ve all had that one horrible cab story, so they\\'re not getting five stars.\\n\\n\"Can I have a cab to blah blah for Evelyn that takes debit?\" \\n\"Five to ten minutes.\" \\nThe End.\\nOnce upon a time in Manhattan there was a young girl who would pretend to be a tourist who couldn\\'t find her ticket and jump \"back\" on the hop-on-hop-off double-decker bus. She\\'d ride from The Apollo in Harlem alllll the way to South Street Seaport to buy casual chic navy blue and beige clothes from a massive Abercrombie and Fitch. This activity brought her much joy*.\\n\\nOK. It was me, and once upon a time was once upon... I was too old to be doing this, but it was a long time ago. Moving on.\\n\\nThe Abrcrombie that they\\'ve brought to Canada and stuck in the bottom of a mall in Dundas Sq, well, sucks. It\\'s dark and moody and reeks of their in-house perfume. This scent is likely the alternate for many young girls\\' Boyfriend by Justin Bieber. This A & F also blasts electro-pop at a poisonous volume. Headache central. \\n\\nI br\\naved this blast from the past because I clearly remember never having to hem their jeans (I\\'m wee) and that they knew how to make decent over-bathing suit attire (I also like to hide my jelly bits), white linen hippie shirts, etc. This is probably still the case, but the store was so horrible I didn\\'t stay long enough to find out. \\n\\nPEPPER PREDICTS she will be all up on their website soon looking for some of the above mentioned items. \\n\\n*I have just given a bunch of young women in Harlem a clever way to boot it downtown in NYC. You\\'re welcome.\\nWay up yonder in ye cold north, there aren\\'t too many independent bean pushers. Everywhere one looks it\\'s green signs and six dollar frappuccinos. \\n\\nEnter Mad Bean. A small and cheerful coffee shop with free wifi and bagels. The price point is low, the people quality is high, and the ambiance is what you\\'d expect if you were at a similar location south of Bloor. \\n\\nI had a green tea, but the man running the joint takes a lot of pride in their amer', 'actual_label': 8, 'predicted_label': 8}, {'text': \"icanos, so if coffee is your thing be sure to try one. \\n\\nPEPPER TAKES PAUSE: They have really fun posters in the bathroom. You will stay in there too long.\\nYou can book a cheese cellar here for private events.\\n\\nThe above statement is enough to garner this place five sexy stars without hesitation. \\n\\nEnoteca Sociale is some of the best Italian food I've had in Toronto. I went in with a colleague and we started with some whiskey cocktails, red wine and their fabulous house made bread. I had the rigatoni with red-wine braised beef. The meat was soft and exquisite. The portion initially seemed small, and I knew I was going to want more but I was perfectly full at the end. We over serve pasta on this side of the pond, and this place keeps it real. \\n\\nIt's definitely a date night kind of place, and I'll bring my sweetie back here. Not that I didn't have a lovely candlelit meal with Yelp's Biz Outreach manager... I just recommend this joint for couples over colleagues. \\n\\nYou can book a cheese c\\nellar here for private events.\\nThe Rivoli is a Queen W icon from a time way back when Spadina and Queen was the place to be on a Friday night. She's a real dame. A triple threat.\\n\\nUpstairs they have pool tables, a bar and booths. Downstairs they have a lounge-style restaurant and the infamous people-watching patio. At the back of the main floor they have a live music venue and another bar. I've seen some good shows here, so keep an eye \\n\\nFor dinner here I've had the Beef Stroganoff (excellent) and the mussels (decent). Their drinks are surprisingly reasonably priced. \\n\\nNOTE: If you are going to an event here you will be ID'd at the door. Even if you're *33.\\n\\nPEPPER POINTS: For having bathrooms upstairs and on the main level. No rape dungeon bathrooms in this ol' girl. \\n\\n*Happened to a friend on their 33rd birthday. I am not yet 30, and I will be 28 for a while. Like 6 years-ish. Deal with it.\\nAfter a nice late night meal here, I'm going to eat some crow and update my review. \\n\\nThe frie\\ns, Hunter's stew and pierogies were all excellent and really hit the spot. The stew was an especially nice surprise, very hearty and plentiful with a rich broth and toast. \\n\\nI Previously was too hard on the food here, or they've really turned it around. Either way, check it out!  \\n\\nI still can't effing spell their name...\\nFear not, Yelpers. Bro culture is alive and well in Liberty Village. \\n\\nThis neighbhourhood, man. It's clean and a faux, like a movie set. Beautiful old brick buildings turned into everything one could need sitting below towers filled with bros, yuppies and young families that crush on the condo scene. There aren't quite enough businesses (yet) to handle the amount of people living here, so everywhere is always smoking busy. Brazen Head is no different.\\n\\nIt was the first day of American football, so my friend and I who had earned lunch after some aggressive furniture shopping were surrounded by jack asses while we dined. Be smarter than us, and google if it's a heavy s\\nports day before heading into a pub in Liberty Village with TVs. Oy. \\n\\nThe above being said, this place has a lot of redeeming qualities. A caesar bar where you can decorate your own drink during brunch, huge portions, fresh fries and a nice staff. Try the club of the fried chicken sandwich with side salads if you are hungry and enjoy big pieces of chicken and lettuce with whimsy.\\nWhat an awkward little mall. \\n\\nKaraoke, Dim Sum restaurants, odds and ends shops I don't get, and of course a Dairy Queen make up this bizarre bazaar of Chinese tricks. \\n\\nI'm not one of those people that hates Chinatown. In fact, I love buying party odds and ends, vegetables and blindly ordering snails off of menus while indulging in cold tea. But this mall is like a sterile insane asylum lined with stores that just don't. make. sense. \\n\\nPEPPER'S PISSED at the mailman. When a package is missed it's sent to the basement of this place.\\nI grew up in Halifax, Nova Scotia, so my taste for authentic Mexican isn't a\\nlways on point. In fact, sometimes I crave ground beef smothered in sour cream and veggies, and this place will do that for me sans judgement. \\n\\nTheir burrito sizes are true to their names, which some people see as a con, but not I. If I ask for a small, I mean a small, I do not mean something the size of my thigh that will inevitably half end up in a waste bin. The toppings run the gamut from expected: guac, salsas, rice, and refried beans to the unexpected: noodles, butter chicken, crunchies and more.\\n\\nTwo can easily dine for about $15 and when you're hungry, it's late and you're on W Queen W, this place can have you eating in 10 minutes or less. Long live the bastard!\\nMy husband's a huge coffee snob (the woooooooooooorst), so this is where he buys his beans. Minus a bajillion temperature, pushing a newborn in a snowsuit, in a snowstorm, uphill both ways... all for his coffee.\\n\\nThe people that work here are super sweet, though, and I enjoy their espresso drinks very much, so I can't \", 'actual_label': 8, 'predicted_label': 8}, {'text': \"hate too much on bean pilgrimages. I especially dig their lattes in the winter, iced americanos in the summer.\\nMy husband is here, oh, let's round down and say 10 times per week. He loves it. \\n\\nI popped in recently for a quick macchiato and gluten-filled ginger cookie and was impressed with the space. It's pristine white, lovely green touches, the uge reclaimed wood tables and fast wifi. I'm a fan of matcha which is prominent on their menu, so I will be back. Not as often as my husband, but I'll be back...\\nIs buying two bagel sandwiches for over $25 who I am now? I really can't afford this habit, but I don't know that I care, they're so. Damn. Delicious. \\n\\nMy go to is gravlax with schmear and capers on an everything bagel. My partner in crime usually gets one of their house-suggested sandwiches. \\n\\nIf you like a good, nay great, bagel and lox, Schmaltz is for you. Be aware, though, if you're hitting it during the uge weekend hangover hours, be prepared for a bit of a line.\\nLa Diperie's \\nteeny-tiny mix and match dip cones have made my little family's W Queen W life so much sweeter. If you want to live life king size, that's available, too. They have pretty much every type of dip, topping and magic you could ask for on your soft serve. \\n\\nThis mint green lover is instagrammable and it actually tastes good. No offense to the charcoal kids on the block, but is that actually a treat, or just a photo op? To be determined.\\nIn the great Parkdale debate of Rhino Vs Cadillac Lounge, I am finally ready to cast my vote. I never considered myself a car girl, but I'm going with the Cadillac Lounge! \\n\\nHow can somewhere with this patio and this crazy friendly service have less than a four star average? My mind is boggled. I know it's just standard pub snacks and regular bar drinks, but come on. This patio! Half covered, half in shrubbery, all hidden behind West Queen West. It easily seats over 100 people, and the folks who pop in are varied, but it's always a decent grouping, just as \\nyou'd expect in Parkdale. \\n\\nThis summer, if you're sick of chasing fads and paying a buttload for cocktails, know that you can always park it at The Cadillac and still have a very decent time.\\nFrom the comfort of our couch, my buddy and I were after a New York style slice. Toronto has dominated beautiful personal pizzas with fresh ingredients reminiscent of Venice, but for some reason hasn't mastered the art of the cheap slice. I'm not sure if Fresca is what we were after totally, but it was thin, bendable and greasy. They delivered hot, cheap pizza within 30 minutes of ordering. I'll try it again, but I'm not a convert.\\nHollywood Cone definitely has an important place in today's world. Over the top, instagrammable mutant shakes have been all the rage for a while, and they definitely do it well. Do you need a donut on your ice cream? Do you enjoy a banana split that weighs more than your dog? Hollywood Cone is for you.\\n\\nI popped in with an adult and a toddler for some of their simpler \\ntreats and they were delicious. Dipped cones and a rootbeer float. Pricy, yes, but very yummy. Stay weird, Toronto.\\nWhen it comes to party supplies, I am an expert. \\n\\nThis Party City location has never let me down. It always seems quite picked over, Dollarama style, but it's still A OK by me. Yes, it's a bit out of the way, but sometimes you just need those giant aisles of masks, mardi gras beads and plastic easter eggs only available to one in the 'burbs.\\nI can't give them only one star, because I bought my darling Clementine there in 2006. She is a marvelous bright orange one-speed. (Hi Clementine!)\\n\\nWhen I bought her she was only $200, my lock cost more. Now the same bike sells for over $600 there. They saw the hipster value of the old school bikes, and then hiked the prices up waaaay too much. Uncool.\\n\\nBut here's my big beef: \\nLast year I ordered a new seat and helmet from them, I gave them both of my phone numbers. They never phoned. The items just NEVER came in. So I re-ordered t\\nhem, and again, they never came in. \\n\\nThe worst.\\n\\nMo game: Around this store you can't tell if a teeny stache is hipster or Movember. It's a fun game to play. Hips-or-Mo?\\nWhen people discuss going to Leslieville for brunch, (which happens more often than you'd think!) this joint is always mentioned. \\n\\nSo last Sunday we biked 10 minutes due east until we arrived at this crowded little restaurant. \\n\\nI had the Provencal omelettte with salad. I'd never had olives in an omelette before, and as a salt hussy I was very pleased. The greens it came with were just boxed greens, and they were drenched in a vinegar heavy dressing. My friend had their sandwich special, which was a spicy bacon (meat cured in house) sandwich. It was really nice.\\n\\nI had ordered their soup of the day to start (watermelon gazpacho!) which sounded so lovely... unfortunately they never brought it and then charged me for it. I caught it on the bill, so I didn't pay for it. But this incident likely brought them down from a \", 'actual_label': 8, 'predicted_label': 8}, {'text': \"4 to a 3.25 star rating. \\n\\nI'll likely come back here, but not until I continue making my Leslieville brunch rounds.\\n\\nBONUS: Open on Canada Day, so likely open on other holidays throughout the summer, unlike the rest of Leslieville.\\n\\nBIZARRE: No AC inside but built-in patio heaters.\\nI crush on all candlelit yet casual Italian joints. I just do. Tavernitis (which reads like an infection in English, let's be honest) fits the mold. \\n\\nThis place is so quaint it hurts, and is located on the main strip in Little Italy on College. It's a good place for a reasonably priced date, and their pizzas are the star of the show. The four cheese was simple and perfect. Thin crust, but not so thin that it got soggy when I was eating my buds' leftovers. \\n\\nI however, went with the veal parm and was greatly disappointed. The pasta on the side was 'plain tomato', but tasted like it could have come from a jar. Bummer. I started with the lentil soup, which I really enjoyed, though. So, you win some, you lose \\nsome. \\n\\nI choose not to comment on the service. A cornucopia of minor disasters and mix ups, but they were very busy and both servers seemed sweet. But like, they never brought my friend a fork... fork that. Oops, I guess I commented. \\n\\nPEPPER POINTS: For the red and white checked table cloths. So cute. \\n\\n15/30\\nTalk nerdy to me, Warby Parker. \\n\\nBefore their retail store opened here in TO last year, I ordered spectacles from Warby Parker online. I'm a fan girl of any company that does good, has pretty products and keeps prices in check. Every pair I've gotten has been exactly $150, and as long as their business model doesn't change, every pair of glasses I buy forever will be $150. \\n\\nThe store itself is super cute and filled with nice, knowledgable staff. They have cookies for pups and maps of great places to read in TO. Cute, cute, cute!\\nVeggie Delight (veg gravy, peas, mushrooms and onions) + extra cheese. It always hits the spot for me, and I'm a meat eater. \\n\\nAlso, this location of \\nSmoke's is always playing really fun retro radio songs late at night and I have participated in a pout dance party more than once.\\n\\nGhost ride the pout!\\nI didn't grow up in Toronto, so I never knew Ontario Place in her heyday. I will say,  though, in the summertime there is still a lot going on! The venue is used for lots of festivals and fairs and the park and water views are fabulous. \\n\\nThe IMAX is back up and running in the Cinesphere and and I look forward to introducing my daughter to the joy of pedal boats soon.\\nHolts, you dark mistress of debt creation. If I were a wealthy kept woman I would surely be a lady who lunched and shopped here. \\n\\nYou give Barney's a run for its money and have divas all over Canada thinking pink. \\n\\nPEPPER POINTS for your easy to access/exit layout.\\nThis review is gonna be short... because I'm too busy looking at my perfectly shellacked purple nails to risk ruining them by typing. Oh wait, they are guaranteed for a week? My bad. I'll type all day.\\n\\nThis \\nis one of the cleanest, most adorable nail salons in the city. I'm not going to pretend to be an expert, but even my unpolished hands can tell you this place is the real deal. The best. The shit.\\n\\nThey have a large collection of girly movies playing on a flat screen above where you face when you get your mani (shellac, crackle, normal, french...), this magical TV is also visible from their massage-chair pedi stations. Nice, right?!\\n\\nThe owner and the girls that work there are all so sweet, gentle and helpful. They are running a clean, lovely, fun operation. Shellac mani for $30? Hells Yes.\\n\\nPEPPER POINTS: For having the newest trash rag magazines. No old news here, all the straight-up goods on what Jennifer Aniston did last week.\\nIf you're in the Yorkville area, and aren't a baller, this little street has two great pub options. The Duke, which is usually my go to, and the Bedford Academy, which is actually a little bit better in my humble opinion. \\n\\nThe Academy has a nice shaded street\\nside patio, reasonably priced wine and beer list and great pub grub. I recently enjoyed a bottle of Sauv Blanc and the chorizo mac and cheese while soaking up some rays.\\nUtopia, or Utops, as I lovingly call her is always there for me. \\n\\nShe has a bit of an identity crisis going on, but who doesn't. This place has tex-mex, veggie, comfort food, burgers, and more. It's a huge menu. I've never had anything bad here, and I especially enjoy their veggie gravy poutine and various types of quesadillas. \\n\\nLast night I went here with friends and had the fried chicken and avocado burrito. It was delicious, but I always forget I don't really like their coleslaw (sesame oil-y) or their rice (not spicy like other tex-mex rice, often undercooked.) They let you sub in other things at minimal costs, so this is totally my bad for being disappointed in my sides (again). \\n\\nThe service here is always good, though last night was a bit strange. Our server was quite twitchy... and worked at a wizard-like spe\", 'actual_label': 8, 'predicted_label': 8}, {'text': 'les, strawberries and  figs over fresh greens tossed in a homemade \\nbalsamic syrup.) Delicious!  I went with the large version and ate it all!\\n\\nI also shared an order of thyme fries although my lunch companion and I agreed that we couldn\\'t taste the thyme...\\n\\nI noticed there were a bunch of fun and unique vegan products for sale including some sweet treats that looked damn good.  Service was friendly and efficient (thanks Stevie).  I\\'ll be back soon!\\nI\\'ve had the luxury of visiting Joya Spa on several occasions.  Every visit, I am blown away by how incredible it is to spend time there.  I went once before my wedding for a solo spa day and had a massage and a facial; another time, I went with a friend and kept her company while she had a pedicure; I took a yoga class and used the fitness room during my wedding weekend, and most recently, I used a gift card that I was given for the holidays and my mom joined me for the experience... she had a facial and I had a massage.\\n\\nWhile all of the\\n services I\\'ve received have been top notch, it\\'s also the ambiance, decor, customer service, amenities, spiritual details, etc... that make this an incredible destination.  The scents used in the spa, massage oil, lotions, and potions are created specifically by the Montelucia\\'s alchemist... every details is covered at the Joya Spa.  \\n\\nI also love the special chocolate that is given to you after your services, the beds in the whisper room, the snacks in the waiting room, and the fortune / quote that is given to you as well.  Most recently, my quote read \"The little things? The little moments? They aren\\'t little.\" (Jon Kabat-Zinn) - So true. \\n\\nI highly recommend an escape to the Joya Spa to anyone and everyone; and when you call to make your appointment, be sure to ask about specials - there is always something special going on at Joya Spa!\\nI just returned home from another visit to The Covenant... this time it was for a Mother\\'s Day ladies brunch and it was great.\\n\\nI made a 10:45 rese\\nrvation via Yelp for four people (me, my mother-in-law, my grandmother-in-law, and my daughter).  I wasn\\'t sure how it would work out for my 5 year old, as I didn\\'t know if The Covenant offered a kids menu, but they did, and it worked out just fine.\\n\\nThis time my party was seated in Gabby\\'s section, and she was fabulous.  My daughter did the kids pasta and fruit and the adults shared a hummus board, avocado toast, and a frittata.  It was more than enough food.  \\n\\nThe special chocolate covered strawberries for the mothers at the end of the meal were a very nice (and delicious surprise).  Thanks so much and Happy Mother\\'s Day to those reading this today ;)\\nI started going to this dry cleaners out of convenience a couple of years ago... they are located in the shopping center on the Southeast corner of Thomas and Scottsdale Roads, and there happens to be a Blockbuster, Starbucks, Jamba Juice, Noodles Ranch, etc... in the same little area.  They\\'ve always done a decent job on my dry cleani\\nng in the past and continue to do so...  \\n\\nFunny story: The other day, I totally thought that Diamond Cleaners lost an item of my clothing and replaced it with a black dress that wasn\\'t mine.  Needless to say, I wasn\\'t too happy so I wrote a facebook status update about it and a two star yelp review... and then I spoke to Danny who works at Diamond Cleaners and realized that the dress was indeed part of what I dropped off.  Turns out, it was my sister-in-law\\'s dress.  I am an idiot!\\n\\nMy apologies for the wrong accusation, Diamond Cleaners...\\n\\nI\\'ll be back to see you soon!\\nI know, I know... I am supposedly on a strict wedding diet... but I did splurge the other night - I couldn\\'t help it, I was craving me some fro yo.  And since I hadn\\'t been to Yogurtland yet, I decided to try it!\\n\\nI was pleasantly surprised... mostly with the flavor selection, the toppings, and the price.  It\\'s worth mentioning that I\\'m usually not a fan of self-serve because I tend to over do it.  But the machines at\\n Yogurtland seem to be user-friendly - the fro yo comes out just quickly enough where one has total control!  I sampled a vanilla wafer flavor and a coconut flavor before choosing a pomegranate tart and plain tart twist in my cup.  I was bummed that the flavor they were advertising on the wall up front (lemon / lime tart) was out for the evening I was there.  \\n\\nThe topping I was most excited about was lychee!  I\\'ve never seen that before... I had a few of those (they were almost gone and the ones that were there seemed to have gotten some chocolate sprinkles or something on them), along with mochi and mango.  Great combo!\\n\\nWhile the kids working there were friendly, they weren\\'t up front when I initially walked in (I reached over and took my own sample cup), and they weren\\'t doing the best job cleaning the topping area either.  But, it appeared that Yogurtland\\'s prices were less than most of their competition.  I walked out of there with a decent sized fro yo for just $2.52.  Such a st', 'actual_label': 9, 'predicted_label': 9}, {'text': 'eal!\\n\\nI noticed on my way out that they had strawberry water available for patrons - not only is that pleasing to look at, but I bet it tastes great too... \\n\\nNot a huge fan of the parking situation due to the strip mall they are located in, but it\\'s not a huge deal.  I am sure I\\'ll be back to visit Yogurtland - hopefully next time they will have the lemon lime tart flavor and more lychee too!\\nJust a quick update since I was at the UYE Spa Tasting Event tonight... once again, The Lamar Spa took good care of me and the rest of those that attended tonight\\'s event.\\n\\nAs Jennifer noted in her review, Heidi Lamar was there herself to make sure everyone was satisfied.  The services were wonderful and just enough to get a feel for what a full service would be like.  I enjoyed a chair massage from Shirley, make-up application from Danton (who did a spectacular job and in just a few minutes, I felt \"pretty, oh so pretty\") and paraffin hand wax treatment from Jane - all of  this paired with some f\\nood and Sake2Me made for a fantastic evening!  \\n\\nThe best part about tonight?  Other than getting to hang with some fabulous yelpers and see Bonnie G\\'s man get his eyebrows waxed, my BF came and treated himself to a facial and then surprised me with a gift card so I can return to get pampered again soon... Now the tough question is what should I use my gift card for?  A facial?  Pedicure?  Massage?  I\\'m sure I can\\'t go wrong but PM me with your suggestions, please!  Can\\'t wait to go back for more!\\nTotties...\\nI\\'ve read the 24 reviews that came before mine over and over, and I have to say, it was even better than expected!\\n\\nPicture this:\\nSunday evening - dark and cold outside.  Hanging inside with fiance and future sister-in-law.  All of us feeling tired and hungry but too lazy to cook dinner.  Just watched Grey\\'s Anatomy and Private Practice reruns and worked up appetite...\\n\\nThai food?  I suggested to them - oh yeah, we can\\'t do that... none of the thai restaurants are open on Sundays. \\n Damn.\\n\\nVietnamese maybe?  Nope - the closest one I could think of was closed on Sundays also.\\n\\nChinese?  Too bad we don\\'t have a great Chinese restaurant close by in the new \\'hood anymore.\\n\\nI know, let\\'s try somewhere new... Totties!  I called to make sure they were open, and sure enough - not only were they open, but they are not even a mile away!  Perfect...\\n\\nTottie\\'s was awesome - it was nicer inside than I imagined - for some reason I had in my head that it was going to be like Pei Wei - but it wasn\\'t at all.  We were seated immediately and Kethy was our server (yes, Kethy - not Kathy).  She was cute and had personality - something you don\\'t always find in restaurants now-a-day.  She honored our request to start with a big bowl of egg drop soup and add wontons to it!\\n\\nWith the soup on the way, we perused the menu... I love that Tottie\\'s offers Chinese, Thai, Vietnamese, and sushi too!  We mixed it up a bit and ordered Pad Se Ew with Beef, Moo Shu Chicken, Thai Basil Stir Fry veggi\\nes, and steamed vegetable dumplings.  Medium spice and light on the oil.  It was way too much food, but it was fun to share a bunch of dishes, and now we have leftovers for dinner tonight!\\n\\n**Pad Se Ew was the favorite dish of all but nothing we ordered was disappointing.\\n\\nTotal bill for all of the above was $43 before tip... not bad considering the amount of food we had!  Service was attentive - not only from Kethy, but Tottie (I think) came by, and our waters were fill constantly too.\\n\\nI will totally return to Tottie\\'s in the near future whether it be for Chinese, Thai, Sushi, or Vietnamese - or a combo... oh, and I\\'ll have to remember to save room for the avocado ice cream next time!\\nAfter eying this location of RoadRunner Sports for some time now (since it was built), I decided I would go in today to check it out.  It was Saturday afternoon around 3:00 and the place had plenty of customers buzzing around.  The store is set up in a way that is easy to navigate - women\\'s apparel to t\\nhe left, women\\'s shoes on the wall straight ahead, men\\'s to the right, etc... it\\'s always nice when you can go straight to what you are looking for when you go somewhere for the first time.\\n\\nI looked around a bit as I waited.  I was greeted by a couple of busy salespeople before Elizabeth came over to see if I needed some help.  By that time, I knew exactly what I wanted... \\n\\nMe: \"I\\'d like to try on a pair of these Adidas Adistar Cushion\" if you have them in a size 6.\\nElizabeth:  \"Sure - let me go see if we have them in your size\"\\n(she comes out with the pair I asked for)\\nMe: \"This is the next model of the pair I\\'ve been wearing, correct?  (I show her my old pair)\"\\nElizabeth: \"Yes it is\"\\nMe: \"Do you recommend these?  Notice anything on the tread of my old ones that stands out?\"\\nElizabeth: \"Nope - they look fine to me; it\\'s totally normal to ware out the lateral side of the heels when you run\"\\nMe: \"OK - cool\"\\n\\nI tried them on, ran around the store a bit, and decided to purchase them.  E', 'actual_label': 9, 'predicted_label': 9}, {'text': 'asy enough!  The fact that they were on sale was a bonus... (I would hope that if someone came in not knowing what they wanted, they would get more help than I did.)\\n\\nI had to wait a bit at the register but as I was doing so, I noticed that this particular store has group runs on Tuesdays and Thursdays at 6:00pm and Saturdays at 6:15am - good to know!  I also picked up a few race fliers for upcoming events (check out our events calendar for the info).  I opted not to join the VIP club just yet, but it may make sense to do so if I continue to shop at RR.\\n\\nIf anyone reading this has experience with Roadrunner\\'s brand of apparel, I\\'d be interested to hear your feedback on it.  PM me with your thoughts.  Thanks in advance - I\\'m off to test out my new shoes!\\nYes... Here I am reviewing yet another yoga studio!\\n\\nThey say \"variety is the spice of life,\" and I feel the same way about mixing up my yoga practice with different studios, styles, instructors, music, etc... \\n\\nI\\'ve actually been going\\n to this Biltmore Studio location for years (as noted by my 24 Yelp check-ins at the time of this review), but just learned that this one is under new management.  I hope that nothing will change as a result since this studio offers friendly staff, great instructors, a heated room (most of the time), a good sound system / music, cold towels for savasana when class is over, clean locker room with showers, and the basics for purchase or rental up front.  \\n\\nI love this location because it\\'s convenient to my work and frequent visits to AJ\\'s and Trader Joe\\'s.  I also have an intention to one day go to a yoga class here, shower up in their locker room, head over to DryBar next door for a blow-out, and then head to the Fat Ox next door to that for some drinks and dinner...  How perfect would that be?!  I don\\'t anticipate having the time to do that in the near future, but perhaps my husband will read this and plan that for a special occasion sometime ;)\\n\\nUntil then, I\\'ll continue my spontaneou\\ns visits to this Biltmore Studio location (mixed into my rotation of other workouts and yoga around town) followed by a quick rinse and a coconut water before rushing back into my typical reality of work, kiddos, sports games, birthday parties, etc...  and for all of that I am grateful!  Namaste!\\nWildflower Bread Company has grown on me through the years... What I first considered to be just another chain, has proved it\\'s quality and provided plenty a pleasant dining experience both when dining solo and in groups.  Due to this convenient WBC location, I\\'ve been here quite a few times over the past few weeks, and I always leave satisfied!  \\n\\nLately I\\'ve been a fan of their chopped salad and chicken salad.  I\\'m currently eating for two and their portions are large enough to fill me up.  The bread is fresh and delicious.  I\\'m also a fan of their lemonade but I wish they offered refills.  \\n\\nWhile I enjoy the fast-casual concept of ordering at the counter and having your food delivered to y\\nou, this seems to be a hot spot during lunch and it\\'s sometimes challenging to find a table.  I\\'m sure it will be better once the weather cools down a bit so people can take advantage of the patio seating.\\n\\nI learned today that this location also has a dining area that can blocked off for more \"private dining\" for groups.  I may just have to look into that in the future.  Keep up the good work, WBC - I\\'m sure I\\'ll see you again soon.\\nTime flies when you\\'re having fun...\\nIt\\'s been almost a full year since my initial review of Bacon, and I\\'ve been back probably ten times or more.\\n\\nI\\'ve seen a lot of transition with the employees but I can say that their service has gotten much better since the beginning.  The casual atmosphere is right up my alley for a weekend breakfast, and my yogi omelette / protein pancake orders have stayed consistent too.  \\n\\nI was there earlier today and while the service was spot-on, I did find a piece of ham in my otherwise veggie omelette - but I overlooked it a\\nnd enjoyed my meal nonetheless...\\n\\nMy husband has been to Bacon even more than i have, and he told me he recently sampled what\\'s to come on their new lunch menu (think pastrami sandwich).  So, go for breakfast, go for lunch, go for a Bloody Mary or a Mimosa... just kick back and enjoy your meal!\\nOn the hunt for some shelving for the Baby M\\'s nursery, we made the trip out to Chandler yesterday to check out this Pottery Barn Kids.  \\n\\nAs the other reviews say, this place is super-cute albeit very pricey.  They have a decent selection although we\\'re going for bright white and their \"white\" is more creme / antique off white, so that is not going to work for us.  The service was not the friendliest either, but I\\'m going to take into consideration that we were there on a Saturday afternoon and they were jam packed. \\n\\nBefore I schlep out to Chandler to this PBK store in the future, I\\'ll likely do my research online on their website.  But if price isn\\'t an issue and you\\'re looking for super cut', 'actual_label': 9, 'predicted_label': 9}, {'text': 'e kids\\' furniture and decor items, you can\\'t go wrong at PBK!\\nI\\'ve enjoyed lunch, dinner, and take-out from Noodles Ranch, so I finally feel ready to write my review...\\n\\nThe service is always attentive and Alan (who has been my waiter every time) is more than willing to make recommendations for me.  I\\'ve had the following dishes and highly recommend any and all of them:\\n\\nA2 - Goi Cuon Thit Tom - Spring rolls - the kind that are not fried - I get them with shrimp / no pork and they are delicious and light!\\n\\nA5 - Banh Xeo - Crispy Happy Pancake - unique flavor - tastes like an egg crepe... great if you are seeking something different!\\n\\n\\nM4 - Yakisoba mi xao - a tasty yakisoba noodle dish with veggies and your choice of meat\\n\\nT2 - Bombay Veggies - Wok stir-fried tofu and veggies with curry coconut sauce\\n\\nB3 - Stir-fried mixed veggies - just a side order but perfect to fill your veggie minimum for the day!\\n\\nR4 - Thit xao rau xanh - another veggie and rice dish\\n\\nBasically, you cannot go wro\\nng at Noodles Ranch... I can\\'t wait to get back there soon to try the Pho - it looks pho-nominal!\\n\\nThis is another go-to place in the new hood; just make a mental note - they are closed on Mondays!\\nI know what you are thinking... why is this girl reviewing another Sports Authority?!  Well, I drive by this SA location all of the time and every now and then I pop in if I have some time to spare.  After all, I\\'m always in the market for a new workout outfit to motivate me to get to the gym!\\n\\nI recommend going to this or any SA location when in need of sports apparel, shoes, or equipment.  The selection is decent, sale racks can be great, and regular pricing is on par with most other places too...\\n\\nFor any girls that like the color PINK or are training for one of the many walks to find a cure for breast cancer, the selection of PINK apparel is pretty good right now and they have some really cute stuff to choose from in Nike, Addidas, Puma, Champion, Under Armour, and more!\\n\\nParking at this\\n location is easy as it\\'s a shopping center with plenty of spots to choose from.\\nMy first shabu experience!\\n\\nThank you Misti and Bobby for taking me to Shabu Shabu Paradise on Sunday night when I arrived to Vegas...\\n\\nFrom the salad to the seconds and thirds of veggies, I really enjoyed the meal.  I went with Jack (Single Portion) #2 - Large Shrimp Shabu-Shabu ($20).  It was a lot of food, and so much fun to cook up myself.  I enjoyed the dipping sauces too.  The nice thing about this cuisine is that despite eating a lot, I didn\\'t feel overly full.  The food is pretty light, which I love!\\n\\nI will have to return, however, as I just read on Wikipedia that \"Once the meat and vegetables have been eaten, leftover broth from the pot is customarily combined with the remaining rice, and the resulting soup is usually eaten last.\" ---- I didn\\'t know this!  I left all of the leftover broth instead of eating it like soup!\\n\\nWe skipped dessert and opted instead to treat ourselves to foot massages.  W\\nhat a fabulous night!\\nThe Scottsdale Green Belt is a paved walking and bike path that I\\'ve been spending a lot of time on since our move to Old Town Scottsdale.  Minnie and I take our morning and evening walks on the Green Belt and sometimes, we\\'ll even run or walk all the way to the dog park via the Green Belt!\\n\\nThere\\'s something special about taking a nice long walk, run, or ride on the Green Belt; especially when the sun is shining, the golfers are out, and the fresh air fills your lungs...\\n\\nJust watch out, because some people on the Green Belt are very serious about their activities.  You\\'ll want to adhere to proper Green Belt Etiquette and stay to the right side of the trail so that others can pass with you without having to scream \"on your left\" or honk their loud obnoxious bike horns at you to get out of their way!\\nI\\'ve been to this threading salon on two occasions and left satisfied both times... \\n\\nThe ladies who work here are friendly and really great at their trade.  They are\\n meticulous with getting every last hair, shaping those brows perfectly, etc... and pricing is more than fair.  The place is clean too.\\n\\nThe only negative is that if you walk-in, there\\'s no guarantee you won\\'t have to wait.  Regardless, it\\'s worth the wait and I\\'ll look forward to returning when I\\'m ready to clean up those brows once again!\\nThings that I am thankful for:\\n-family (including my husband and my new extended family that I married into and of course Minnie too)\\n-friends\\n-health\\n-an incredible job\\n-a fantastic Yelp community \\n-the fact that At One Yoga was open today and that Ian taught a fantastic power yoga class\\n\\nBecause it\\'s Thanksgiving, I figure now is as good a time as any to update my review of At One Yoga and say that it really is a fantastic studio.  I\\'m not alone in saying this... just look at their other reviews and/or look at how packed some of the classes are!\\n\\nToday\\'s class was insane.  We were literally mat to mat on the floor but that didn\\'t deter anyone at a', 'actual_label': 9, 'predicted_label': 9}, {'text': 'll... I\\'m grateful for all of the things I mentioned above and oh so much more.  I hope to continue to be blessed with the ability to practice being At One for years to come!\\nI\\'m with Norma on the to-go option at Sweet Tomatoes.  I stopped by after Yelp Office Hours today and picked up a salad to go.  (I had planned on eating at Pane Bianco but they are closed on Monday - bummer!)  Actually, for $8.22, it was a great deal!  I left with a huge salad, a side of steamed veggies, a cup of soup, a sweet potato, and an apple.  Now that is getting a bang for your buck!\\n\\nI\\'ve also eaten at other locations in the past and left feeling way too full because when you eat there, you have to take advantage of everything including the fro yo, bakery items, and more... \\n\\nI was impressed that the entire salad bar was kept clean and had many options to choose from.  I noticed for an additional fee, you can also get a side of grilled chicken now.  I didn\\'t need that though with so many other options.  \\n\\n\\nI will not be a regular at Sweet Tomatoes, anytime soon, but for the right occasion, especially when picking up \\'to-go\\' lunch, it works.  Good thing I didn\\'t read the other reviews on this location before I went, or I probably would\\'ve spent double the $$ at AJ\\'s around the corner!\\nSerious about sandwiches? I highly recommend this locally owned little lunch spot...\\n\\nI don\\'t know why it took me so long to try this place, but it was worth the wait... I ended up meeting a friend here for a spontaneous lunch, and it was delicious!\\n\\nThe large menu offers something for everyone and it\\'s all super fresh and moderately priced.  I went with the The Green Monster (veggie wrap) but had them add tuna and change out the garden spinach wrap for a honey whole wheat one.  For my side, I chose their homemade coleslaw... loved every bite!  I washed it all down with fresh squeezed lemonade (just 99 cents with the Yelp check-in offer at the moment).  \\n\\nVSC is hiding behind Andreoli Italian Grocer just off\\n the 101 and Via Linda... as it says on their website, they may be \"Outta Sight... but (they are definitely not) Outta Mind!\"  As a matter of fact, they are going to be fresh in my mind for awhile.  I can\\'t wait to return!\\nPostino does it again with this (newish) Kierland location!\\n\\nI sat outside on the patio this evening to celebrate a friend\\'s birthday... There were 4 of us and we enjoyed wine, salad and bruschetta.  All delicious!\\n\\nMy favorite bruschetta selections are the brie with apple, prosciutto fig, salami pesto, and artichoke spread.  All of these pair perfectly with the mixed green salad and Pinot Noir.  Trust me!\\n\\nThis location offers the same friendly vibe and casual, comfortable, trendy atmosphere that the others do... I live closer to the Arcadia, Safari Drive and Downtown Phoenix locations, so I\\'ll continue to go to those more often, but there\\'s nothing wrong with adding this one to the mix.  \\n\\nWhether you\\'re meeting friends, going on a date, or dining solo, you can\\'t g\\no wrong with Postino!\\nI searched Yelp to find a local courier and found Coyote Courier Services from Chris W\\'s stellar review.  I ended up using this company today to pick up an envelope and deliver it to my office.  It was $17 for a trip that would\\'ve taken me almost two hours round-trip.  I\\'d say that\\'s worth it!\\n\\nI called and spoke to Stevie on the phone to set it up.  She was friendly and made the process extremely easy... I\\'d definitely use them again.  The only reason I\\'m giving four stars instead of five is that I requested a receipt be delivered, faxed, or emailed to me.  Originally, I was told they would fax it right after the delivery, but I\\'m still waiting.\\nI\\'m always looking for breakfast/brunch options around town, so when I heard that NCounter had recently opened, I checked out their menu online and I was sold; I knew I had to go try it out.  It looks like 16 or so others beat me to the FTR and they\\'ve only been open for a week, so I guess there were plenty of other peopl\\ne excited about this new restaurant opening as well.\\n\\nI\\'m being very honest in giving a three star \"A-OK\" review, but I\\'m optimistic that after another visit or two, I\\'ll be bumping it up.  The first thing I noticed is that NCounter is located in a very convenient corner location off of Mill and 3rd St (right off the light rail).  Next off, their hours: 7am - 3:05pm daily.  Interesting!  Upon walking in, I was greeted by a bunch of friendly servers...\\n\\nI love the fast-casual concept where you order at the counter (hence the name, I suppose) and then get your drink(s) on your own but then your food is brought to you... I was torn as I looked at the menu as there were a handful of items that sounded good to me.  My internal dialogue went something like this:\\n\\n\"Mmmmm... smoothies!\"\\n\\n\"Oh wow - they serve espresso and amazing sounding coffee drinks too - very impressive but I\\'ll skip those today since I\\'m avoiding caffeine while being prego.\"\\n\\n\"Bloody Marys, Mimosas, Screwdrivers, Greyhound', 'actual_label': 9, 'predicted_label': 9}, {'text': 's, and more...\" I\\'m for sure coming back for one of those after this baby comes!\"\\n\\n\"OK - back to the food menu... those wheat germ granola pancakes sound like they\\'d be right up my alley!\"\\n\\n\"But maybe I should just go for an omelette?\"\\n\\n\"That bakery case looks pretty damn appealing too with cake pops, muffins, pastries, and more...\"\\n\\nAfter much of the above debating, I decided to order a fresh squeezed OJ and a Greek Omelette with egg whites and no onions.  For my side, I went with whole grain toast.  I grabbed my OJ and an iced water and found a table... and despite the restaurant being packed, our food arrived within 10 minutes.  \\n\\nHere\\'s where my constructive criticism comes in for NCounter: \\n-A couple of onions got thrown in there, but that\\'s forgiveable.  \\n-I suggest toasting the bread a bit more if you\\'re going to call it toast; mine was not toasted!\\n-The verbiage that is listed with the Omelettes on the menu says \"with your choice of toast, potatoes, fruit, cottage cheese or tom\\natoes.\"  So I assumed my omelette would come with my choice of one of those things.  It actually came with potatoes as well as the toast I asked for, which was a bonus, but I would\\'ve prefered to order toast and fruit or toast and cottage cheese!\\n-The artichokes on the omelette were cold but the rest of the omelette was hot - just kind of a weird combo with each bite.\\n\\nAside from the above complaints, my food was good and considering they\\'ve only been open a week, I had a very positive first experience here.  Overall, this place is awesome and a welcome addition to the hood!  I can\\'t wait to go back soon and try those pancakes... or perhaps a smoothie?!\\nI\\'ve escorted my kids to two birthday parties at this Tempe Pump It Up location in the last month... prior to that, we didn\\'t even know there was a Pump It Up other than the north Scottsdale location.\\n\\nMy kids had a blast at both parties, and I was impressed that they took the time to show the kids a safety video prior to letting them p\\nlay.  The staff are attentive to the kids needs and sure know how to show the kids a good time! \\n\\nThis location is more spacious than the Scottsdale location and offers tons of bounce house, slide and jump options for kids of all ages + some additional add-ons ie: glow in the dark nerf wars, balloon drop, etc... the staff is attentive and great with the kids.  \\n\\nBe warned though, they will rope you in by getting all of the kids to follow the birthday boy or girl to the front where they can pick out a toy at the end of the party... of course now my kids want their parties here so they can pick out a toy too!\\n\\nIn all seriousness, the facility is great and seems safe enough.  They make the parties turn-key for the adults by taking care of food and drink.  They even offer free wifi, which I took advantage of on our most recent visit.\\n\\nI am sure we\\'ll be back soon to attend another party or just to get some energy out.  Bouncing out until next time, PIU Tempe!\\nI cannot believe I haven\\'t rev\\niewed Olive & Ivy yet... I\\'ve been numerous times for brunch, lunch, and dinner too!\\n\\nAfter True Food Kitchen, Olive & Ivy is my next favorite Sam Fox concept... they offer something for everyone no matter what time of day you stop by.  Grab a coffee, breakfast, or snack anytime from the marketplace or sit down to a more leisurely meal on the restaurant side.  They offer a delicious complimentary focaccia with pesto sauce during lunch and dinner... and I\\'ve had their Mediterranean greek salad with shrimp on multiple occasions for lunch.  I\\'ve also enjoyed a fantastic omelette at Sunday brunch - (yes - they will do egg whites) and fresh fish for dinner if I recall correctly too.  In addition, O&I offers a delicious flatbread selection (great for sharing) as well as a fantastic wine list.\\n\\nOlive & Ivy seems to always have some kind of crowd, so depending on the size of your group, you may want to call ahead.\\n\\nTammar P and I had no problem getting a table when we met for a late lunch toda\\ny.  We both went with the Greek salad (she with chicken and me with shrimp) and devoured it.  We declined the focaccia and dessert, so it was the perfect healthy yet filling lunch. I was glad we were on the same page with that!\\n\\nEstelle was our server and she was fabulous... she informed us that we ordered correctly today because during the month of April, when you purchase a Mediterranean Salad, O&I will donate 50% of the purchase to Waste Not (which delivers more than 5,000 lbs of food daily to a diverse group of agencies that feed the hungry, including schools, daycare centers, after-school programs, senior care facilities, transition homes and rehabilitation centers).  Sure makes me feel better about spending $20 per person on lunch!\\n\\nI\\'m sure I\\'ll continue to rely on Olive & Ivy for many a fabulous meal ahead!\\nWhile I know you can never truly be safe from crime, I definitely feel better when I\\'m home now, knowing that we have a solid alarm system in place.  I have JPG to thank for', 'actual_label': 9, 'predicted_label': 9}, {'text': ' that safe feeling!\\n\\nAfter reading the Yelp reviews for JPG, and hearing of more and more break-ins in our neighborhood, I made it a priority to call JPG.  Jim came out several days later for a consultation, and our alarm system was installed shortly after that.\\n\\nEveryone I spoke to and worked with at JPG was friendly, customer service oriented, and knowledgeable.  The technician that came out to do the installation took his time doing so, and made sure that I understood exactly how to use all of the features before he left.  They use the best technology on the market right now, and while you do pay a premium, it\\'s worth it in my eyes.\\n\\nWe\\'ve had our alarm system for several months now and are happy with it... no issues at all.  I definitely recommend this company.\\nScottsdale Fashion Square Shrimp Salad.  That\\'s what I ordered both times I lunched at Fred\\'s and both times I was extremely satisfied!  I was also impressed with the friendly and attentive service and the welcoming, fun atm\\nosphere of the restaurant.\\n\\nI must admit, I was hesitant to eat at Fred\\'s - I had an image of snooty staff and crazy expensive menu items.  But this image in my head was proved wrong when I went in for happy hour several months ago; i had a very pleasant experience.  And then with so many four and five star Yelp reviews, I just had to make my way back for lunch!\\n\\nTry their flavored iced tea - it\\'s really refreshing and tasty... and the fresh bread they serve adds just the right carb deliciousness to the meal. I recommend dipping it in the olive oil on the table.\\n\\nI look forward to returning to Fred\\'s for brunch and/or dinner. And while I overheard someone say that Fred\\'s has the best Creme Brulee in the world, that Meyer Lemon Square sounds more up my alley!\\n\\n***Oh, and a pointer for those that don\\'t want to be tempted to shop at Barney\\'s if you decide to dine at Fred\\'s.  Park out front on the Camelback side of the building and go straight to Fred\\'s via the elevator outside. It\\'s worke\\nd for me so far... it\\'s a treat enough to dine at Fred\\'s (as it will cost you a pretty penny).\\nScrew you, CVS... I found a pharmacy to fill my prescription in a timely manner, and the staff members that helped me out were friendly and got the job done.  \\n\\nAfter having a prescription faxed to my local CVS yesterday morning, I went in a few hours later to pick it up.  I was in a time crunch as I was heading to the airport to catch a flight to (you guessed it) - Cleveland!  But unfortunately, my script wasn\\'t ready and the fellow at CVS wasn\\'t nice about it either.\\n\\nSo, I asked the lovely Cara L for a pharmacy suggestion and she referred me to the fine folks at Rite Aid.  I\\'d never filled a Rx at Rite Aid before, but they asked me up front (on the phone) for all of the info they needed to transfer it, and sure enough... it was ready several hours later when I arrived!\\n\\nAccording to Cara, there are some shady folk that frequent this drugstore, but the nasty weather must\\'ve scared them away\\n last night as the store had very few customers when we were there.  Yaya, the woman working behind the pharmacy counter, was sweet as could be, and I only owed a $10 copay.  Bonus!  Now, let\\'s just hope these meds kick in asap!\\nSo, it\\'s been almost a year since my FTR on Salon Ami... and Ashley Scott is still doing wonders with my hair!  \\n\\nI saw Ashley again today for highlights and I can\\'t tell you how many compliments I\\'ve gotten both on the cut and color.  \\n\\nI know at least a handful of friends and fellow yelpers that have gone to see Ashley and they are all extremely thankful to have found her.  Like Kelly S says, Ashley is gifted... If you are looking for a fantastic stylist, go see Ashley at Salon Ami!\\nI\\'ve been to the Arizona Science Center more than a handful of times over the years... it\\'s a fabulous local destination for kids (and adults) of all ages.  It\\'s also an incredible event venue and hosts all kinds of adult parties throughout the year.  Yelp has hosted a few incredi\\nble events here over the years too.  Don\\'t miss their Adult Nights Out for a date night alternative!\\n\\nI love that the attractions (some permanent and some that change often),  and films, so every time we go, there is something new to explore. The staff is always super friendly and helpful too.  \\n\\nI\\'m bummed we missed the Pompeii exhibit (today is literally the last day, so if you\\'re reading this, and interested, head over there now!) On a recent visit, however, we saw the volcano film in the Dorrance Planetarium and enjoyed it.  We also loved that when that film was over, we went for a \"rollercoaster ride.\"  \\n\\nMy kids, 5 and 6, were entertained for more than 2 hours on our visit-- we explored each floor and had a blast.  It\\'s the perfect way to escape the summer heat and do something educational and fun together.  We can\\'t wait to go back soon and look forward to also exploring the new CREATE Makerspace too!\\nYummy Yummy Asian Food is now sitting in my tummy tummy.  I thought for sure I', 'actual_label': 9, 'predicted_label': 9}, {'text': '\\'d get the FTR on this one, but Adam and Norman beat me to the punch... I\\'m always excited to see new restaurants open up in my hood, especially ethnic restaurants.  So after dinner at Noodles Ranch last week, I picked up a menu from this place.\\n\\nAnd when my hunger struck this evening, I decided to call in and place an order for take out.  Good thing I decided to take out instead of eat in, because this restaurant has no ambiance at all.  It was empty on a Saturday night and reminded me of the fast food Chinese places you see at food courts in malls.  The people working there were not very welcoming either... and when I suggested they add an eggplant dish to the menu, they basically just said \\'no\\' without even entertaining the idea.\\n\\nWhen I came home with my bag, I noticed that they didn\\'t include chopsticks, utensils, napkins, soy sauce or fortune cookies.  What Chinese restaurant have you ever been to that didn\\'t have fortune cookies?  \\n\\nAnyways, I ordered the Mu Shu Vegetable and th\\ne Mixed Vegetable with Shrimp in the \"Health Food Section\" of the menu.  I probably would not describe either dish as \"yummy yummy,\" but they were satisfactory. The portions were large and the vegetables were fresh, but the garlic sauce that came with the shrimp dish was pretty nasty.  \\n\\nI would possibly give this place another chance in the future for take-out in a pinch, but I\\'d highly recommend hitting up Noodles Ranch, Tottie\\'s, or Lao Thai if you\\'re wanting yummy yummy Asian food instead.\\nI went to OT\\'s for lunch the other day and had a good experience.  Although I\\'ve lived and/or worked near the 24th and Camelback  area for several years now, this was my first time in.  I finally went because my dining companion suggested we meet there.  \\n\\nService was attentive and it was the perfect place for a business lunch.  I had the Oriental Chicken Salad and they accommodated my request for holding the wontons and adding avocado.  I liked that it included mango and the miso dressing was de\\nlicious!  My friend had the french onion soup to start and the BBQ Pulled Pork Panino sandwich.  He seemed to enjoy it.  He picked up the bill (lucky me), but I think it was moderately priced - maybe even a bit expensive for what we received.  The portions were not huge and we were not offered a bread basket that I recall.\\n\\nRegardless, this was ideal for our lunch meeting...  we didn\\'t have to wait and we could hear each other speaking.  They validate your parking in the garage so it\\'s pretty convenient as well.  I\\'d like to go back on a Friday or Saturday night to experience their live entertainment and perhaps another selection from their dinner menu... but until then, 3 stars is the rating I give to OT\\'s.  It was good - nothing more, nothing less!\\nThe Farm is a perfect place for a romantic picnic, a group, a family, and I imagine even an escape if you want some alone time... the grounds are well kept and beautiful.  Dog friendly also.\\n\\nThe only reason I am not giving it 5 stars is b\\necause they run out of salads that are on the menu if you get there later in the afternoon... (I guess they only make a certain # of salads per day so if you snooze, you lose!)  However, sandwiches are made to order and delicioius...  The iced tea is really good here, and so are all of the deserts.  \\n\\nSince it\\'s located so close to South Mountain, I recommend going for a hike before and working up an appetite before heading over to the Farm for lunch.\\n\\nThere are picnic tables, or you can bring a blanket.  I went with a group of people last weekend and we brought a football to play catch... we had a blast!  Make sure you call ahead for their hours of operation.  As I recall, they close at 3pm on Sundays and they will kick you out if they have to because I think there is a gate or fence they close as well.\\nI finally made it to Drip this past Thursday... \\nI chose to go there because they were participating in Dining Out For Life and they were centrally located downtown.  And since I\\'d nev\\ner been, I figured it would be a great place to host April Office Hours.\\n\\nI called ahead to give a heads up that our group would be in, and they seemed concerned that the space would not be big enough.  It was fine though!  We took over the main room.  Gina took good care of our group.\\n\\nI saw some of the food that they served and it looked pretty good...  some interesting sandwiches for a coffee shop including one with egg, asparagus, and prosciutto.  I however, went with an iced tea and a sparkling water.  \\n\\nNote to self - honey doesn\\'t mix well in iced tea.  Mix honey into the hot tea next time before pouring over ice!  \\n\\nSince I don\\'t live in the area, I probably won\\'t be making a special trip to Drip anytime again soon, but if I did, I could see stopping by more often.\\nI didn\\'t really have expectations going in to this spa.  I was given a gift card to use from a friend of mine and was just excited to have $50 off my service.  I was extremely impressed; here\\'s why:\\n\\n1 - I love that ', 'actual_label': 9, 'predicted_label': 9}, {'text': \"they have a private parking lot and the entire building is just The Lamar Everyday Spa facility (not a strip mall or huge hotel like most spas are in this state).\\n\\n2 - Front desk staff was all smiles and they were professional also.  Casey was working when I walked in and could not have been sweeter or more efficient when giving me a tour.  (Make sure to arrive at least 10 minutes early so you are not rushed when you go).\\n\\n3 - Amenities!  Not only did the relaxation area have plenty of magazines, water, tea, fruit, cookies, etc... but the bathroom had razors, toothpaste, shower caps, and more.  (I realize that most spas do have these things, but I just didn't expect it for some reason).  They also have a pool, jacuzzi, sauna, and steam.  \\n\\n4 - I've had several facials in my life and never really enjoyed them too much; I usually prefer massages no question.  However, this facial was awesome!  My estetician was Ellen - she was fantastic!  I loved that the facial included a hand massage a\\ns well as face massage - she even got my chest, neck, and shoulders too.  Plus, the bed was really comfortable - just the right temperature!  It was extremely relaxing and I feel like my skin was glowing when I left!\\n\\nThere are plenty of details that I'm sure I'm forgetting, but you get the point - this was a really great spa!  \\n\\n***One thing to note:  the locker-room area, waiting room, pool, etc... actually everything is CO-ED!  Make sure you bring a bathing suit and keep your robe on :)  Come to think of it, if you can get your guy to accompany you, I bet this could be a fun couple activity too!\\n\\n****I am told that the first Wednesday of every month is 2 for 1 night.  I believe it's from 6-9 and if you bring a friend, you get both treatments for the price of one.  They may even have appetizers and music as well.  (Ellen told me about this during my facial, so I could've been dreaming but I'm pretty sure this is what she told me... call for details!).  Any volunteers to be my first g\\nuest one of these months?  Let me know!  I'll be back for sure!\\nI finally made it to Maizie's for lunch last Tuesday.  It was hopping, but my party of 2 got lucky and didn't have to wait for a table to open up.  We received a warm welcome and all of the staff including our waitress, Sarah, and Maizie herself went out of their way to make sure we were happy with our experience.  This place defines a locally owned boutique restaurant... it's great!\\n\\nThe space is small, but adorable!  Very hip and modern yet has a laid back and fun energy going on.  There were a mix of people (young and old, business and casual) enjoying their lunches while we were there.  Although we didn't indulge, the wine list looked extensive for such a small place, so I'll have to return for that!  \\n\\nI ordered the Krazy Kobb salad - it was a really big portion.  I will admit, I didn't love the oriental salad dressing, but Sarah brought out the sherry vinaigrette as an alternative that I liked better.  I think I will\\n try something different next time though; it still didn't blow me away.  I am sure it won't be a problem finding something since their menu is pretty diverse.  Maybe I should've taken advantage of the fact that I was there on a Tuesday - they have a 'Taco Tuesdays' special where you can order $2.50 tacos that are served with rice & beans, $2.50 Dos XX and Corona, and $3.50 margaritas!\\n\\nSo, Maizie's had great energy and plenty of food/drink to choose from.  I don't think i ordered right this first visit, but you live and learn.  I look forward to returning to try some of the other menu items; maybe even Sunday Brunch!\\nUpscale nail boutique... I had to think about it for a while - other than the normal chop shop salons that I normally go to, I've only gotten mani/pedis at resorts that are ridiculously overpriced and usually don't even do as good a job as the chop shops i frequent...\\n\\nSo, after seeing the convenient location right in my neighborhood and the positive reviews that came bef\\nore this one, I decided to give Sundrops a shot...\\n\\nIt was adorable inside - you can tell that a lot of thought was put into the design of this salon / boutique.  They have really cute clothing, shoes, and accessories for sale.  They also have several lines of polish to choose from including OPI, Essi, and more.  They have great customer service and offer you water during your service along with recent magazines to choose from.  I could tell that they follow strict sanitation guidelines which made me feel good as well.  \\n\\nThey couldn't squeeze me in the first attempt, so I decided to make an appointment... this is probably your best bet.  Also, I was going to book the 'petite pedi' and they warned me that this is a 30 minute treatment and does not include a soak.  So, I bumped it up a bit (that soak was appealing to me) and wen tfor the 'Island Indulgence.'  For $35, it was a treat... everything smelled delicious from the coconut milk bath to the cane sugar scrub and the lotion they ma\", 'actual_label': 9, 'predicted_label': 9}, {'text': 'ssaged on my feet before polishing.  I walked away feeling relaxed and happy with the decision.\\n\\nI also noticed that you can have parties at this hot spot... which gets me thinking - yelp event?  hmmm....\\nSo sad that I have to update and take my rating down several stars...\\nIt seems that since my review in November 2007, the majority of the stores I enjoyed shopping at are no longer open.\\n\\nI\\'ve been in to window shop at a few that are still there but haven\\'t been wowed at all.  The best thing that the Mix Shops has to offer now?  Karve Studio.\\n\\nI hope that some fashion forward, affordable boutiques will re-open in the Mix eventually, but for now... \"Meh. I\\'ve experienced better\" is all I can say. :(\\nThanks to all of you yelpers before me who wrote such great reviews about Steve\\'s Espresso... and thanks to Alicia B. who suggested we have a bookclub meeting here too.  Otherwise, I never would\\'ve ventured out to McClintock and Baseline in Tempe.\\n\\nNot sure what else I can say other than wh\\nat a great find this is... I can\\'t speak to the coffee, but the iced tea was refreshing on a beautiful afternoon like today.  It was clean, unassuming, although there were a good amount of people there, it was quiet enough to concentrate if you needed to get work done...  there was a good energy in the air!  Drew was working the counter and was friendly - both in the store and when I called to make sure they were dog friendly (which they are if the dog stays outside).\\n\\nI didn\\'t check out the restrooms which is surprising, but I\\'ll have to do that next visit!  I\\'ll also have to try some of the scrumptious looking snacks... Since they are open until 10pm every night of the week, maybe I\\'ll go hang one evening soon!  Like Alicia, I only wish it were closer to my work/home.  Do you hear that Steve?  How about a 2nd location?\\nI attended a 2nd birthday party for yelper-in-training, Eliana L, at Scottsdale Gymnastics today.  There were a ton of kids and parents there, and everyone seemed to b\\ne having a great time.\\n\\nThe staff interacted well with the kids and got them to play games, take pictures, and even use hand sanitizer prior to heading into the main room for lunch.  \\n\\nThe facility is larger than you can imagine, clean enough, and appears to be a great place for a kids\\' birthday party... with Baby M arriving any day now, I am trying to find places that may be appealing for playdates, classes, etc... down the road, and I will definitely keep this place in mind.\\nI saw Natalie\\'s car one evening on a day when I was feeling particularly big (if you know what I mean)... I took a mental note of her company name (it was marked all over her car) and went home to do some research... I found her website and her blog... and then I saw she\\'d claimed her business on Yelp so I figured it was a sign... and I gave her a call!\\n\\nA few days later, Natalie was at my house for my free consultation.  It was good timing, since I\\'d just found out I had a tax refund coming, so she sold me... an\\n eighteen session package!\\n\\nI wanted to wait until I could boast a major weight loss before writing this review... but I cannot wait any longer to share Natalie with the rest of you.  While I have yet to see major results, I can say with confidence that Natalie / Fitness Elements is fantastic.  She pours her heart and soul into her business and it\\'s evident.  \\n\\nI know that if I followed Natalie\\'s nutrition and fitness plan (as I am supposed to be doing), I would already be at my goal weight.  Instead, I\\'ve had some challenges with travel, eating out, drinking, etc... At least that is what I am calling my excuses for now.\\n\\nI\\'m hoping to buckle down and stick to the program so I will see results moving forward.  I\\'m continuing to meet with Natalie on a weekly basis - i recommend meeting with her more often if your financial situation and schedule allows.\\n\\nI\\'ll keep you posted on my progress!  \\n\\nAnd in the meantime, please do not peer pressure me into eating fattening food, drinking, etc.\\n.. I mean it!  I\\'ve got a wedding that is approaching quickly, and I want to be a skinny bride!\\nOn the prowl for some new socks for the baby, I popped in here the other day.  I was pleasantly surprised by the selection.  They have tons of cute clothes for babies and kids of all ages.  \\n\\nI found what I was looking for and was happy to see that the (six pack) socks I found were on sale for \"buy one get one 50% off.\"  However, even with the sale price, I thought $26 for 12 pairs of tiny socks seemed a bit pricey.  \\n\\nNonetheless, I liked this store.  The employees were friendly enough, there is plenty of cute clothing to choose from, and there is plenty of parking outside of the store as well.  I\\'m sure I\\'ll return eventually, but not for awhile as at the time of this writing, Baby M has everything he needs and more!\\nI wouldn\\'t dare compare any of our delis in the Valley to those you\\'ll find in New York.

To be honest I\\'m not a huge fan of barbecue and I found Hap\\'s Pit Barbecue to be just kind of average. \\n\\nOn this visit I ordered the pulled pork sandwich and my lunch companions ordered the barbecue chicken salad, cornbread, chopped brisket, and chopped ham. \\n\\nMy lunch companion said that the chopped brisket was excellent and the ham and bbq chicken salad  were just so-so.  However, the cornbread was dry.\\n\\nThe service was slow, really slow, with just one person at the cash register and one person cooking. It took some time to place our order and some time to receive our orders. All in all an average lunch.\\nIt\\'s been a while but it\\'s still good.\\n\\n\\nIf you like  ice cream (and who doesnt) and you are not afraid of the calories.

Coldstone has good  Ice cream and you get to create\\n your own custom ice-cream creation. \\n\\nAs we entered the store we were greeted with a loud \"Hello\".  There was a\\n bit of a long line however, the folks at Coldstone  kept the line moving.  As we waited in line, it was obvious that the staff at Cold Stone enjoyed working there and working with each other. \\n\\nWhen it was our turn we were served and given suggestions by the staff.

There\\'s  a lot to do at Lucie\\'s, from the giant \"beer pong\" styled volleyball, pool, dancing, and even \\n\\nThe drink prices are amazing and the staff are very friendly, not a bad place to grab a beer.\\nA tasty and quick lunch.\\n\\nI was driving by Orgnaos this afternoon and decided to stop by and\\n grab a quick lunch. The hostess seated me immediately and I was served my drink and given a menu within a few minutes.. \\n\\nThe staff at Oreganos are friendly and accomdating. My entree was prepared and served quicker then expected. Today I ordered the stuffed crust pizza, and a salad.  The salad was served cold, and the ingredients were fresh. The pizza was good, but not the best I ever had at Oreganos (little soggy). \\n\\nThe prices are a bit higher than average, but not unreasonable. I look forward to my next visit.\\nCrepes, just so good.\\n\\nFresh hot brewed coffee and free Wi-Fi aren\\'t the only reasons I have to get my IHop fix.

From the Sweedish, Nutella, to the strawberry with cream cheese Ihop will surley have a crepe to satisfy your cravings .

The restaurant might not look like much from the outside but like the old adage goes \"You can\\'t judge a book by its cover\" the same can be said about The Original Hamburger Works. \\n\\nThe Original Hamburger Works has a sports bar vibe and inviting atmosphere, with lots of TV\\'s that show sports all over the restaurant, and the restaurant  is spacious, well kept, and clean.\\n\\nThe burgers are big, fresh, and made to order. You select what size burger you want, type of cheese, and type of bun, and then the fun begins.\\n\\nThe Original Hamburger Works offers a condiment wagon filled with various burger fixens.  The condiments bar is a nice addition because your simply given your flame grilled burger and bun and the rest is up to you.  So be prepared to pile on the \"fixins\" at no extra charge.\\n\\nGreat foo\\nd, reasonable prices, and amazing customer service.  What more could you ask for.\\nGreat service, arrived at 8 am due to an eye infection.  I wasn\\'t sure how long I would have to wait, we all know how busy urgent care can be.  I signed in and was called back within in 10 minutes.  After taking my vitals I went into a patient room and the doctor arrived a few minutes later.  I was given my prescription and discharge instructions and was out the door by 840, not a bad deal for urgent care on a saturday.\\n\\nThe staff is friendly and helpful and doctors can address any concerns you have.  When your primary care physician isn\\'t available this is the place to go.\\nA friend of mine decided we should have Crepes for lunch, It didn\\'t take much to convince me as I love crepes, so off we went.

However, on this last visit I was a little disappointed. \\n\\nOn this visit I had the happy hour special, which consisted of egg drop soup, dumplings,  and teriyaki chicken Mind you, nothing tasted bad, its just nothing was really good either. \\n\\nI was served my \\nsoup almost immediately after I was seated, within 2 minutes my entrée was also served.  I think it would have enjoyed my entrée  had I was given  an opportunity to finish my soup. \\n\\nMaybe it was just an off day, but the food and serves were mediocre at best.\\nBarnes and Nobel is a Great Family Place to read and grab a cold drink.\\n\\nBarnes and Nobel is a good place for current titles. The staff is always helpful, friendly and courteous. As a member, I enjoy the special discounts and the great variety of \"bargain books.\"  My visit\\'s to Barnes and Nobel are always an adventure! I bring my nephew to Barnes and Nobel for family time.  We enjoy looking for books and reading.\\n\\nBarnes and Nobel is also a nice place to grab a quick bite and some coffee. Maybe get some work done or just some quite time to sit and read.\\nPretty good barbecue\\n\\nOverall, Pork on a Fork was exactly what I would expect. The food was good and everyone left happy.\\n\\nPork on a fork offers five different sauces, from mild an\\nd sweet to smoky and spicy, including a mustard-based sauce, which was pretty good. On this visit find lunch Companions and I I had the pulled pork sandwich, a brisket burrito, chicken, coleslaw, cornbread, and macaroni and cheese.\\n\\nAll of our entrees were  tasty and I really had no complaints, other than I\\'m really not a fan of bbq.  The sauce selection was good, the cole slaw was not overly sweet though underseasoned, the macaroni and cheese , waffle fries, were all okay.\\n\\nIf you\\'re in the area, and enjoy bbq, check out pork on a fork you won\\'t be disappointed.\\nSam\\'s Club or Costco.... Which To Choose.\\n\\nI have memberships at both  Costco and Sam\\'s Club . However, Sam\\'s Club is closer to my house, so when I am short on time Sam\\'s Club  is usually my choice. In General, while Sam\\'s Club and Costco offer good value I think Costco sells better products and merchandise and has better customer service.\\n\\nOn a positive note the gas at Sam\\'s Club seems to be the cheapest in town as compared t\\no the gas at my local Costco.  However, both are good clubs.\\nNew York Meets Sun City, Az\\n\\nBeing a native New Yorker, I am always on a quest for Italian bakeries in Arizona.  However, authentic Italian Bakeries are not so easy to find in Arizona. So when I came across New York West Pastry and Bake Shop I knew I hit the lottery. I found my little taste of New York in Sun City, Arizona.\\n\\nNew York West has all the typical Italian pastries, Linzer tarts, napoleon,rainbow cookies, pignoli, pie pockets, devil dogs, salt sticks, and one of my favorites sfogliatelle.  \\n\\nIn addition to absolutely delicious pastries New York West is also a full service bakery. I mean, they carry rolls, breads, bagels, and even pizza dough.   The breads and rolls are flaky, buttery and perfectly delicious. New York West has it all.\\n\\nThe customer service is second to none at New York West. It is rare to walk into a bakery that you haven\\'t been to for some time and the owner not only remembers you but recalls your f\\navorite pastry\\'s, now that\\'s what I call great customer service. All the staff at New York West are friendly, accommodating, and patient.  After all,  it can take a while to decide exactly what you want to eat. \\n\\nIf your ever in the area and want delicious pastry\\'s, stop by New York West you won\\'t be disappointed.\\nNot my first choice\\n\\nFull Service Autowash prices are very competitive. However,  I have to be honest, on more then one occasion I have been more then disappointed with the quality of the wash I received. Usually, after my wash, my vehicle has streaks on the windows, side mirrors are really ever cleaned, and tire dressing isn\\'t noticeable. If you ask one of the staff to reclean the areas, they do so without hesitation. It\\'s just frustrating to have to ask to have noticeable areas re-cleaned. This carwash is not my first choice but I guess it will do in a pinch.\\nHealthy Option\\n\\nSalad and Go Restaurants do not have indoor seating but nevertheless it\\'s a super fast and tasty con', 'actual_label': 10, 'predicted_label': 10}, {'text': 'cept with nice selections of unique salads that are very affordable. \\n\\nThe salads are so fresh and delicious and at such a great price.  A salad this good and this large would cost $15 in a restaurant however, Salad and Go charges a mere 6 bucks. If you want to add protein like chicken or shrimp (there are more choices) it is only a little more based upon the one you choose. \\n\\nSalad and Go also offers some healthy kids items on the menu so the whole family can have a tasty, healthy meal at a very reasonable price.\\nAlways a great treat\\n\\n Baskin-Robbins has always been a lot time favorite of mine.  Quality confections, quickly prepared and reasonably priced.\\n\\n The staff is always friendly and service is always fast. The hardest part of my visit is making a selection with so many flavors to choose from.\\n\\nOnce you make a selection you will have your ice cream in hand within minutes, reguardless of how busy the store is.  So if your looking for geeat icecream head to Baskin-Robbins for a  m\\nouth-watering experience.\\nRefreshingly unique\\n\\nThis was my first time stopping by the Pop n Tea Bar but it won\\'t be my last.  This place is amazing. I guess the only way to describe to describe \"Pop n Tea\" is refreshingly unique deliciousness. \\n\\nOn this visit I had the New York strawberry cheesecake, dipped in dark chocolate, and covered with crushed graham cracker crust and almonds.  It was amazing.  I can\\'t wait to find another one soon!\\nI really like QTK Nsils. They do great on manicures and pedicures. I\\'m usually very picky and often switch salons frequently. This is the only salon I have returned to and have been happy with.\\n\\nThink I found the perfect nail salon\\nThe premade sandwiches at the deli are pretty good. To be honest I was pleasantly surprised.  In fact, that sandwich was one of the better ones  I\\'ve had in a long time.\\n\\nIn addition to great sandwiches I usually can find everything that I need with no problems. The sales associates are very polite, friendly, and helpful. \\n The prices at Fry\\'s are competitive in comparison with other grocery stores in the area. \\n\\nThe Deli  service can be slow at times but is worth the wait. If you ever need a six foot sub Fry\\'s has a really nice selection to choose from and they all are delicious and reasonably priced\\nNothing Fancy Just Good Food\\n\\nI was searching  for a new Mexican Food restaurant when I came across Taqueria Don Pancho.  I have to admit, I was very pleasantly surprised.  The service  was great, and the food was delicious.\\n\\nOn this visit I had a chili relleno combo platter. The combo dinner included refried beans, which were some of the best refried beans I\\'ve eaten in a very long time, and the Relleno was perfectly prepared with fresh  green chile, not canned or frozen.\\n\\nThe salsa bar offers various salsas,  green and red sauces, both equally good tasting. If you\\'re looking for great tasting mexican food stop by, you weonr be disappointed. Great Food, nice size portions and reasonable prices.\\nHampton Inn\\n  Doesn\\'t Disappoint \\n\\n\\nA out of town  friend was scheduled for surgery and decided to stay at the Hampton Inn Phoenix Mid-Town/Downtown location. I have to say The Hampton Inn is a great place to stay.\\n\\nThe Hampton Inn is a gem, the rooms are well kept, beds are comfortable, and the staff goes out of their way to make sure your stay is enjoyable . The Hampton Inn offers complimentary breakfast, free wifi, and these absolutely delicious  cookies at the front desk each afternoon. I could have easily ate a bunch of cookie (sometimes I did just that). The rooms are really quiet so  you can rest without any noise  disturbance from your neighbors and the Inn is  located near a variety of food choices within walking distance.\\n\\nIf you are every looking for a great place to stay in the downtown area, give Hampton Inn a try.\\nTailgaters is a large restaurant, with a good separations for groups or gatherings, with a nice outdoor seating area with a propane fire-pit and patio seating (when its not\\n 110).\\n\\nThe menu at Tailgaters Sports Grill & Il Primo Pizza & Wings is large with great selection to accomadate everyone\\'s taste. Tailgaters offers daily food specials which are great wallet friendly deals. The menu at Tailgaters  has a lot of variety for a sports bar, and everything I\\'ve had there has been really good. The club sandwich is loaded, tasty, and one of my favorites and the burgers are tasty as well.\\nAlways a good choice \\n\\n\\nValero is always a great choice when it comes to refueling.  I find it a challenge to just purchase \"gas\" when I visit Valero.  I like the soda fountain station, and the  multitude of snacks Valero has to offer. I always manage to find a snack I hadn\\'t had in quite some time, and it just calls my name.\\n\\n Reasonably priced gas, ice cold drinks, and snacks, it doesn\\'t  get any better.\\nGo hungry\\n\\nBuca di Beppo is an old fashioned Italian style restaurant with a relaxed and homey feel.  This was my first visit to this Buca Di Beppo location and I have to a', 'actual_label': 10, 'predicted_label': 10}, {'text': 'dmit I was a little disappointed.  \\n\\nOn my first visit I decided to take advantage of the  take out service  rather then eating at the restruant. The small portions at Bucca  Di Beppo  are enough for at least two people if not three, so be guided accordingly. For large families, the pasta dishes looked like they would feed quite a few people, however, I tend to look for quality, not quantity.\\n\\nOn this visit I ordered the baked rigatoni, chicken Parmesan , mini meatballs, mozzarella garlic bread, and chocolate covered cannolis.  The meatballs were delicious, however the rest of the meal was average at best. The bread, pasta, and chicken dishes were soggy and not seasoned very well, maybe it\\'s something you have to eat at the restaurant.  It just wasn\\'t very good.  The Cannolis were okay, nothing special.  I guess I was expecting more.  It was disappointing at best, especially after spending 72+ dollars.\\n\\n\\nI might give Bucca Di Beppo another try at some point.\\nI\\'ll take a pass.\\n\\nThe staf\\nf at Irma\\'s Mexican Food are warm, friendly, and extremely personable, which is why I feel terrible for calling out their Mexican food as bland, tasteless, and poorly executed.\\n\\nThe food at Irma\\'s isn\\'t so much bad as it is bland, and the presentation is sloppy, even for a fast food establishment. On this visit we had the Beef Tacos and Barbacoa Sopas, all of which border on terrrible. The Barbacoa Sopas were drowned in a tastelesd red sauce with a very small amount of  diced up pieces of meat, and  topped off with a combination of cheese, grease, and more grease. The food could have been worse,  unpleasant flavors would certainly be worse than no flavor at all.\\n\\nI wasn\\'t expecting fine dining, nor was I expecting terrible Mexican dishes.\\nUsually has what I need.\\n\\nLet\\'s face it, when you need something for your home or apartment, Home Depot  is a store we think of. \\n\\nHome Depot  is the place to go for pretty much everything you could need for any home project. The prices appear to be i\\nn line with Lowes which is just down the block.\\n\\nThe store is neat, organized,  and the staff,  if you can find them are very helpful.\\n\\nMy only issue with Home Depot is the customer service, which is usually  hit-and-miss,  depending on who you\\'re lucky enough to walk up to while shopping.\\nCapriottis\\'s\\nYou haven\\'t had a sandwich until you have a Capriottis\\n\\nCapriotti\\'s Sandwich Shop is definitely the place to go for a good bite to eat. I would recommend Capriottis to anyone who is searching for something beyond \"Just a Sandwich Shop\". Capriottis is very clean and warmly decorate. The Staff is knowledgeable and very friendly.\\n\\nOn my first visit to Capriottis I had the \"Bobbie\" which is one of Capriottis signature sandwiches and for good reason. \\xa0The Bobbie is stuffed full of homemade turkey (that\\'s right, homemade roasted turkey, not processed deli meat), cranberry sauce, stuffing, and mayo. The \\'Bobbie\" sandwich was amazing to say the least. \\xa0If turkey isn\\'t for you Capriotti\\'s offers \\na variety of traditional deli sandwiches, cheese-steaks, as well as specialty sandwiches. \\xa0I plan on trying the cheese steak on my next visit.\\n\\nThe service at Capriottis is always fast & friendly. The atmosphere reminds me of that of a small-town deli sandwich shop and the food is always consistent and great. \\xa0I could keep writing everything I enjoyed but I think I have given you enough to try Capriotti\\'s for yourself! Who knows maybe I will see you there!\\nI Just ... Like This Place Alot.\\n\\nGround Control is not like any other coffee house but then again Ground Control is much more then a coffee house.  Ground Control has a relaxed feel and the food and service have always been excellent. Ground Control offers  daily and weekly specials at a very reasonable price.\\n\\nOn my very first visit to Ground Control I was drawn to the  Gelato case.  I have to admit next to a good Italian ice Gelato is my second sweet tooth weakness.  I will not  claim to be a Gelato expert, however, I have tatsed \\nmany Gelato\\'s and I can say in  confidence that Ground Controls Gelato is the real deal, this  gelato is  very good.  I always struggle choosing between the lemon or blood orange (blood orange usually wins). \\n\\nI wish I could say that  I have tried many items off the menu but that just isn\\'t the case.  The reason why I haven\\'t explored more items off the menu is because I am addicted to the  pizza, which is cooked in a wood fired oven.  The pizza at Ground Control is excellent. Try the B-B-Q it\\'s delicious (get a side order of garlic parm fries, very tasty)\\n\\nThe wine and beer lists are likewise excellent.\\nGround Control is an ideal place to visit for a leisurely and inviting meal.\\nInCREPEable\\n\\nThis morning I woke up with a craving for crepes, which aren\\'t so easy to find in the West Valley.  On the recommendation of fellow \"yelpers\" I headed to P.A.K Crepes and Coffee to satisfy my craving and I\\'m so glad I did.  \\n\\nP.A.K Crepes and Coffee are made from scratch and are absolutely delicio', 'actual_label': 10, 'predicted_label': 10}, {'text': \"us. This small little eatery located in the West Valley is serving breakfast and lunch, with a selection of wallet-friendly sweet and savory crepes, for a mere $5.25.\\n\\nP.A.K offers a variety of crepes to indulge your every craving. Theres Chicken,Turkey, Ham, Spinach, Cheese, Yogurt, and Fruit options. On this visit I had the Peach, Carmel, Pecan, and Cream crepe. I can honestly say that this is one of the best crepe I ever had. I can't wait to visit again and try the Nutella and chocolate sauce balanced with cream cheese and strawberries and bananas.\\n\\nIn addition to delicious crepes P A.K offers Hot & Iced coffee, Frappuccino, and smoothies. The Iced  White Chocolate Coffee was the perfect pairing for my crepe.\\n\\nIf you find yourself craving delicuous crepes and coffee head over to P.A.K Crepes and Coffee,  you won't be disappointed. The staff are friendly and inviting and the place has a nice casual vibe.\\nNever Disappoints \\n\\nWith so many Mexican Food Restaurants do any really stand ou\\nt above the rest?  If you have to ask that question then you have never been to Raul and Teresa's.\\n\\nThe West Valley has had its share of good Mexican restaurants.  So what makes Raul and Theresa's stand out? For starters, it's not the typical version of Mexican food drowned in sauce,  rice, and heavy beans. The dishes at Raul and Theresa's are excellent. The entrees are flavorful, served hot, and plated perfectly. Today, I had the taco and enchilada lunch combo and it was delicious.\\n\\nRaul and Theresa's has two locations, one on Litchfield Road and the original location off of M-85 ( I prefer the M-85 location).  \\n\\nRaul and Theresa's has a very relaxed atmosphere, plenty of room for large parties, and is kid friendly.  The service and food  is absolutely wonderful. If your in the area and hungry for Mexican Food stop by Raul a d Theresa's  you will not be disappointed.\\nCompare Department Stores\\n\\n\\nKohl's may not be my favorite store however, the customer service is bar none, and the retu\\nrn policy can't be beat. \\n\\nI have never had any problems with anything I've purchased at any of the Kohl's store or their online services. Kohl's offers great prices and sales. I usually take advantage of theor 30% off coupons.  I have a lot of family and friends who shop at Kohl's, and they are always pleased . The quality is great for the price.\\nGreat Wash\\n\\nI was planning on selling my car however,  I didn't want to spend a lot of money on a detail, so I decided to get the Ultra Wash and I'm sure glad that I did. \\n\\nMy nephew and his friends  had been riding in my car and there were spilled cherry icees, french fry grease stains and numerous other stains that I thought would never come out. The folks at Superstar took such great care and attention to detail. When I got my car back, it was beautiful and looked just like it did when I first bought my car. \\n\\nI was extremely pleased and surprised. It was obvious Superstar takes pride in their work. Even the dealership mentioned how great \\nmy car looked when I went to trade it in.  I'm definitely coming back to Superstar with my new vehicle.\\nWing Stop. by far has some of the best wings in the state. \\n\\nIf you're a fan of wings, then you need to go to Wing Stop and pick up a dozen or maybe even two dozen right this second. My sister and I go to wing stop often and we have never had a bad expeirence.\\n\\nThe wings at Wing Stop are 100% all white meat, served to order piping hot.  The wings are crispy, moist, and of descent size. The Hawaiian, and Garlic Parmesan were delicious and happen to be my two of my favorites. The Hawaiian styles wing have just the right amount of tangy sweetness and parmesan cheese adds just the right finishing touch. \\n\\nWhat I like best about Wing Stop is that  you are allowed to Mix and match your orders. You can combine regular wings and boneless wings together. Usually, I order a combination of both.  However, bone in traditional is my favorite. I could have ate a few dozen by myself but decided I p\\nrobably should share.\\n\\nEverytime I go to Wing Stop I order the homestyle fries which are cut fresh daily. The fries are crispy and golden brown and very tasty.  My sister isnt a fan of fries but enjoys the homemade potato salad, and fresh baked rolls. The rolls are fresh, hot, buttery, and absolutely delicious. \\n\\nThe prices are reasonable and the food is great. If you decided to eat at Wing Stop arrive early because there is limited seating. \\n\\nThe staff at Wing Stop are friendly and helpful. So stop by and give them a try.\\nI won't be going back anytime soon.\\n\\nWe have ordered from Papa John's numerous times in the past and they generally do an OK job. However, my last few visits to Papa John's the customer service has been poor and the pizza has been cold,soggy, and inedible.\\n\\nOn this particular occasion I placed a phone order to be picked up at 4pm. I thought 50% off, can't go wrong with that. So I ordered pizza for everyone. \\n\\n1 large thin crust pepperoni, sausage, and bacon.\\n\\n2  medi\", 'actual_label': 10, 'predicted_label': 10}, {'text': 'um original crust pepperoni pizzas.  \\n\\nI Arrived at the store at 403.  The store was empty but the empoyees were busy. I waited by the front counter even tho several employees looked at me not one acknowledged I was there for 5 minutes.  Finally,  a employee came up to the counter and assisted me. \\n\\nAs a I paid for my order and grabbed my pizzas I noticed that the top boxes were hot but the bottom box was cold.  I asked the cashier if the pizza was sitting out very long and she replied \" I\\'m not sure but I don\\'t think so\". I opened the cold box of pizza and the pizza looked unappetizing and old.\\n\\nThe employee offered to make a pizza replacement.   So I was left with the decision to wait 15 minutes for one new pizza and allow the two other pizzas to get cold.  So I  made the decission and waited. Once my pizza was ready I headed home.\\n\\nThe large pizza was good the two pepperoni pizza were absolutely terrible.  The pizza were now cold, soggy , and once again unappetizing.  No one ate the\\n pizza and they went straight to the trash.  \\n\\nThere are a variety of pizza restaurants in my neighborhood and even though they do not offer 50 percent off. I still consider them a better option. I won\\'t be going back to Papa Johns anytime soon.\\nExcellent customer service and very friendly staff\\n\\nI started going to Fast and Friendly 2 Carwash after my favorite carwash closed its doors . While I definitely agree that Fast and Friendly takes longer than other car washes I\\'ve visited, however, it is definitely worth the wait.  \\n\\nFast and Friendly is committed to giving the customer what they want, a great car wash at a reasonable price. Fast and Friendly is committed to making each customer happy and satified. Give Fast and Friendly a try you won\\'t be disappointed.\\nDon\\'t judge a book by its cover.\\n\\n\\nI guess the saying must be true \"You can\\'t judge a book by its cover\".  The  exterior at Alfonso\\'s is unassuming, the restaurant is very clean, the service is efficient, and I cannot say enoug\\nh about the food.  Alfonso\\'s Mexican Food is a delicious surprise.  \\n\\nAlfonso\\'s offers a large variety of great menu choices. Alfonso\\'s does not have table service, so you order your entrée  at the counter, pick up your food, and take it to your table.  The food is not what you would call \"fast\" food but carefully prepared food would be a better choice of words.\\n\\nOn this visit I had the shredded beef and ground beef tacos and both were really very good and seasoned perfectly. My lunch companion had the Carne Asada Burrito and he said it was the best he\\'s ever had. The burritos at Alfonso\\'s are huge, inexpensive, and most important, delicious. \\n\\nIf your ever in the area stop by Alfonso\\'s. The food is authentic and will not disappoint.\\nNot bad\\n\\nMaryln\\'s Fish and Chips has a very large menu. They offer everything from fish, shrimp, wings, chicken strips, burgers, sandwiches, clam strips, calamari, oysters, fried chicken and all the usual fried side items.  \\n\\nMaryln\\'s offers three kinds of\\n fish, Cod, catfish, and tilapia.  I ordered the two piece cod.  My entree came with a side of fries.  The combo and a drink was a little under $10.  The meal was good. The fish was served hot and fresh as were the fries.  As I said the fish was good,  just nothing really stood out, it was a typical fried fish. Marylin\\'s even offers four different flavors of Kool-Aide, I haven\\'t seen that in many fish places. I think my nephew would enjoy their drink selection.\\n\\nThe staff at Marlyin\\'s are very friendly and accomdating and they have a menu online and you can order for delivery.\\nGood Comfort Food\\n\\nI don\\'t frequent Boston Market often but when I do the food is always good. Your greeted the moment you walk in the door.  \\n\\n The staff is extremely friendly and helpful and even came to check on us during our meal - like we were eating at a full-service restaurant.\\n\\nThe chicken and meatloaf were  juicy and delicious and the mashed potatoes reminded me of the kind we make at home. You can get a\\n good tasting meal at a reasonably priced.\\n\\n Awesome comfort food!!\\nSimply Fresh and Delicious.\\n\\nRecently, my friends and I went to GreenMix for lunch. GreenMix resembles a cafeteria-style Restaurant, with fresh salads, soups, and sandwiches. We were greeted by the staff as we made our way to the counter. I choose to create my own salad  and it was delicious. Iceberg lettuce, chicken, apples, cranberries, asiago cheese, topped with cinnamon pecans and homemade pomegranate dressing.  My lunch companions had the Korean BBQ Beef and they both said the Korean  BBQ Neefwas one of the best wraps they ever had.  I think on my next visit I will have to try the Korean BBQ Beef myself. \\n\\nThe service is friendly and quick with no lunch line hold up. Plenty of seating with  employees who happily picked up our empty plates.  An excellent option for a quick, or leisurely, lunch that won\\'t put a dent in your wallet.\\nAlways Good\\n\\nI have visited Dickey\\'s a few times and I\\'ve never been disappointed. Th', 'actual_label': 10, 'predicted_label': 10}, {'text': \"e food is always good, service is always great, and the restaurant  is always clean.\\n\\nOn this visit we shared a nice variety of smoked chicken, ribs, brisket, macaroni and cheese, potato salad, cold slaw, and hot rolls. \\n\\nDickey's is reasonably priced and good value for the buck\\nA fun place for good food and games\\n\\nJJs Grill is a fun place to meet with friends/family and enjoy good food. JJ's Grill has a variety of billiards, dart boards, poool tables, TV's,  and games to keep everyone entertained.\\n\\nOn this visit my friends and I shared Fried zucchini and ranch dressing, honey barbecue wings, fish and chips basket, and a club sandwich.  All our entrees were  fresh and seasoned just right. The price was also great, the staff was friendly and the place was very clean!  I cant wait to visit again.\\nA nice visit \\n\\nI was very excited when Orrganos Pizza Bistro opened a Westside location.   I had tried several times to have lunch at the Goodyear's location, however every time, we ran into a l\\nengthy wait for a table and choose not to wait.\\n\\nI was driving by late afternoon on a weekday and decided to stop by and try my luck. The hostess advised of a 20 minute wait and we were seated within 10 minutes. \\n\\nThe staff is friendly and accomdating. Although, on this visit service was a little slow.  However, the food was prepared and served quicker then expected. We split garlic bread, stuffed crust pizza, and a salad.  The salad was served cold, and the ingredients were fresh. The pizza was good, but not the best I ever had at Oreganos (little soggy). \\n\\nThe prices are a bit higher than average, but not unreasonable. I look forward to my next visit.\\nA Really Good HotDog.\\n\\nI have never been a big fan of hot dogs however, my nephew is so off to Teds we went.  The line at Ted's was long but moved quickly  ( don't let the length of people waiting in line be discouraging). As your waiting in line the  person on the grill will ask you what you would like to order, it's not really shoutin\\ng but more of a long distance conversation. I actually found ordering that way to be kind of fun.\\n\\nThe hotdogs are shipped in from Buffalo, NY. The charbroiled hot dog have a great flavor and there are so many toppings to choose from. I had one with homemade chili, cheese and onions. It was fantastic. I especially liked the chili. I also ordered the onion rings and they were also very good so if you like hotdogs give Ted's a try.\\nNice spot.... out of the ordinary.\\n\\nFair Trade Cafe has a laid back vibe and the food and coffee are pretty good. Fair Trade Cafe  is small but they have a shaded patio in the back, with a fountain, it is a really nice area to sit down and just relax.\\n\\nThe Fair Trade Café has a rather strange menu that would certainly lean towards the healthy, vegan crowd.  However, I was able to find a ham and cheese sandwich and latte, that were tasty and the bajed goods are definitely worth trying.\\n\\nThe servers are nice, however, service can be  slow at times. If you're eve\\nr in the area you should give it a try you won't be disappointed.\\nGreat prices and exceptional customer service\\n\\nAfter spending the entire day shoping for furnirure I was exhausted when it was time to shop for a new mattress. \\n\\nAll I needed was a mattress, and then I would be done, how challenging can purchasing a mattress  be, after all it's just a mattress.  How wrong was I.  Matress shopping might sounds easy but there are lots of options and it is easy to get confused.  At Mattress Firm Jesus cleared all my confusion and  I found  exactly what I was looking for, for half the price I would have paid somehere else and the quality of the mattress was exxeptional.\\n\\nMattress Firm doesn't have any fancy displays or bedroom set ups.  All Matress Firm has is mattress's.  What I enjoyed most about matress firm; their were no high pressure sales pitches.  Jesus gave me the information about mattress sets and then let me make the decission.  When I made my purchase I notices I was $29.89 shor\\nt and Jesus took additional money of the purchase price. With great prices and exceptional customer service I'll be back again.\\nSo much more than just your neighborhood Pub\\n\\nSaddle Mountain Brewing Company is a pleasant alternative to the everday sports bar you will find all over the valley. Sure, Saddle Mountain offers the same typical bar food like most sports bars, but Saddle Mountain has a much more relaxed atmosphere, and that's a challenge to find in your local sports bars. \\n\\nIn addition, to the great atmosphere, Saddle Mountain offers really good food and the service is good. Would I consider Saddle Mountain to be a four-star restaurant? No. However, they do serve a pretty good corned beef and pastrami.  Just the proper ratio of meat to kraut and cheese; served on a good sized marbled rye bread.\\n\\nThe beer selection is great.  I would recommend getting a flight of beer so you can sample.  The prices are reasonable, and the staff is friendly. Not a bad way to spend time with frien\", 'actual_label': 10, 'predicted_label': 10}, {'text': \"ds and family.\\nLa Grande Orange - LGO - The Big O\\n\\nLGO is one of the best places for breakfast in Phoenix.  Recently, I visited LGO for brunch and I am so glad I did. I have found a new favorite restaurant when I want to grab a pizza, sandwich, or delicious sweet treat.  \\n\\nYou can't help from noticing the long line of patrons gathering for their morning fix at La Grande Orange, but don't let the crowd discourage you, LGO is worth the wait . Parking at LGO can be a challenge.  However, valet service is available.\\n\\nLGO has a hip vibe with a café/local maket feel. The staff at LGO are very accommodating in helping you find exactly what your looking for.  Give yourself some extra time to browse while at LGO, there are various trinkets and goodies.  You'll find so many interesting gifts and items for yourself or a friend.  \\n\\nOn this visit we started off with salads.  A Caesar and  a Caprese.  The salads were fresh, crispy,  and delicious. After our salads came the pie. We  ordered a cheese \\nand sausage, all I can say is the pie was  devoured.  The crust was very crispy and very thin. Just cheese, tomatoes, sausage, and fresh basil.  Pure, simple deliciousness. All our food came out fast and hot, except for the salads, which were cold and crisp.\\n\\nI also purchased a chocolate croissant, chocolate scone, and a bag of LGO's famous English muffins to go. LGO's English muffins are amazing, and are  everything an English muffin should be. LGO's English muffins are soft and toast up perfectly for buttering. I don't recall ever having had an equal.\\n\\nIf your ever in the area, you should stop by and give LGO a try, you won't be disappointed.\\nWings Done Right\\n\\nWing Stop, by far has some of the\\xa0best wings in the state. If you're a fan of wings, then you need to go to Wing Stop and pick up a dozen or maybe even two dozen right this second. \\n\\nThe wings at Wing Stop are 100% all white meat,  served to order piping hot.  Wing Stop offers a variety of flavors,  from Atomic to Teriyaki.  Th\\ne wings at Wing Stop are crispy, moist, and of descent size.  The Hawaiian, and Garlic Parmesan were delicious. The parmesan cheese added just the right finishing touch.  Wing Stop allows you to Mix and match your orders.  You can combine regular wings and boneless wings.  \\n \\nIn addition to wings, Wing Stop has some great side items to accompany your wings.  You have to try the homestyle fries which are cut fresh daily.  If fries aren't to your tasting then maybe the homemade potato salad, cole slaw, bourbon baked beans, or fresh baked rolls are.  The rolls are fresh, hot, and absolutely delicious. \\n\\nThe staff at Wing Stop are friendly and helpful.  There is limited seating so get there early. On this visit we got our wings to go.  If you call ahead your order will be ready for pick up when you arrive. If your craving wings give Wing Stop a try you will not be disappointed.\\nGood Sandwiches\\n\\nToday, I went to the 'NY Slicers Deli' for lunch.   NY Slicers offers a variety of great sandwic\\nhes, soups, and daily specials, at very reasonable prices.\\n\\nOn this visit I ordered the Triple Threat \\n(Ham, turkey, salami, mayo, oil, vinegar, lettuce and tomato) and my lunch companion had the grilled cheese. The sandwiches at NY Skicers are huge and very filling.  Our sandwiches were delicious, the grilled cheese was cooked just right and the bread on both sandwiches  was very fresh.\\n\\nThe staff at NY Slicers are very friendly, helpful, and accommating.  I \\nhighly recommended, NY Skicers if you like traditional deli sandwiches.\\nUK pub atmosphere in Phoenix\\n\\nI have never been to a pub in the UK.  Howerver, I have a image in my mind of what a pub in the UK might look like and George and Dragon made that image a reality.\\n\\nGeorge and Dragon is unpolished, and unpretentious.  The atmosphere is very relaxing and welcoming.  As I  sat muling over the menu I enjoyed listening to the random music being played.  In the short time I was at George and Dragon I  listened to  metal, George Michae\\nl, Aretha Franklin, classical and everything in between. \\n\\nThe customer service at George and Dragon in amazing.  The servers  were very accommodating without being intrusive. Our server took the time to explain the menu and even offered suggestions based on our preferences.\\n\\nMoving onto the food.  The food at George and Dragon is great and served piping hot (which I truly enjoy).  The unique combinations of flavors were prepared and presented perfectly.  My lunch party and I tried Bangers & Mash, Roasted Vegetable Pastie, fish& chip, Shepherd Pie, and Meatloaf. All of the entrées were delicious. \\n\\nEven though we were full from lunch because at George and Dragon the servings are large. We had to try dessert. So we ordered blackberry crumble and  bread pudding.  I have to say the bread pudding  was the best I have ever had.\\n\\nWe will definitely be making this place a regular stop.\\nAlways A Great Meal.\\n\\nI have been to Lone Star Steakhouse on Camelback on several occasions and have never b\", 'actual_label': 10, 'predicted_label': 10}, {'text': \"een disappointed.  Lone Star Steakhouse's has a casual and inviting atmosphere and is known for their outstanding customer service  and memorable meals.\\n\\nLone Star Steakhouse has so many delicious entrées to select from.  There are  steaks which are delicious and reasonably priced. The burgers are large and cooked to perfection and the ribs will melt in your mouth. If beef isnt for you, then you have to select a chicken entrée.  The sidewinder chicken sandwich is always  an excellent choice whether served as a sandwich or as an entree.  \\n\\n The entrees are well worth the price, at under $15 (depending on the entree).  The service is excellent and the staff is friendly and accomdating.  The manager's makes themselves  avaliable to their guest, as they walk around the dining area ensuring their guest are having a pleasant  dining experience.\\n\\nIf you find yourself in the area give Lone Star Steakhouse a try, you won't be disappointed.\\nBest Wine Selection \\n\\nI was going to a small dinner par\\nty with some friends and wanted to bring a nice Malbec and Cabernet Sauvignon to the dinner party.  So, a quick stop at Total Wine and More was in my future.\\n\\nTotal Wine and more is truly second to none, when shopping  for wine and spirts.  I planned  on making a quick trip however,  I stayed much longer then I anticipated. \\n\\nTotal Wine and More carries wines from every wine-producing region in the world and from every price range. It is easy to lose track of time as you walk down  the aisles admiring the selection .  In addition to wines I enjoy looking at the selection of beers that range from America's most popular to hard-to-find microbrews and imports. \\n\\nIt can be challenging at times to make a decision on what to purchase.   However, the staff at Total Wine and More are pleasant, accommodating, and very knowledgeable.  The staff will even offer suggestions, or direct you to your preferences. \\n\\nIf you haven't been to Total Wine and More, you should stop by.\\nNot for me\\n\\nI stopped b\\ny PT Noodles to grab a quick bite to eat. I ordered an eggroll and beef fried rice. The restaurant was crowded, not much room, not much verbal contact with owners or waitstaff. \\n\\nThe tables around us were left dirty which was a bit of a turn off.  PT Noodles is a small place so you're quite close to your neighbors.     \\n\\nOn this visit we had eggrolls and Beef Stir Fried Rice. The beef stir fried rice was tasteless. The strips of thin sliced beef was tough and overcooked. It seemed as if the beef was pre-cooked and then added to the rice, we left more then half on our plates.  As for the eggroll, it was just okay.  \\n\\nWas disappointed with the meal. I Wouldn't go back again.\\nAnnas Linens might not be top of the line high quality products but the merchandise is nice and the customer services is amazing.\\n\\n\\nAnna's Linens  has just about everything you can use in a house, at a low price, that wont brake your wallet and friends and family will walk in your house, and go wow!! were did you buy\\n that.\\n\\nI really like Annas Linens. I really do.\\xa0\\nKeep up the good job.\\nNot my usual stop.\\n\\nThis Starbucks is not my usual stop however, it just might be my favorite. I love my coffee and what's better then a Starbucks a iced white chocolate mocha, I can't think of anything.\\n\\nThe service at this Starbucks is phenomenal and the staff are always very friendly. This location is clean, inviting, and feels comfortable and they have seating outside at the patio, and wuth this cooler weather what a perfect option.\\n\\nMy coffee was made exactly the way I order and tasted great. In addition, to the great coffee Starbucks has delicious pastries if you need a snack. I really enjoy grabbing a cake pop or two to go.\\n\\nGreat coffee, pastries,  friendly staff, and shopping.  It doesn't get any better.\\nIf you like Italian Ice ... you should give Joe's a try.\\n\\n I am so glad a friend told me about Joes Italian Ice. These italian ices are very close to what you get in the city (I think the Italian Ices at J\\noe's might be better).\\n\\nI grew up in New York and have always enjoyed Italian Ices.  So, when I hear about italian ices in my area, its a pretty good bet I am going to stop and give it a try. \\n\\n\\nThe decor at Joe's  is like a old soda shop.  The servers are friendly and they offer samples of any flavor you want to taste. My nephew and I  sampled just about everything in the shop before we made our final choices.\\n\\nOn my first visit I went with the Bada Bing Black Cherry and my nephew had the vanilla custard.  My black cherry ice was so good.  I wouldn't have shared if I hadn't wanted to try my nephews vanilla custard.  The Italian ice was sweet, refreshing,  with bits of real fruit inside. It was absolutely delicious as was the vanilla custard. \\n\\nI will be sure to go back. There are so many flavors I can't wait to sample.\\nGlad it only comes around once a year\\n\\n\\nSpirit Halloween store has great animatronics and displays of gory scenes everywhere.

I take my nephew  there as its more of a haunted house operation.\\n\\nThe service and staff are okay but needless to say they didn\\'t go out of their way to give a lending hand.  Spirit Halloween serves its purpose however, I\\'m glad this store only comes around once a year.\\nI have to admit the folks over at Mattress Firm really know how to treat their customer\\'s right.  Recently, I purchased a mattress set and due to a computer glitch my mattress set was not delivered on time.  Juan my sales associate  was more than apologetic and went out of his way to make things right for me.  Not only did Juan refund my delivery cost  Juan also gave me a set of sheets, a perium mattress pad, and set of  memory foam pillows for my inconvenience.\\n\\nMattress Firm has just gained a customer for life. I\\'ll be sure to tell all my friends, family, and fellow \"yelpers\" the  same\\nNice choice for a quick meal \\n\\nPotbelly\\'s is\\n a small sandwich shop with a relaxing, neighborhood vibe.  Potbelly offers all the favorites, turkey, ham, meatball, italian mixed,by chicken and cheddar, tuna, chicken, and my favorite \"the wreck\".\\n\\nPotbelly also serves  chili, soups, shakes and smoothies.  Potbelly aslo serves  \"skinny\" sandwiches with less meat for those watching their calorie intake.\\n\\nThe staff is friendly and accommodating and will offer suggestions if you like. Potbelly\\'s is a nice choice for a quick meal.\\nGreat prices \\n\\nIt\\'s almost unfathomable that a company that barely, if at all, advertises for gasoline can be on the top of my favorite list, for offering the lowest prices on gas in town, but it has.\\n\\n Costco, knows how to generate customer loyalty with low prices, great customer service, and clean facilities. Sure, at times the lines for fuel can be long, but it\\'s worth the wait. I\\'ve used other fueling stations at times, however, I always find myself going back to Costco.\\nJust not for me\\n\\nI haven\\'t been to \\nCarlos O\\'Brien\\'s in quite some time, so I thought maybe I should stop in and grab a quick bite to eat. The restraunt wasn\\'t  busy so we were seated immediately and a large basket of chips and two kinds of salsa were promptly delivered to our table. I have had better salsa however, my lunch companion thought the salsa was good.\\n\\nI ordered the chicken fundido as did my lunch companion. In what seemed like an impossibly short time our orders were placed in front of us. I have to say that the entrees served at Carlos O\\'briens are of very generous portions.  In fact,  there was enough there for two to share.  You definitely get your money\\'s worth.  However, I really didn\\'t care for the taste of the chicken fundido.  The chicken was very dry and the sauce didn\\'t have much flavor. I guess this restraunt just isn\\'t for me.\\n\\nOn a positive note our server, was very attentive and wanted to make sure everything was to our liking. \\n\\n.\\nPretty Good\\n\\nWe were looking for a spot for a light lunch and Gr\\neen Mix fit the bill. My sister and I both enjoyed our salads. The ingredients are fresh, plentiful, and the selection is large enough for everyone to find something they would enjoy. Green Mix also serves panini and rice bowls.  I will have to give those a try on my next visit.\\n\\nThe staff are  friendly and engaging. The restaurant is clean and inviting. If you ever find yourself in the mood for a deliciously light lunch you have to try this place you won\\'t be disappointed.\\nDon\\'t Judge A Book By Its Cover\\n\\nKnock Kneed Lobster might not look like much from the outside but as the old adage goes,  \"Don\\'t judge a book by its cover\".  If you are searching for an upscale restaurant with only healthy seafood options, look somewhere else. However, if you want a great \"hole in the wall\" place where you can enjoy good, old time fish & chips, Knock Kneed Lobster is the place for you.\\n\\nKnock Kneed Lobster has been serving fish and chips for about 50 years, and there\\'s a reason why Knock Kneed Lobs\\nter has been in the business for so long, the food at Knock Kneed Lobster is really good.\\n\\nKnock Kneed Lobster  is a walkup to the window and wait to be called to pick up your order kind of place. Sure, the atmosphere might be nothing to write home about, and Knock kneed lobster couldn\\'t be considered an upscale restaurant, however, no one can deny that Knock Kneed Lobster is serving up delicious fish/shrimp & chips. \\n\\nToday, I ordered the 2-piece fish/shrimp and chips, and not only was my fish/shrimp cooked perfectly crisp and light but the serving was large.\\n.  \\nIn addition, to serving hot, fresh, delicious meals.  Knock Kneed Lobster makes sure you have everything you want to top your meal. The condiment bar has everything you could possoble want or need.  There\\'s  ranch dressing, tater sauce, cocktail sauce, malt vinger, and ketchup, just to name a few.\\n\\nThe staff is always friendly, service is fast, and prices are reasonable. Knock Kneed Lobster has always been a good old stand-by', 'actual_label': 10, 'predicted_label': 10}, {'text': ' the dish is so well seasoned and flavored by fresh basil and peppercorn and made extra spicy by using fresh Thai chili. I can eat this everyday!! \\n\\nThe taro filled spring roll and mango salad both delicious. \\n\\nFor dessert, my waiter recommended Water Chestnut in Coconut milk - Tab Tim Krob ($3.95). So colorful and the chestnut has a chewy tapioca outer layer and crunchy inside.  \\n\\nI will definitely be back again to Jatujak for some authentic Thai cooking and hospitality.. Definitely the best Thai food in the area!\\n\\nMake sure to your Yelp App to check in for a free Thai Iced Tea!\\nCheap Beers! $11.50 a pitcher everyday and anytime!\\n\\nGreat place for a meet up as it takes reservations even on a busy Saturday night! \\n\\nI have not try the food or other drinks, but All I NEED is BEER! :)\\n\\nInterior is quite dark. Though the lighting is not good for photographs but great if you are half drunk or drunk....\\n\\nI will be back for some cheap drinks.. Mill Street is A-OK!\\nWe dropped by Town Crier Pub \\nfor a quick drink before Blue Jays game yesterday. At 6:15 pm, the place was packed! There were though tables that were empty which were supposed to be \"reserved\".\\n\\nWe told the waitress we were here just for a quick drink and seemed like they don\\'t really have an open table for 3. We were squeezed into a table for 2...\\n\\nWe were here for 1 hour or so and all these time those tables were still empty....... \\n\\nThe Beer list is good if you are into imports! Still a good place to grab a quick drink or 2!\\nVisiting Museum of Inuit Art is quite a refreshing experience especially when the weather is hot and humid. \\n\\nThe cool and white and glossy surrounding gave me a feeling that I am in the Arctic.. icy, cold and the crisp smell of coldness... \\n\\nExhibitions has interesting sculptures and crafts and it is good way to learn about the Inuit History. \\n\\nFree Admission on certain days, at least on the day I was there! Great to browse around!!\\nI really enjoyed the pomegranate/mango juice ($2.50) I ord\\nered from Freshly Squeezed at Eaton Centre.\\n\\nThe selections of Real fruit juice are huge and interestingly exotic?... but I wish for more healthy less sugary options if available.\\n\\nThe servers here were nice and polite! Definitely I would advice no ice if you order one of their juice... You really don\\'t want to have 1/2 cup of ice in their smallish small size...\\n2.5 Star with rooms for improvement\\n\\nSince it is their first week in business, I can understand there are a lot of confusion both in the front and kitchen. Hopefully they would have that sorted out in the future.\\n\\nA better system of who and how to greet and seat your customers.\\n\\n- I came in on a Saturday when the restaurant was half full, I was standing in the entry trying to get someone attention but I felt like all the staff just stayed at the back area and tried not to have any eye contact with me\\n\\n- I do understand Midland and Finch has a high concentration of Mandarin speakers but unfortunately I am not one of them. Please\\n kindly make sure that your customers understand and able to communicate. \\n\\n- Try to keep an eye on the dining area at all time. It was a frustrating experience trying to get attention from the servers even there were plentiful\\n\\nFood Quality and Quantity\\n\\n- Durian Mochi ($4.99) though small in portion but actually really good. It has a nice thin chewy wrapping and filled with durian meat\\n\\n- Milk Pudding with Red Bean ($5.99) served room temperature warm. Maybe the menu should have said it is served cold or should it be hot? The red beans though is good quality, but for $6 I do expect a little more?\\n\\n- Mini spoons as utensils might help to make the dessert looks like bigger in portion? I can\\'t imagine if someone has big hands and how they can use those playhouse spoons\\n\\nSoft opening special 20% off was nice touch but I cannot really justify paying full price here aside from the mochi.\\nI always IN for sweet and staying out late on a Saturday night! \\n\\nAfter having Japanese sushi, we looki\\nng for a place for a night Cap and my date suggested going to Sicilian Sidewalk Cafe for some crepes! She really knows how I roll! \\n\\nSicilian Sidewalk Cafe is not one of those girly Cafe... Nothing Girly with Leaf\\'s Game showing on TV (aside from the Leaf\\'s being girly and they suck big time..?? that\\'s a different story!) \\n\\nFreshly made Crepes/Waffles seems to be the most popular thing on the menu... So we decided to share a ice cream crepes... that was so yummy... but the tiramisu was one of the worst  and the driest one I ever have! \\n\\nSKIP the cake!! Order anything else but that!!\\n\\nI have to give credit for Sicilian Sidewalk Cafe to stay open till 3 AM on Friday and Saturday night... What\\'s better to have one of those crepes after a whole night of drinking?\\nI been to a few Teaopia in the area.. and this location at Shops at Don Mills is the one that I like the best!\\n\\nWhy so? Are they all the same since they are all franchise?\\n\\nThis is the only location I been to that has almost all t', 'actual_label': 11, 'predicted_label': 11}, {'text': 'he loose tea leaves samples on a round rack for me to closely examine the mix, smell it and play with it! :) Sometimes I don\\'t really want to bother the staff here when there were only 1 selling and 1 mixing drinks and there was a line waiting for services!\\n\\nLove the seatings there and the area dedicated to selling brewed tea and tea latte. At the other locations, that was like an afterthought but here seems the emphasis are more on the tea cafe drinking  then just selling their products.\\n\\nThis is a great place to meet up with your friends or just chill if you are more a tea drinking person VS coffee drinking person.. since there are floor to ceilings windows overlooking the main area at Shops at Don Mills.. good place to people watch during summer!\\nI would not have rent a car from Enterprise. My insurance company set me up with them while my car was in the shop to have one of the window fix. \\n\\nServices here was A-OK. In and out with rental with minimum stress. and not like I have not \\nbeen stressed enough, \\n\\nThe rental car though was in bad shape. I doubt the interior has been cleaned ever!! It was so smelly, dirty, dusty.. and just filthy. I know it is just a rental for a couple of days, but still. \\n\\nNot only the interior is filthy, I definitely think it has some mechanic problem as the front side of the vehicle kept making funny noises when I making turns... I didn\\'t even feel safe enough to drive it on the highways. \\n\\nI am so so glad to have my own car back!!\\nThe Comrade is my favourite lounge in Leslieville!\\n\\nGreat beer selections with 2 full pages, for sure you can find something you like!\\n\\nCocktails from $10 were nicely crafted. My Elderflower Frizz ($10) was well balanced.\\n\\nStaffs were attentive and not being overbearing. \\n\\nI love the different seating options. The armchairs we  lounge in feels homey and comfy...... \\n\\nCheers!\\nI have never been to The Good Son\\'s original Queen Street West location and this is the first time I have a taste of what they offers a\\nt this Assembly Chef\\'s Hall.\\n\\nWe shared \\n\\nSpicy Sopressata ($18) ~ Anaheim Chili, Sun Dried Olives\\n\\nAs the pizza is hand-tossed and made-to-order, it did take 10-15 minute for our pizza to be ready even when the place was not too busy. Make sure you are not in a rush to get back to work.\\n\\nPizza has a nice thin charred crust. A little bit of spiciness from chili and a little bit of savory from olives.\\n\\nPerfect for sharing. Or of course you can eat that pie and called it a happy meal.\\n\\nSelection here though limited to pizza but I hope there will be some other options in the future.\\nShooting photos of Black Balls, White Balls, trying to get the best angle... and talking about Buns... bending over... (Am I  at a Dirty Chinese Place talking Dirty?)\\n\\nToo bad no (chicken) feet sucking (as our guest of honour is not into that!)... or something more kinky... as the menu here at Regal Palace is quite basic and limit in selections..\\n\\nHow can one even think the above words can be used during a tra\\nditional dim sum restaurant that has 20%off Senior Specials!!\\n\\nEdwin A even forgot what\\'s he ate... or taste.. since we never have the Siu Mai..... \\n\\nI wish the food were served more steaming hot, service can be more attentive and the watered down tea ($1.20/person) could be stronger.\\n\\nThe dim sums were ok.. but I definitely have better ones... and now some will argue because since those are \"healthier\" version.. and they will never be as good as the \"REAL\" ones!\\n\\nRegal Palace is a nice and quiet place for dim sum lunch as long as you don\\'t mind paying the price..... no discount for us yet since we are still a few years before we consider as Seniors....\\nI always try to fill up at this particular Esso location when I am in the neighbourhood.\\n\\nGas prices here is always a few cents cheaper than all the other stations in the area.\\n\\nSince it is not near any major highway, there is seldom any line up for gas.\\n\\nThe only complaint maybe it is impossible to get into the station if you are drivi\\nng East on Major Mackenize or North on Dufferin. \\n\\nAlways good to get cheaper fuel nowadays with this high prices on gas!\\nPapa Chang\\'s Express located inside Pacific Mall is good to get some Taiwanese snacks and comfort food.\\n\\nTucked in the 2nd floor in the middle of all these alleys and stalls. Just walk around, you will find it eventually. \\n\\nMinced Pork with Sausage ($3.49) and Popcorn Chicken ($4.99) were both ok. Not gourmet food but more like street food for a quick snack. The use of dark meat for the popcorn chicken did make the pieces more moist but I highly recommend sharing that, as the taste did get a little boring after a few pieces.\\n\\nPlace your order and walk around for 10 to 15 minute and your order will be ready.\\nKonner Chinese Restaurant is located at a brand new plaza at Midland and Finch, right in between Scarborough Villa and Finch Midland Centre.\\n\\nThe plaza is practically empty, with no stores!! You will have no problem finding parking at all! :)\\n\\nThe restaurant is n', 'actual_label': 11, 'predicted_label': 11}, {'text': \"ice and clean since it is only a few week old?

But you can alter less or more by requesting!\\n\\nWe ordered the Dan Dan Noodles ($2.99), Fern Root Noodles($6.99) and Smelly Tofu($8.99) which are all spicy.\\n\\nDan Dan Noodles comes in a small bowl with the right touch of spiciness and a little bit of sauce. Since it is a cold dish, I found it quite refreshing! \\n\\nFern Root Noodles.. looks not too good in presentation! hmmmm dark gray noodles all mixed up with hot sauce, pepper, garlic, vinegar. It is not too spicy but the taste is quite complex and interesting!\\n\\nThe Smelly Tofu, ok it is served on a sizzling pan... the tofu are black in colour.. black coloured tofu! Yes it is quite smelly... and you will have to get use to the taste. Either you like you or you cannot stand it!. The sauce is spicy too an\\nd cover in green pepper.. I would not say I loved it.. but it is really an acquired taste!\\n\\nThere are so many interesting items on the menu.. something you cannot get in other Northern Chinese Restaurant. e.g Deep Fried Pig Blood Balls! Some of the Chinese names I could not even pronunce.\\n\\nI would definitely come back to try some of them out! Especially those with 3 chilli!!\\n\\nThey do have lunch specials for $4.99 that comes with a soup or soy milk drink.\\n\\nThey accepts Visa or Mastercard with bills of $30 or more! So if you want to use your credit card, be prepare to eat more!\\nDimmi Bar & Trattoria was busy even on a weekday afternoon. We got stuck at a table near the kitchen so I total feel that the place was buzzing with actions...\\n\\nStandard Italian restaurant menu so everyone would definitely find something that they enjoy.... \\n\\n3 of us ended up sharing:\\n\\nBaby Spinach and Walnut Salad ($14.95)  in a honey balsamic vinaigrette with roasted walnuts, blue cheese, and candied fruit was d\\nelightful. It is hard to believe but this was the best part of my lunch.\\n\\nFettucine Alla Riviera ($19.95) With shrimps, scallops, mussels, clams and calamari with a really really light tomato sauce... a little too light maybe? Portion is really small...definitely not good for sharing! I can eat 2 of those.....\\n\\nDiavola ($14.95) Pizza with tomato sauce, mozzarella and spicy homemade Italian sausage... My Yelp friend who is a spice lover was draw to that when he said SPICY!... but definitely that's not too much heat but plenty of sodium.... now I am a feeling that I am going to stick with veggie or plain options for pizza toppings from now on...\\n\\nService is lukewarm and rush as the staffs were busy serving the lunch crowds....\\n\\nI think I would give Dimmi a pass... I probably won't be coming back for their cooking, but if you are in Yorkville, you probably can give the place a try!\\nYorkdale Subway Station is another subway station I frequent when I'm using TTC. \\n\\nFree Parking after 9:30 A\\nM on weekdays and Free weekends and holidays is the main reason I been coming back. Covered parking area which is designated especially for TTC commuters. Of course able to shop at Yorkdale before or after is always an added incentives? \\n\\nThe platform is above ground , so you really need to bundle up while you waiting for your train arrive during winter, it can be bitter cold!\\nThe verdict for the chicken lamprais from Abbirami Catering: Spicy!! \\n\\nAfter sharing that huge lamprais for lunch with 2 other yelpers... I am satisfied and happy.. eating spicy food makes my tummy feels nice and burning warm. \\n\\nSo much different flavours in this little bundle of joy, I saw my friend eager tasted different colourful portion of lamprais and guessing what they were and enjoying the different sensation of spiciness. \\n\\nIf you are like me, enjoy spicy and intensive flavours that will knock your socks off.. you will love that!! \\n\\nThanks for my nice friend got this yummy lunch for us as a takeout...!\\nWh\\nen I think about First Markham Place, I think about Food Food Food and more food!! It is like a giant Food Court, anything Asian you can find it here!\\n\\nMost of the restaurants here are reasonably priced and being in such a competitive environment, all of them have to be excellent and good value if not they won't be in business for long...... the turnover of business here is so fast and frequent!!\\n\\nParking can be a hassle on weekend, but this is nothing when compare to Pacific Mall!! I love to come here whenever I have no idea what I am going to have for lunch, and I always find something to eat!!!\\nI am going to rate Very Fair Seafood Restaurant based on the banquet experience I had this weekend. \\n\\nI do have high expectation with the banquet since it cost $800 that includes taxes and tips. $80 per head, that sounded like a good meal. \\n\\nThe night we were there for the banquet, the whole restaurant was fully booked with 3 different celebrations. I think because the restaurant was so busy,\", 'actual_label': 11, 'predicted_label': 11}, {'text': \" they really over extended their staffs! It really affect the services. \\n\\nThe food was quite good, especially the Deep Fried Stuffed Crab Claws and the Shark Fin Soup. The crab claws were nice and big hardly with any fillings and the shark fin soup was nice with tons of shark fins inside (sorry poor sharks..) \\n\\nAside from that the other dishes were just OK. The steamed fishes I will say is the worse of them all. They did not taste too fresh and they over steamed them. The lobsters were pretty small, we just have 3 little pieces each. \\n\\nI have to say our waitress did over work!! She alone has to serve 3 tables!! That included bringing the dishes out, have it distributed on individual plates for each guests. The way she was dumping the dish on our table and throwing the food quickly on the individual dishes... She insisted us to help her clean the table by putting our used dishes out and piled them up for her. \\n\\nThe beers were just all left on our table. They were lure warm!! We asked if\\n she can get us some cold one... She was so reluctant.. saying she is really busy...... even after she got us the beers later, they were not cold at all, but at least not warm. \\n\\nWith the price they are charging for the banquet, maybe I have a high expectation and of course I was disappointed.\\nMy Airbnb for My Weekend in Montreal was just 5 minute away, so I decided to come to Lapin Presse for a coffee.\\n\\nLove the interior and their logo: Rabbit (I do love bunny theme anything)\\n\\nMacchiato was A-OK. I still find most espresso based coffee in Montreal more on the sour side. \\n\\nGreat little cafe to chill out in the Neighbourhood.\\nCoffee Shop during the day and Restaurant in the evening.\\n\\nDropped by Cafe Sardine for a hangover coffee.... The lighting is perfect as it was dark and dim.\\n\\nDonuts I found them decent, didn't wow me.\\n\\nCappuccino was fine..  but I had better.\\n\\nCafe Sardine was A-OK.. but doesn't really worth a special trip just to come for their coffee and donuts... but the evening\\n experience might be totally different!\\n\\nSadly Cafe Sardine had closed the week after I visit...\\nYuzu Izakaya opens till 3 am.. Seriously? \\n\\nGreat for late night snack and drinks!! \\n\\nThis place so new I can even smell the fresh paint... \\n\\nSkewers $3 for 2 not a bad deal..... We tried the Pork Neck and Beef. Pork neck is well flavored, great bite and really porky. Love the hot peppers! \\n\\nWara-Yaki Beef Tongue ($10) was meh for me unless you love the charcoalness.. The texture was way too mushy for my liking. I feel like I just smoked a cigar after eating that!\\n\\nBeer selection is so so Coors Light? Meh\\nLack of Seats!\\n\\nLong lines for drinks!\\n\\nI would not go to this Starbucks as there are other options in the area. This parking lot is just crazy, the driveways and the lanes between rolls of cars are so narrow, a lot of crazy drivers and a lot of senior drivers... all these make parking or driving in the parking lot extra dangerous!\\n\\nI will pass!!\\nI smell almost Every single tea at Majestea\\ns tea and have fun doing that! :)\\n\\nFriendly staffs and storeowner! Just love little establishment like Majesteas. \\n\\nThe tea selections really from around the World: China, Japan, India and more... of course there are herbal tea available too....\\n\\nI also sample the Tea of the Day which is an Irish Blend... strong and dark with a malty flavour... but I settled for a Asaam White instead.\\n\\nThey have this Loyaltea program which is good if you are a regulars!\\n\\nMajesteas for sure is a great tea shop, drop by next time when you are in the area...and smell some tea!! :)\\nThis review is based on Dim Sum experience at Full House Chinese Cuisine.\\n\\n$2.08 each for all the dim sum items on the ordering sheet all day!!! Great value!\\n\\nThe wait staffs though were really indifference.... one of those that pretend they don't see you and most of them just group themselves chatting away at the back of the restaurant.\\n\\nThe dim sums though were meh. The Chicken with Sticky Rice wrapped in lotus leaf was not ev\\nen heated all the way through. \\n\\nI definitely not recommend coming to Full House if you want a decent dim sum experience!\\nNCIX has opened up a few retail stores in GTA. It is really a web-based computer hardware retailers that concentrated their sales and effort in Greater Vancouver Area but now they are trying for the GTA market.\\n\\nThe website is really helpful and informative... it is great to do all the research online, do price comparison and then now you can in fact go into a store and talk to someone face to face if you have questions.\\n\\nDropped by the store on a cold winter night and they do have notebook, desktop and accessories on display... price seems to be inline with other stores...\\n\\nThe reason I giving NCIX a 3 star is because the sale associates here were super nice... even I look like someone not going to buy anything or not even know what I am looking for... he came over and gave me a desktop calender. I know it does not worth much... but it is really the thoughts that c\", 'actual_label': 11, 'predicted_label': 11}, {'text': 'ount??!\\n\\nNow at least I have a good impression of the business and if I am looking for something... NCIX will be one of the business I will consider!\\nChez ma grosse truie cherie was not really on my list of must try Montreal\\'s restaurants. I ended up here because with a group on 5, it was not easy to get a reservation on a busy Saturday night. This restaurant seems to catered to large groups with communal tables and family style menu, which seems to be well suited our party of five.\\n\\nService was attentive and excellent. I wish the food can match the service. \\n\\nWe shared: \\n\\nOysters ($15) - Apple ice cider vinegar from Vergers de la Colline\\n- Not bad, I had better oysters..\\n\\nChef Choice Seared Foie Gras ($23)\\n- The best part of the meal... I would just come back to have that\\n- Love how the sourness of the fresh grapes compliment the fattiness of the foie gras\\n- No sharing! All mine!\\n\\nThe Whole Hog ($32/pp) - Baby back ribs, smoked grilled pork chop, braised shanks, braising juices and pa\\nrmesan cheese French fries \\n- The platter looked amazing for photos but most of the meat tasted bland and dry\\n- The only thing I enjoyed was the shank which was tender and moist\\n- I did enjoy the roasted vegetables... \\n\\nThe only saving grace might be some local beers in bottles... Dieu du Ciel did make the dining experience a little more enjoyable.\\n\\nSadly I doubt I will be coming back again really soon...... unless I can have that foie gras all for myself!\\nI like how Fresh Burger is keeping everything simple and try to do one thing really well..\\n\\nBurger!\\n\\nI love how my freshly grind daily in store from AAA Sirloin burger was cooked perfectly. Cooked through with no pink but still juicy and moist inside. The bun was nothing fancy, but the toppings were all fresh and I can tell that my burger was cooked to order with care!\\n\\n$7.99 combo includes Hamburger with Cheese, Fries and Pop, which is really reasonable. \\n\\nThe fries though was freshly cut but was a little over cooked. \\n\\nGive Fresh B\\nurger a try if you are in the area. A small owner/chef burger joint that still passionate about the food they serves!\\nFinally a brand new theatre in Markham area! \\n\\nThe signage definitely really confusing but I was there in the early afternoon checking out the place and able to ask Security where the underground parking located and the construction workers also directed me to the entrance of the theatre.\\n\\nVIP experience is excellent! The lounge area even has a patio that overlooks Downtown Markham (A lot of constructions still be the view will be great once everything is done in the area!) The drink/food menu is a little different here compares to one inside the theatre itself as the lounge menu is more extensive. \\n\\nOur server inside the theatre was able to get us the items that is \"not\" on the menu for \"seat\" service. But it was not too busy on a Wednesday night. Our food arrived around 10 minute after we put in our order.\\n\\nI highly recommended getting VIP experience if you are a drin\\nker. It was definitely fun drinking a cocktails/beers/wine while watching a movie! Drink prices is really reasonable with a cocktail 1oz for around $7.50 and up. I also like how they are served in real glass wares! The seats are super comfy! \\n\\nCalamari ($10) was so tender and fresh! Highly recommended though the portion is small. Burger with Jalapeno ($14) upgraded our side to a Poutine ($2) was delicious. Maybe I expected the worse and all the food item exceeded my expectation. Tropical Sangria ($7.50) was also nicely made!\\n\\nWill I be back for VIP experience? A big YES. But only if I able to arrive at least 30 minute early at least to enjoy the seat service and order an adult beverage. And if I using my SCENE point to redeem my complimentary tickets, FOR SURE!\\n\\nI just wish this location going to have some earlier shows on weekdays especially Tuesdays as I would love to beat the crowds instead just coming here to watch movie after 6:30 pm.\\nEvergreen Garden Market opens year round for o\\nur shopping pleasure.\\n\\nI do enjoy what they carries which consist local produce and products from independent supplier or farms in the area: honey, coffee, tea, baked goods, olive oil and much much more.\\n\\nThere are also a kid/toddler section at the back that have some nice handicraft and toys, great for gifting!\\n\\nDefinitely will be back during the gardening season to learn more about how to have a true green garden and more about different aspect of gardening!\\nThe opening of Kashmiri BBQ does make the food court of First Markham Place more diversified!\\n\\nLamb with Rice? It is kind of like a fried rice? It has a good seasoning of cumin and chucks of lamb pieces.\\n\\nLocating inside FMP competing against so many other fast food option is not going to be easy. If Kashmiri BBQ wants to attract more customers, they really needs to be more aggressive price and quality wise. But serving Halal food might give them an edge over the other food stalls inside FMP.\\nPastel Creperie & Dessert House is a ', 'actual_label': 11, 'predicted_label': 11}, {'text': 'clean, bright and upbeat dessert place. \\n\\nRed Bean and Sponge Cake Crepes with Green Tea Ice cream with $1 for a cup of coffee\\n \\nI love Crepes.. but Pastel Creperie\\'s Crepes is more like Crepes with an Asian twist.. Fusion Crepes?? I just don\\'t understand why there is whipped cream everywhere.. the one on the side I can just push it away but the whole crepe is filled with whipped cream.. \\n\\nAside from the whipped cream.. the red beans and the green tea ice cream tasted A-OK! I was so stuffed after consuming all the whipped cream and 2 huge scoop of ice cream!!\\n\\nWish the coffee has refills... really need more coffee to wash down the dessert.\\n\\nThe services here was polite and attentive. Nice Korean waitress with nice smiles...\\n\\nPastel Creperie is a nice little dessert place to take your date here for a nice dessert and a coffee.\\nI would not have take my dog to Veterinary Emergency Clinic if he is not suffering in the middle of the night. One can imagine the cost with be a lot more than yo\\nur regular vet.\\n\\nUnfortunately, he has IVDD which is specific to his breed and VEC does have neurologists on staff that able to operate on him within 24 hours of his ruptured disc. The alternative is to drive to University of Guelph in the middle of the night.\\n\\nIt is not cheap. Over $5000 but fortunately I do have insurance that cover 80% of the cost. This make it so much bearable. But it is still a shock to see the estimate and of course the final bill! And I do need to pay everything upfront!\\n\\nI found all the staffs here are really professional. My dog was admitted and diagnosed within 15 minute of our arrival and sedative was given so he can be more comfortable. He was taken care through the night and able to see a neurologist and have a MRI and operation the next day. The staffs always keep me up to date with the progress. \\n\\nI would definitely recommend going to VEC in case if your beloved pet got really sick when your regular vet is not available. \\n\\nI am glad that this service is \\navailable for us pet owners to utilize!!\\n\\nThey accepts all credit cards, even Diners!\\n\\nEven sadly my dog did passed away.\\nI love Banana Republic! \\n\\nBut I hate Banana Republic Factory Store!\\n\\nI know I know, since I am shopping at a Factory Store, I shouldn\\'t expect to have the most up to date stylish clothing.... \\n\\nBut the store is always so messy and not organized.\\n\\nI rather wait for a sale at the regular store than coming to stop at the Factory Store.\\nI don\\'t know if I am too young or too old when I was browsing around Anthropologie. \\n\\nMaybe I am really out of it! But gee I don\\'t really find anything that I want to try on remotely... and I did not even look at their prices. Personally I find that the clothings looks much better on their website in the photos than when I actually see the real thing! \\n\\nThe housewares sections are interesting as they have nice things for the kitchen maybe some of my friends would have like some of those for house warming gift.\\n3.5 Star\\n\\nMaru & Maru Sake \\nBar is a brand new restaurant that just opened along Yonge Street. When my friend walked by the other day after lunch, we not even sure they are open for business yet as no business hours is posted, but I decided to drop by on a Saturday early evening to check it out.\\n\\nBingo! The \"OPEN\" is ON! I am IN! Walking into a dark empty restaurant is a little intimating as I stood in the front with not a human being in sight.. Too early for some sake? Anybody Home??\\n\\nFriendly waitress seated me at the table while I looked over the menu. Good selection of bottled Sake with some draft and beer selection. Cocktail though surprising limited..maybe since it is still Maru\\'s Soft Opening. A temporary menu with some tapas and bar grab Japanese/Korean/Fusion Style and new permanent menu will be available soon.\\n\\nComplimentary Spicy Tuna Sashimi with Chips was offered as snack. Free and Tasty!!! I love it!\\n\\nSpicy Tuna Taco ($12) is nicely plated. Filling a little sparse(arugula, baby sprout, extra virgin \\nolive oil,siracha mayo).. great as a snack. \\n\\nI guess I have to come back with my other Yelp friends to sample more food and try some Soju cocktail and even sharing a bottle of Sake or 2?? \\n\\n* Weekday specials that includes $1 for 3 pc of Salmon Sashimi?!! I think I definitely will be back!\\n2.5 stars \\n\\nI don\\'t think I am ready to be a Chinese Royalty or Chinese Empress as yet. As I read this article that was framed on the wall in this small 2 table restaurant about these Royal cuisine. (http://www.thestar.com/living/article/551141) \\n\\nThe prices here are so reasonable! \\n\\nThe Herbal Beef Noodle ($4.99) has really tender and melt in your mouth beef brisket and the noodle though is store bought has a nice chewy bite to it. There is this really strong herbal/medicine taste in the beef.. probably those are slow cook in the strong herbal broth. However, the soup based is so oily and salty! There is this oil layer formed on top of the soup after we finished eating that.. (How can something tha', 'actual_label': 11, 'predicted_label': 11}, {'text': \"t is good for you be so salty and oily??) \\n\\nThe Royal Herbal Chicken with rice ($4.99) is huge too. It has half of the chicken. The chicken is the smaller version, think spring chicken. The chicken does taste ok. Though the white meat is a little tough since it was supposed to be deep fried in vegetable oil first then simmered in the 28 different ingredients for 1 hour. There is plentiful of rice at least 2 bowls and the sauce that the chicken was cooked in give the rice a little bit of the herbal taste. \\n\\nBTW, in order for these Royal Medical cuisine to regulate your body and cure it in anyway, you will have to be eating these at least once a week for months..... hmmm I don't know if I can handle that!! \\n\\nOur server, cashier and the cook is really nice and friendly. An excellent place to practice your Mandarin!! \\n\\nThey accepts Cash only!\\nDelta Hotels by Marriott Toronto is conveniently located in downtown Toronto and in walking distance to most tourist area.\\n\\nAnd since it is so close \\nto Union Station, you can hop on the Subway, UP Express, VIA Train, Go Transit and all these would connect you to anywhere around the City proper and the rest of GTA and beyond!\\n\\nThe hotel itself is relatively new and well maintained! My room is spacious and well appointed. And the view probably one of the best in the area with CN Tower and Lake Ontario. \\n\\nSoco Restaurant the main hotel restaurant has a great menu and good food. I don't really expect much from a hotel restaurant but it exceeded my expectation and the price is really reasonable too!\\n\\nSadly Char No 5 was not open during my last visit.

An independent Coffee/Espresso Cafe in this area..\\n. It is definitely a rare find...\\n\\nFamily owned and run with in house baked savoury pies and pastries. And of course espresso drinks! \\n\\nMy Americano ($1.90) though a little light for my taste. \\n\\nI do love the set up of the space.

Then out of the corner of my eyes I saw some Korean words, and Sinchon Food is tucked in at a corner inside the strip Mall. \\n\\nAll the Sinchon Food's waitresses kept speaking Korean to me then finally realized all I understand were welcome and thank you and good bye and you are cute.... \\n\\nWaitress: First Time? \\nMe: Yes \\nWaitress: Menu on the table layer.. what do you want? Lunch Special? \\nMe:\\n (Confused) Can I have a minute? \\n\\nEnded up Sinchon Food has one speciality... everyone order the same thing, especially when the weather is chilly... \\n\\nSul Lung Tang - Beef Bone Soup ($7.95) a milky, cloudy soup with wheat flour noodles serves with rice. You can order either with brisket, tongue, tripes, knee caps, tail.. this really reminds me of Vietnamese Pho :) \\n\\nThe Soup is served unseasoned as one can use the sea salt and pepper on the table to season according to your own preferences. If you like it spicy, the waitress can get you the red chili paste... I saw the older couple asked for it in Korean. Beef Bone Soup supposed to have simmered for over 12 hours and have this comforting effect and give Korean the I am at home vibe.... \\n\\nOnly a few piece of beef brisket in my soup, but I think the star supposed to be the soup... yes it was really tummy warming and especially you are a soup person!! \\n\\nFor Dinner, Sinchon Food serves more family style like in a big hot pot starting fro\\nm $27.. I guess no one should be eating dinner by themselves and it is all about sharing food with families and friends over some soju!\\n\\nSinchon Food is really a Korean franchise with world wide location!\\nGrey Goat Pub & Grill is Newmarket's oldest pub! \\n\\nThough it is the oldest pub the interior sure is amazing new and chic.

Not driving people nuts! \\n\\nHazelnuts, Almond, Pistachios, Walnut, Cashew just to name a few. \\n\\nI love at how you able to get all that in their good selections of Mixed Nuts version or as standalone.. no cheap peanuts in the mix at all! \\n\\nRoasted and Unsalted or Roasted and Salted more decisions to make. \\n\\nThe quality of the nuts and other products that Tavazo carries are all high gr\\naded.. all the nuts are big.. and fresh. \\n\\nThere are also some Turkish treats.. I ended up cannot resist and buying a couple to go with my coffee! I love how you can just buy 1 or 2 instead of a whole package! \\n\\nTavazo Dried Nuts & Fruits up at Richmond Hill is a newer, bigger and better version of their original location down at Thornhill. Really worth your visit. \\n\\nOh BTW nuts though unsalted nuts are healthier version of snacking..but it is not calories free... I have to cut myself off now since I just ate more than a handful while writing this review!\\nDon Mills Subway Station is my default station whenever I go downtown for my Yelp adventure.\\n\\nI know it is a hassle to change train to Yonge Subway line at Yonge and Sheppard. But free parking from 9:30 AM is a no brainer for me if I need to go downtown for lunch... Finch Station though more convenient but free parking is not until after 3 pm! \\n\\nOf course, Don Mills has covered parking, this is good for both summer and winter as my ca\\nr would never be boiling hot or covered in a blanket of snow.\\n\\nBeing right next to Fairview Mall also really convenient if you want to do some shopping or just get a coffee or a quick bite!\\nBagel Plus is the one of the most sanitary bakery I been in the area. \\n\\nAll the bagels are inside a glass cabinet, all neatly labelled. You can see exactly what they have for the day but if you want to buy any, the staff have to pack that for you.\\n\\nThe trade off is you cannot really cross examine what you are getting. Especially the sweet and pastries they are all kind of hidden behind some waxed paper.\\n\\nMost of the baked sweets are sold by weight... and they do have brownies and butter tarts too!\\n\\nMore than half of the store space is dedicated to a sit down cafe. You can get bagels in all style, eggs in different style and salad and other light meals.\\nYogi Noodle Delight (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/yogi-noodle-scarborough) opens up another location up in Richmond Hill.\\n\\nThe menu are identical for both \\nrestaurants.

But you will have to listen to waitresses chatting and gossiping to each other on top of their voices... doesn't it feels like home?\\n\\nCash only!\\nSuper Zamani is located right next to Super Khorak.. what a difference in the vibes. \\n\\nThe inside is quite small...the sel\\nections seems minimum. Even the hot food section looks so runned down and unattractive. The funny thing is the price point is a little higher than Super Khorak...so not surprise there was hardly any people shopping here.\\n\\nSo if you need to pick up any Persian groceries save yourself time and money.. go next door! That's what we did!\\nI just could not resist the 2 magic words: Lunch Special!\\n\\nThis time round Win's Seafood Restaurant did a good job and I know I will be back again.\\n\\nHomemade Fish Ball in Shark Bone Noodle Soup/Crispy Fish Skin and Hong Kong Style Milk Tea .. all these for $4.99!!!!!

I was glad that I made a reservation because when we arrived at 8 pm all the tables was occupied. So make sure you make a res\\nervation if you decide to dine here!\\n\\nThe interior was nicely decorated with vibrate colours. We were thinking about the $25 prix menu specials which they advertise on their website that includes salad/pasta/dessert. To our mismay we were informed that it is not available for March since they are doing the Stop For Food prix menu ($50 with $10 towards charity). My dining mates were little disappointed.... A lesson learned, don't believe the information on the outdated website, call to confirm!\\n\\nAnyway, I settled on the Stop for Food prix menu and we ordered a main course each: troccoli al nero ai frutti di mare, gallinella al mattone. \\n\\nThe Stop for Food prix menu is a 4 course menu which a number of choices which I decided on pear appetitizer, mussels on bread, lamb skewer and chocolate cake dessert.\\n\\nThe soup of the day ($9) is a mussel with beans soup.

I enjoyed the moist, filling meat of course along with the fresh vegetables and grilled onions, but to my taste nodules, the climax of the sandwich was the cottony pita bread corset that barely held it all in. Its flavor was coal-caressed, and its texture was contradictory; how could something so soft be sturdy enough to carry all of that meat? Eating the pita alone would have you think it was too delicate for sandwiches, and it is unquestionably pleasant enough to consume naked. Hummus wouldn\\'t even be required. \\n\\nMy only grouse with the gyro was that the tzatziki sauce was almost invisible to my radar if you follow me. It was just a white sauce that was just...there. Perhaps some more dill, cucumber, salt, or \\nother herbs could jolt it from the doldrums. Despite that, this was a lauable and muscular gyro.  \\n\\nOur sides were dolmades and yes, tater tots. I know, tater tots are part of an ironic, comfort food/ childish throwback movement now, but I like them simply because they\\'re a diversion from french fries, which I often tire of, and when done well, they can be quite flavory as well as offer a compromise between the light crunch of a frite and the heavy crunch of a potato chip. I couldn\\'t discern whether or not these were made from scratch, but they were crispy, salted, damn, damn good, and went famously with grand old Heinz 57 ketchup. \\n\\nThe oily, smooth grape leaves (dolmades) simply vanished in our mouths and were as fleeting as a fantasy.

We decided on Sienna Mercato due to its buzz, and an issue of Yelp Team-Up unfolded.\\n\\nAnd yes, Brian K. is a cool cat to loaf with. I enjoyed our meal-long conversation that traversed the subj\\nects of cuisine, music, comics, the state of Yelp, television, film, and life amidst the throngs of yuppie fellas in salmon-colored shorts, 50-something women who shop for clothes at Forever 21, and tanned, butt cleavage-bearing blondes in too-small jeans who stood in front of our booth in ten minutes intervals as I tried gallantly not to rubberneck. Alas...\\n\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsYNaUqo4cg\\n\\nWho knew that a meatball purveyor would be Pittsburgh\\'s newest brick-n-wood, old warehouse-lookin\\' pick-up joint? \\n\\nThe only things Brian and I picked up were some eats that I had a mixed reaction to also (look for his rant). This is particularly ironic considering our friendly dinner debate on star ratings.\\n\\n\"Hey, a \\'3\\' is decent,\" Brian said. \\n\\n\"Yeah, but to me it\\'s like gettin\\' a \\'C\\' on a test,\" I retorted.\\n\\nWith a modus operandi somewhat like that of Burgatory, SM allows patrons to choose between 5 different meatballs (Classic Beef, Spicy Pork, Vegetarian, Turkey, and a rotating \\'da\\nily ball\\'), along with a host of \"sauces and gravies\" in slider, panino, grinder, or breadless form. \\n\\nOne thing that I found puzzling when I first looked over the online menu was that tzatziki is offered as a sauce with no lamb meatball to be found. \\n\\nAnother caveat is that Sienna Mercato disallows diners to \"mix balls,\" meaning that their Meatball Grinder, which includes 3 balls per order, cannot be had with one Classic, one Turkey, and one Spicy Pork. Instead, they all have to be the same. As Rorschach of the Watchmen would respond, \"Hurm.\" \\n\\nBrian was conservative whereas I overdid it, but as I implied earlier, it gave us a chance to share and sample. \\n\\nI have to concur with his assessment of both the arancini and the poutine for the most part. The arancini came off like hush puppies in that only a hungry dog would be thrilled with them, the inexcusably drab truffle aioli adding nothing. The poutine was properly oozing with melted cheese curds, but the crisp, matchstick fries were \\nunseasoned, and the mushroom gravy fell flat. The only saving grace this dish had was the Classic Beef meatball that I included for an upcharge. Murderously moist and sinfully savory, I could detect some herb action happenin\\' in this \"secret\" recipe. The Spicy Pork and the Corned Beef meatballs, the latter being the aforementioned daily special, reared their somewhat appetizing heads in my grinder and in Brian\\'s panino. In fact, my only complaint about either was that they were both just a tad dry and would have probably benefited from the addition of some more egg and/or breadcrumbs. \\n\\nBrian\\'s panino came with sauerkraut between sheets of toasted bread and a pool of dijon mustard. The bisected spheres were beautiful, yet the smack of the mustard and the tartness of the sauerkraut made the sandwich cry out for a sweeter counterweight like Russian dressing. \\n\\nMy grinder came in a spongy, lightly baked roll with my choice of smoked gouda (other options include the more orthodox provolone\\n and oddly enough, American), which possessed a mild bitterness that I felt went well with the arribiatta, a spicy take on traditional marinara I handpicked from the menu.\\n\\nAlso requested was the Wedge salad, which  included iceberg lettuce, tomatoes, hard-boiled egg, bacon bits, shredded carrot, and croutons all neatly compartmentalized inside a metal bowl with a square cup containing French dressing. The portion of dressing was skimpy, tasting like a jumble of ketchup and sriracha sauce, which in and of itself wasn\\'t bad. I guess I just kept wishing I\\'d chosen ranch instead or eschewed a salad altogether. This was a ton of grub I\\'d attempted to consume...after we\\'d been discussing the tackiness of competitive eating no less. \\n\\nBut I ordered dessert too! Yes, I did. I went there. I avoided all of the other desserts since the bill of fare clearly states Turkey Hill ice cream is involved, and that isn\\'t a blight, really. It\\'s just that its a boring brand.

The brunch we had the other morning (Sat. the 5th) has carved the Dor-Stop\\'s reputation in stone with a white-hot bolt of starfire. \\n\\nThey were maddeningly busy when we walked in, but we were quickly seated a\\nnd we were immediately made to feel as if we were longtime regulars...or relatives. The service here is as friendly as it is on-the-ball and alone is enough to push Dor-Stop to 3 stars. \\n\\nThe 4th star comes from those pancakes. I ordered mine pumpkin-style. \\n\\nMy argument that pancakes are purely dessert has only been reinforced. It felt as if I was eating a stack of plate-sized, freshly-baked...cookies? I didn\\'t even drizzle syrup on them until I was halfway finished with them. That\\'s how sweetly saporous they were; no whipped cream or sprinkles needed. I wanted to pick them up, fold them over like sidewalk pizza cuts and eat them by hand. \\n\\nI...hungered like Galactus and needed another planet...err dish to consume, and I already had their burger the other day (for breakfast yet!) so I paid tribute to the fallen Big Mama\\'s House of Soul (check my review) and ordered the Steak & Cheese Hoagie...with egg! In comes the 5th star.\\n\\nIt was so good, I almost channeled James Brown and danced. \\n\\n\\nNo, this was a serious sandwich that was also fixed with tomato (diced!), lettuce, green peppers, sauteed onions and swiss cheese. Just when I started to think the steak was a little dry, it got better with each bite until I sadly bid farewell to the final morsel. Great, great bread also. I forgot to ask where they get it from, but I\\'m still thinkin\\' Kribel\\'s.\\n\\nThe ladyfriend ordered a prehistoric beast of a breakfast item called an  Eggs Burrito of which they offer several variations. Hers was made up of a, \"Soft flour tortilla filled with sausage, potatoes, scrambled eggs, cheddar cheese topped with border sauce, served with sour cream and shredded lettuce.\"\\n\\nAnd it was so massive she had to tag me in to save the day. \\n\\nTake all the \"breakfast burritos\" you\\'ve ever had to nuke or get from a fast-food joint, combine them, multiply by a factor of 5, and it\\'ll still get stomped on by a colossal three-toed foot in comparison.\\n\\nKay showed me that she knows how to eat, as she sliced it o\\npen to let the steam out and put the sour cream inside the gash. Alas it was too much for this damsel, so I gladly stepped in to finish off this\\n gooey, creamy, flavorsome dragon of a morning meal. \\n\\nSt. Guy of Fieri hyped the right place. My expectations were blown away with the force of a hurricane. Classic, classic, classic.\\nYes, we hit the other BnDz location! The one closest to us!\\n\\nOh, you didn\\'t think we\\'d let it slip by us, did you? No, no after this weekend we wouldn\\'t. \\n\\nBnDz\\'s red-and-black motif is still in effect here, although this is more the be-seated-and-be-waited-on experience. Unlike the South Park location, you can make your way through an undulating hallway to take a seat in the spacious dining room or grab a stool at the counter to watch all the sizzling, grill-side excitement for yourself as you indulge. \\n\\nFor those not yet hip to what\\'s goin\\' on, BnDz\\'s borrows from Burgatory their novel check-off sheet ordering system, allowing for premium customization. \\n\\nOnce\\n again, something was accidentally omitted. My burger -- this time the all-natural, hormone-free ground beef -- didn\\'t have the bacon I ordered, but once I called it to our server\\'s attention, she nixed it from the tab. Everything else I ticked off the boxes, however, was included. \\n\\nI went with the squishy Cellone\\'s white bun, their \"signature mayonnaise\" (I\\'m not sure what they put in it, but it\\'s a step above Hellmann\\'s for sure), avocado (forgotten at the South Park BnDz, ironically enough), grilled onions, honey mustard, sweet onion power, garlic powder, dill pickle chips, lettuce, tomato, and a marvelously melted American cheese. \\n\\nStill, I propose that some sort of scanner like those used to grade standardized tests could be applied here to \"read\" the menu sheets so as to offset human error.  It\\'s either that or have tableside touch screens. \\n\\nAnother minor gripe I have is that my medium-rare burger was almost medium. It was sort of hard to tell, but I kept feeling like there sh', 'actual_label': 12, 'predicted_label': 12}, {'text': 'ould have been more pink and moisture in that patty. Regardless, I savored my soft, meaty, crunchy, creamy, tangy, salty creation, no holds barred. \\n\\nKay and I each ordered a combo that got us individual servings of their french fries, which honestly could have benefited from another plunge in hot fat and a bit of sea salt.  Passable, greasy steak fries they were even if the other location\\'s Original Hot Dog Shop-quality was not achieved here. \\n\\nWe also shared a customized hot dog with bacon, bbq sauce, pickle spear, and diced onion on a pretzel bun and were left feeling pretty satisfied with what we\\'d concocted, the chewy, doughy bun pretty much making the frank. \\n\\nThis satellite has some bugs to shake out of its turbines, but with a nifty business model and above average food, I think BnDz will become a fixture throughout Pittsburgh much like My Big Fat Greek Gyro has.\\nFrank and Shirley\\'s is yet another place in my domain (Gotham has Batman, the South Hills have...me. ) that I\\'ve pas\\nsed a million times yet hadn\\'t gotten around to trying until Yelp became my new online addiction. \\n\\nI had heared that F&S\\'s has top-notch, but breakfast isn\\'t something I\\'m brave enough to attempt take-out on (my rock and roll schedule is both curse and blessing like rock and roll itself or a vampire bite), so I went with a cheeseburger and fries. \\n\\nAnd ya know what? This burger is a contender! The patty itself is as sauced as a frat boy on a Southside Saturday night, man, not dry in the least. The lettuce, tomato, and onion were all nicely unwilted, and the bun was squishy like Play Dough, which is a quality I love in any hoagie, hamburger, or hot dog bun because it tells me that the bread is as freshly baked as a pothead. Nice.\\n\\nI suspect the fries are frozen, though, so one star off for that. Not that they were bad, but I doubt these came from potatoes cut in-house, which are always better, especially when they\\'re fried twice, not once, twice in peanut oil...or lard. Well, maybe lar\\nd\\'s asking too much (it\\'s uncommon in these parts).\\n\\nI had a cut of chocolate cake also. I should have asked if they bring their desserts in or make them on the premises but forgot. Regardless of that, the cake was bakery quality; moist, sweet, with a dark chocolate batter and a lighter chocolate butter cream icing. The gal gave me a nice FAT wedge to boot. From what I could tell, I got the very last slice. For once luck was on my side since this was deadly good chocolate cake, the reason it\\'s often called Devil\\'s Food. \\n\\nSome other notes on F&S\\'s...\\n\\n1) It\\'s a nice, quiet, clean little restaurant.\\n\\n2)They add a 25 cent charge for take-out orders. Maybe it\\'s for the styrofoam containers. I can only guess, but I don\\'t mind a bit. \\n\\n3) On weekends they\\'re open 24 hours! Yep. From Friday at 5:30am to Sunday at 7:00pm they are open non-stop. Now I have a late-night alternative to Denny\\'s or Eat \\'N Park, and you do too! I wish I knew this ten years ago. \\n\\n4)You can play the lottery here via\\n a drive-in window! How novel. So bring your appetite and that list of numbers that you dreamt. It might ber yer lucky day. \\n\\nRevolt against chain eateries...if it\\'s not too much trouble of course, and F&S\\'s is right in the city, so you have no excuse.\\nThere\\'s an E \\'n P in swanky Sewickley, imagine that. Being all out of ideas and having no time to research virgin restaurant territory for Yelperial jihad, I decided upon this satellite of the venerable chain, one we\\'ve zipped by a zillion times without battin\\' an eye.\\n\\nGeez, I walked in, and the decor was so trendy looking, I thought I\\'d be asked to put on a jacket! A high rent Eat \\'N Park in a high rent neighborhood, I\\'m shocked it wasn\\'t gated! \\n\\nWhat to order, what to order? Hmmm...I know...\\n\\nGrilled Chicken Quesadillas! \\n\\nAw man, why do they tell you they used jarred salsa? I suppose I should applaud their honesty. Aside from that, the chicken was chargrilled without being at all dry, the chipolte sauce was milky and mildly kickin\\',\\n the flour tortilla was sturdy yet pliable, and the Pepper Jack cheese was...pepper jack cheese (has there ever been a bad pepper jack?). I\\'ve actually had these before at a different E \\'N P and enjoyed them back then too. \\n\\nConsider the Philly Cheese Steak. It\\'s supposed to be \"street\" y\\'know? It\\'s supposed to drip. It\\'s supposed to be served by a jerk having a ten-year-long bad day. It\\'s supposed to have Cheez Whiz or bechamel or fondue all over it or whatever.\\n\\nI don\\'t care. This blew apart my expectations, something I chose randomly no doubt because I was dead set again\\'t getting a burger. \\n\\nHow to say this without sounding like the Child Eater from Pan\\'s Labyrinth?\\n\\nThe roll is was served on felt like a baby.  I know I said something similar about Calabria\\'s calzones, but man alive, this sandwich was a joy to hold as well as...ulp...eat? \\n\\nThe steak was choice, the onions were like candy, and the neatly melted American cheese cut in beautifully. Nothing tasted frozen, gummy, rehea', 'actual_label': 12, 'predicted_label': 12}, {'text': 'ted. Everything stayed put. No mess, just a damn good sandwich, just the kind I needed to finish my workweek. If I were a drinkin\\' man, I\\'d want a pint \\'o piss to go along with it.  Instead I got fries and a Pepsi. \\n\\nI hadn\\'t had grilled stickies in eons, so that\\'s what was for dessert. Who thought to serve these with ice cream, and why haven\\'t they been given a prize of some sort. Why nuke a cinnamon roll when you can butter \\'em and put them on a griddle? A microwave cannot create those saltysweetcrispy edges that you forget exist on the things until your nearly finished with them, making your mouth joyous and your heart sad that dessert is close to being over. \\n\\nNow we gotta go to the E \\'N P in Bellevue! It comes before this one when traveling to boom Chippa wah wah. Ask Kay what that\\'s all about.\\nI dislike fast food for the most part. Every Burger King and McDonald\\'s can go fall into a chasm for all I care. \\n\\nBut I must say that Wendy\\'s has pretty good burgers. The fact that they ar\\nen\\'t frozen helps. I prefer the 1/2 Lb. Double Cheeseburger with everything, by the way. They also try to have an expansive menu that hits the target sometimes but also misses a bit.\\n\\nMy opinion on Frostys (Frosties?): They  are best after they\\'ve been in the freezer for a couple of hours and then eaten with a real spoon, not a plastic one. \\n\\nHowever, the service at every Wendy\\'s seems to be seriously lacking. We\\'ve only ever gotten drive-thru at this location, and they always forget something or make an error. The staff also appears to be overstressed and overworked and surely underpaid. \\n\\nThis is one reason why I favor living wage legislation: Higher wages=better service.\\nA coupon for Carbonara\\'s from one of those local, advert-ridden Town Planner Community Calendars had been nagging at me for months. Further exacerbating my itch, a woman we met at a Clutch concert earlier in the year told us she worked there, urging us come to come over for a spot of food. Last Sunday evening, a bel\\neaguered Kay begged me to order pizza. Remembering the woman and the coupon and realizing I had yet to eat at Carbonara\\'s, we placed a takeout order, whisking through Dormont, Mount Lebanon,  and back to Beechview. \\n\\nThe ticket was good for a free white pizza with the purchase of two large pies, toppings and other extras notwithstanding. \\n\\nI caught sight of the fellow Clutch fan as we awaited our food, but she was busy with patrons at the bar and was likely too buzzed the night of the aforementioned show to remember us, I imagine. So we let her be.\\n\\nThe dining room was bustling with middle-aged and elderly customers as expected. Booth seats resembled leather couches, and overall, the decor looked somewhat unfinished. Teen and twentysomething servers skipped about, trying hard to stay on top of demand and seemingly succeeding. Welcome to Shoppin\\' Center Suburbia on a South Hills Sunday evening. \\n\\nEach pizza, from the small white, to the two colossal regulars were centered around a crust\\n that felt like a cracker on the outside and sourdough bread on the inside. Other analogies that come to mind are flatbreads and pita. The sauce was miniscule, stingy even, but the lardy, party-hearty provolone (not mozzarella) was in abundance, forming strands with each pull from the teeth. The toppings for each were all fantastic. Be it bacon, olives, mushrooms, pepperoni, or tomato, none of them were swept up in the mix. The mushrooms were fresh, the bacon seemed cooked to order, and the tomato slices were straight from a backyard garden. The white pizza, however, with its garlic, olive oil, and grated Romano, stood out from its other behemothic brothers with its confident flavor profile. Had the sauce been more plentiful, these dough saucers would have soared to a 5 with no turbulence encountered. \\n\\nDessert for me was a breezy, angelic, coffee-soaked primer on Tiramisu. Espresso-dusted, the cube of mascarpone was elegantly mousse-like, burying the pappy ladyfingers beneath in off-w\\nhite luxury with hints of liquor subverting inhibitions slightly. It was fit for the opera. \\n\\nHere you have it, ladies, germs, foodies, and snobs, your quintessential, no-frills Italian-American family restaurant. Enjoy the 22 year-old Carbonara\\'s for what it is and for what they do or kiss a bull\\'s ass.\\nWe ordered out from here recently, and it wasn\\'t a bad pizza at all. We got a \"works\" or \"supreme\" pizza (I can\\'t recall the exact name, but it had everything on it), and it was decent. I have had better to tell the truth. They have tiramisu also, which is excellent. They\\'re a little pricey though. $32 for a small pizza and a salad!\\n\"Put me in coach, I\\'m ready to play...today...\"\\n\\nI had to go and quote John Fogerty, now didn\\'t I?\\n\\nObvious sports and classic rock references aside, Kay and I had a grand slam of a lunch here recently. \\n\\nOccupying the former spot of the late, lamented Whiskey Hollow Grill, Coach\\'s interiors are sparse, achromatic. For a sports-themed establishment on a Sun', 'actual_label': 12, 'predicted_label': 12}, {'text': 'day afternoon, the ambience was rather low-key despite there being a ballgame on the telly. Our Pittsburgh Pirates were in the midst of a rally as we dined.\\n\\nA lively, lovely, and agile server by the name of Dani brought to us a buttery bunch of their patented Pub Pretzels for our first inning. These toasted, crispy, chewy, gorgeous billyclubs of dough and salt glistened in the light, putting stadium pretzels on the bench. A creamy and potent  Yuengling beer cheese accompanied the batons, making them as worthy of fame as their menu claims them to be. \\n\\nNext at bat was an easily appetizing bowl of \"Chef Ed\\'s Famous She-Crab Soup.\" Smooth and luscious like the best chowders, it maintained a richness without smothering the natural flavors of the abundant crabmeat. \\n\\nA first-class, \"O\"-league pile of \"seasoned salt fries\" that were most likely battered due to their brittle properties seconded a burger called simply \"The Coach.\"\\n\\nLettuce, tomato, a magnificently moist and honeyed pulled por\\nk, a milky/crunch-a-rific cole slaw, and an onion ring topped an ideal medium-rare patty of sultry ground chuck in a bun of Italian bread. It was the equivalent of Andrew McCutchen making a 9th inning moon shot with the bases loaded while down by 3 runs. \\n\\nA wedge of dense, candy-studded, salty-vs-sugary Toffee Cheesecake ended the game with an already padded lead. \\n\\nWhile I may miss the Whiskey Hollow Grill, I\\'ve found that Coach\\'s is worth rooting for. Jump on the bandwagon with me.\\nMy wacky girlfriend and I were there for lunch today. She had the gyro and loved it. I had the souvlaki sandwich and loved it.  She had their cheesecake and loved it. I had the tiramisu and loved it. We both had the ranch fries (circular fries sorta halfway between a fry and a chip) and loved them. She got the check...and I love her. \\n\\nSeriously, it\\'s a neat little place. Yinz should go.\\n\\nOh, I forgot. They have octopus on their menu! Octopus! In Brookline!!!! I must try!\\nMcFadden\\'s was the one place near\\n Stage AE that we\\'d put off going to, but in all sobriety, I had a commendable pre-concert meal here recently. \\n\\nOur appetizer, the cream cheese-based Kilmore Quay Crab Dip, was loaded with lump crab meat and baby spinach, making it an ooey gooey mortar for the chewy but crisp garlic pita toast points that were tasty enough to be eaten plain, quite frankly. A similar starter from Thee Olde Place Inn was pleasantly recalled. \\n\\nIn regards to my main course, I did something I have never done before. \\n\\nWhen my medium-rare burger came to the table with all the pink and juiciness cooked out of it, I sent it back.\\n\\nThe exchange resulted in a profit of flavor via a luscious, rosy patty that dripped flavor like a honeydew melon. The Steel City Burger giddily defames Primanti Brothers by including a milky cole slaw (instead of a vinaigrette slaw) and peeled french fries (adequately prepared to boot) inside a wrinkled, glossy, soft, buttered bun. Each bite was creamy, crunchy, carnivorous joy. \\n\\n\\nA helping of housemade, cauldron-crisp potato chips completed the entree for me in sea-salted, can\\'t-eat-just-one, gourmet supermarket fashion. And there was a time when I thought New York Deli\\'s purple bags of chips were the snack food pinnacle. Damn, was I young and sheltered. \\n\\nAh! Fashion. Well, I may not recall our server\\'s name, but I do recall that she was dressed like any other gal you\\'d see walking or jogging about in comfortable athletic attire. Lascivious? Revealing? Inappropriate? Hardly. Furthermore, she was attentive, talkative, and very nice to my girlfriend and I. \\n\\nI just turned 40, am in a serious relationship, and I liked McFadden\\'s more than I anticipated. \\n\\nP.S.

Today, I didn\\'t bring a lunch to work and decided to take a chance. \\n\\nWhy did it take me so long? \\n\\nI was greeted by a jovial man with an accent and moustache. I knew they had gyros since it says so in the window, and I love gyros, so I hadda partake, especially when I saw an actual gyro spit behind the counter. That shouts authenticity, y\\'know? \\n\\nNow, it  doesn\\'t conquer It\\'s Greek To Me\\'s godly gyro, but it certainly tests my neighborhood\\'s own Herculean Greek sandwich, and only barely loses out. \\n\\nBut comparisons be damned, this is a mighty gyro in its own right.

A young man with hair long enough for me to wonder if he was depressed over having to miss an important metal concert just doors away utilized some sort of hand-held electric slicer with a disc for a blade, whizzing and whirring away at the lamb loaves flicked by small orange flames, manufacturing flaps and flaps of grey-ish, speckled protein. He crafted at least 10 gyros as I sat in a wobbly chair at a wobbly table sipping on a Hi-C watching coverage of the recent Boston Marathon bombings unfurl horrifically.\\n\\nThe more my Souvlaki was delayed, the deeper the feeling of potential disappointment sank into my heart, paralleling that of current evens. I watched the nuggets of pork being neglected and could almost smell them burning as news of the dead and injured flashed on the television. \\n\\nWhen the sandwich arrived in front of me with no plate provided, my hunch proved correct.\\n\\nThe meat wa\\ns the consistency of a door stopper. It felt as if I had stolen a 100-piece o-ring set from a plumber in a fit of insanity and was trying to chew a handful of them. The pita bread haplessly crumbled upon each bite as chunks of elastic beef spilled out of it, bouncing...bouncing off of the table\\'s surface, nearly scalding my mouth.\\n\\n\"We have no idea right now who did this or why, just to reiterate,\" I heard a male, middle-aged voice state coldly, his deep, authoritative voice resonating throughout the busy restaurant.\\n\\nWith 1/4 of the sandwich left to eat, I hurled the rest of the sham into a trash bin and left angrily.\\n\\n\"What\\'s wrong, man?\" One of my buddies asked. I was silent.\\n\\n\"What happened? Didja get the gyro?\" Matt knew something was amiss. \\n\\n\"No, I uh...got Souvlaki.\"\\n\\n\"What??? You dumb-ass!\" The sound of a dozen groans and half as many hands smacking against foreheads could be heard. \\n\\n\"I need dessert,\" I blurted flatly. With some more time left to spend and wanting to leave di\\nsappointment behind, I headed over to The Milkshake Factory for comfort. \\n\\nA lesson was learned: Just order the gyro at Mike & Tony\\'s. Exploring the remainder of their menu will result in grief, one that cannot be compared to that which was brought about in another state or is rained down daily overseas by our military but grief nonetheless.\\n\\nP.S. I should note that I\\'ve also been to M&T\\'s Downtown Pittsburgh location and had a much better experience, their gyros being very moist, tasty, generously appointed, and filling (that tzatziki sauce could use a little more zip, however). Not ordering the gyro was folly.\\nKay and I finally dropped by PG&SB prior to catching Trivium and Devildriver at Stage AE recently, the eatery/watering hole\\'s proximity to the concert venue proving invaluable. \\n\\nIn reading some of the previous reviews, I\\'ve noticed a heap of scorn being hurled at the service. In all honesty, we had zero issues with the hospitality. Our waiter, whose name escapes me, was friend\\nly and adept. PG&SB was surprisingly barren on a Friday evening, something that put the young, tattooed, light-footed garcon at ease. I\\'m sure he deserved an easy night for a change. \"It\\'s been crazy lately with the big rubber duck and the Pirates. Whew. I\\'m glad it\\'s a little slow,\" He said. \\n\\nRegarding cleanliness, the restaurant was immaculate from what I could tell. I noticed no foul smells, dirty tables, dingy silverware, or spotty glasses. \\n\\nWhy am I only giving them a 3 out of 5? For starters, I should say that my 3 will be a very high 3, but that rating falls short of a 4 (which is what I wish I could give them) due to a dinner that teetered between the markers of \"Bravo!\" and \"Blah\" too often.\\n\\nOnce again, I came very close to ordering a burger as I do much too often in restaurants such as these, but deciding to halt that compulsion in its tracks, I rolled the bones and went with a Pittsburgh Steak Sandwich. The shaved ribeye, grilled peppers and onions, and a wad of melted pr', 'actual_label': 12, 'predicted_label': 12}, {'text': 'ovolone in a mushy, perfect Portugeuse-ish submarine roll was as enjoyable a Philly \"wit\" as any I could possibly devour in Steeltown. The meat was generous, the cheese was oozy, the vegetables were properly caramelized, stooping sidewalk pleasures were had. I almost wanted to stand up and eat it over a counter. \\n\\nThose accompanying french fries, however, were quite obviously frozen, something that need not have been. And no, they were not in the sandwich, nor was coleslaw present.  Are ya kiddin\\' me? Cut up some taters, and twice-fry \\'em, guys!  If I can do it...hell, if teenagers working at Kennywood for the summer can...\\n\\nRedundancy be damned, Kay and I shared some pierogi for an appetizer. Plump and delicate, they invoked gently boiled ravioli or gnocchi with their garlic butter, sauteed peppers and onions, and Parmesan. Only some marinara sauce was missing, but we made do with that which never fails to tempt tongues and soothe heat: sour cream. Again, writing candidly (as always, \\ndespite what my detractors say), PG&SB\\'s pierogi were outstanding and rank among the very best I\\'ve ever feasted (beasted?) on. \\n\\nThe Homemade Brownie a la Mode, another obsession of mine, was our shared dessert by default, and wasn\\'t much more than what its title indicates. There were blobs of vanilla ice cream and ribbons of hot fudge involved. It seemed thrown together. The plating was unimaginative, and the brownie itself lacked the fudgy, just-baked oomph I anticipate when I order such a thing. I\\'ve heard better renditions of this song, and they\\'ve been many. \\n\\nDamn. Here I am, still weighing my grade. \\n\\nLook, omitting dessert and those factory fries, PG&SB would garner a 4 from my keystrokes without any nail-biting , but with a run-of-the-mill menu of bar food at hand, this place needs everything to be stellar, and our meal didn\\'t reach enough of those gastronomic highs for me (see Sidelines in Millvale for what typical pub munchies can and should be).  In other words, FRESH frie\\ns and brownies that murder with decadence need to happen here. Homemade ice cream and hot fudge wouldn\\'t hurt either. Those pierogi and that cheesesteak can most certainly stay.\\nThis is an excellent facility for that time in your life when you accumulate too much...stuff and need more room for that stuff.\\n\\nI\\'m channeling George Carlin now.\\n\\nYeah, I reluctantly went down with my sister and got a storage unit for the two of us a few years ago.\\n\\nShe has too much stuff too. \\n\\nMy reluctance subsided a bit when I got here since the staff was so helpful and nice. It actually became an adventure of sorts. It\\'s like a big maze. lol. Or a fun version of Arkham Asylum or The Vault. \\n\\nThe day we first started putting our stuff away, I got flustered after stubbing my thumb on something, and banged one of the other storage units with my fist. \\n\\nI heard laughter. Someone must have had some sort of toy in there. It was cackling away like the Joker. My sister and her friend, who was helping us, got a k\\nick out of that. lol. \\n\\n\"Ha! Someone\\'s toys are laughin\\' at you!\"\\n\\nPointin\\' and chucklin\\' at me they were. Grrrrr....\\n\\nYeah, I had to put a bunch of my comics here. But I\\'m not worried about them because they\\'re secure.  This place is tight. You need security codes just to get in, and there are cameras everywhere. No one\\'s stealing yer stuff. Nor is it going to get leaked on or damaged in any way. \\n\\nThey\\'re also open 24/7, which is very convenient. My sister\\'s afraid to go at night though. :D  She watches too many movies. \\n\\nThey even have climate controlled units, band rehearsal rooms, and will lend you a gassed up truck for free when you move in. \\n\\nThis used to be the old Duquesne Brewery if you can believe it. My how South Side has changed. Speaking of South Side, it\\'s a great location for me since it\\'s pretty close to home. \\n\\nPlus, as the redheaded girl who initially rented the unit to us sez, \"Yinz can stack,\" thereby maximizing space. \\n\\nSo don\\'t go out and buy a bigger house for y\\nour stuff just yet.\\n\\nWARNING: Make sure you pay your bill every month. I have automatic payments set up, and twice this year, I switched cards because of my bank and forgot to tell them. Nonetheless, I got notices in the mail  since the old cards didn\\'t go through.  They will tack on late fees and even auction off your stuff if you don\\'t pay. Luckily it didn\\'t get that far. Whew!\\nMy parents and I recently ordered takeout from here last week, and I can candidly attest that IGTM still prepares THE absolute gyro in the entire metropolitan area. Unmatched in quality, its meat is still succulent, its tzatziki sauce still as tangy as it is manna-bound, its batura-like pita bread toasted to achieve the ideal balance of crispness and spongy richness, its vegetables are still farm-fresh, and the entire proto-sandwich is still dusted with that magical, colorful blend of herbs and spices that tempt the eyes as well as the tongue.

Is that illegal?\\n\\nI only waited a few minutes for my food, and it was still warm when I got  it to work. The burger was sort of a cross between a pub burger and a fast-food style burger (not fast-food but fast-food style. try http://aht.seriouseats.com/archives/2009/09/a-guide-to-glossary-of-regional-american-burger-cheeseburger-styles-and-cooking-methods.html?ref=skybox2) and I must say was a few notches above par. The patty was perfectly fine, the onions, tomato, and lettuce fresh, but THAT...BUN made the damn burger. What bakery \\nthey come from I don\\'t know, but if I hadda guess I\\'d say Kribel\\'s. \\n\\nIt was good enough to eat every single day, so I am a fan. \\n\\nNo complaints have I in the french fries dept. either. I dunno Bethany, mine looked and tasted freshly cut. I still saw peel on the ends of \\'em.  These weren\\'t Ore-Idas. \\n\\nSince I was using a debit card, and they have an $8 minimum (remember that kiddies) I got not one but two slices of their only dessert offering today; Coconut Cream Pie. \\n\\nAgain, it was solidly good, not to mention crumbly graham cracker- crusted with toasted coconut shavings atop the clouds of cream. Everything I had averaged a mean 4 out of 5. \\n\\nThe inside is as quaint as it is hectic. Guy Fieri\\'s hip \\'n wacky visage looms large o\\'er yer heads as you dine. The service was efficient and friendly, and the atmosphere was cozy despite the waitstaff whirling about the place like frantic, happy dervishes. One thing is certain; The Dor-Stop is most deservedly a hit in the South Hills, and they\\n were particularly hoppin\\' and happenin\\' this morning without missing a note.\\n\\nBut something tells me the real test will be a good, hearty breakfast. A long weekend is in my future. Shall I return for their wild renditions of pancakes, French toast, and omelets? Methinks I \\'aint tasted nothin\\'  yet.\\nPrior to this past Friday night, I stopped into this establishment -- one that was formerly the rough-n-tumble dive bar known as Salac\\'s -- on several occasions only to be told that they were cash only and weren\\'t serving food yet. Not being a drinker, I have no reason to enter a bar unless a meal and/or live music can be had or heard. Roughly 32 hours ago, payday to be exact, I decided to attempt dinner at Salud one last flamin\\' time, telling myself as I walked briskly on a brusquely cold late afternoon that I would give up on the joint if I was informed yet again that no menu was ready. \\n\\nThankfully for my sanity, and my grumbling tummy, a menu board was visible on the sidewalk in front o\\nf Salud as I approached it. Furthermore, credit card insignias could be seen on the window. My persistence would pay handsome dividends. \\n\\nAs I entered the darkened, sparsely-populated bar portion of Salud, I was greeted by a tattooed mixologist in jet-black attire. \\n\\n\"I came to eat,\" I explained in terms that were not uncertain.\\n\\n\"Sure thing, man,\" He replied as he directed me to the table of my choice.  A friendly middle-aged fellow in a shirt and tie who resembled a human resources manager more than a restauranteur would eagerly and graciously take down my order. \\n\\nNot particularly caring about the college basketball game that the two patrons in the bar were fixated on, I opted to sit in the homey, faux wood-paneled dining room in the back which stood in stark contrast to the bar with its bright, white walls. In regards to the decor, Salac\\'s is still very much with Salud, but that\\'s where the building\\'s ornery, onerous past ends. \\n\\nOrder the Lechon sandwich, and you\\'ll temporarily i\\nmagine yourself standing on a street corner in downtown Miami or Havana munching on nothing more or less than some of the most resonantly rich, ramshackle, mojo-anointed pulled pork to ever be placed between the fold of a lardy, lusty submarine bun and cooked in a panino press. A grilled cheese with no grilled cheese, I savored it with a helping of fluffy, delicate, and mysteriously seasoned french fries. \\n\\nAlso had was an appetizer of fried, timidly sweet plaintain chunks that simply needed more salt to perk them up. \\n\\nAfter finishing my dinner, I ordered a Cuban sandwich to take home to Kay (they had no desserts for service that evening despite listing them on their bill of fare) that somehow managed to stay warm all the way home in the face of a bus ride, a trolley ride, and chilly weather. Surprisingly, our microwave ended up with a night off.\\n\\nAnd my, my, my, were the aromas enough to arouse the taste buds of my fellow passengers as many eyes zoomed in on drowsy and satiated me.

Imagine further, pure baked ecstasy. \\n\\nAlso bought, shared, and gobbled was a nonpareil tuna mel\\nt hoagie that was heavy on the herbed (uncanned?) tuna salad and cheese which formed strings when the sandwich was pulled from our mouths following each blissful bite. \\n\\nTo my taste nodules and breadbasket, there are superior pizza parlors to be found in our amazing city, but Pizza Perfectta is admirable enough to manage a spot in the top 20% with little effort. \\n\\nP.S.

They specialize in Korean-style Chinese food (i.e. the champong) as well as other traditional Korean dishes.  Nice place.  Not fancy, but never disappoints.\\nWhenever I walk in to that place (I work in the area), I KNOW that I am doing the Toronto Trendoid thing.  It is very designer-ish.  BUT, before you all pounce on me, the coffee here is good.  Second to none.  Their pastries look divine.  Counter service is very much in keeping with the place but bottom line:  good coffee.  Smooth.  Refined.\\nWent back there today.  It appears as though they are back on track quality of food wise.  However, no more little towels to wipe your hands (unfortunately).  The quality of the winter panchan was very good, the chonggukchang chigae was really, really good this afternoon.  Waitress remembered us (hopefully in a positive way) ... LOL.  They are back on track.  I was worried after the last experience!  This is a good place with refined, Korean cooking.  One of our regular go-to l\\nunch spots. YUM!\\nWe have gone to this place for years, mostly in the fall and winter months and it never disappoints.  The owner\\'s wife is a terrific cook.  Their speciality is the yang-yang tang - lamb (goat) soup in a rich pepper broth with gae-nip (shiso leaves) as flavouring.  Exquisite.  Their samgyetang is very popular there as well - they bring the whole pot and cooker to your table and watch the chicken, stuffed with sticky rice, ginseng and Korean dates furiously cook.  The panchan is always good - in particular the braised tubu.  Nice place.  Not fancy but never disappoints.\\nThis place is consistent.  We had not been there for a very long time and it was good.\\n\\nStaff there are always pleasant.  Never had a bad experience service-wise.  There is a Manager on site who keeps the place running smoothly.  The hot and sour soup there is terrific.  The Shaolong bau are mmmm melt in your mouth with just the right amount of golden liquid inside each one.  Oh my ... the fried taofu wit\\nh garlic ... lovely.\\n\\nWas a bit disappointed with the rice rolls with pork floss.  A bit too much rice and not enough floss ...\\n\\nOtherwise, good experience overall.  As always.\\nWent there today - the first time since last winter.  One word:  OUTSTANDING!!!  This is the way real, traditional, home cooking is supposed to  taste like.  The owner\\'s wife does the cooking and everything she prepares is with the utmost care.  Had the yanggogi jongol with minari and gaenip (lamb stew with watercress and shiso leaf).  They give you extra seasonings on the side to add to it - OMG ... its impossible to stop at just one bowl ...\\n\\nThe panchan was not as good as I remember but the yeolmu kimchi, baechu kimchi and the tofu were very, very well prepared.  Be prepared to experience a LOT of red chili in the food. Spouse and I agreed that this is one of the best Korean meals we have had in a very long time.\\nDid not expect anything as I went in there for regular stuff like laundry detergent, etc.\\n\\nThey h\\nave a very well-stocked selection of items from all over S.E. and E. Asia.  They have a Gloucester Bakery at the back but my experience with Gloucester Bakery near Sunny Grocery Store on Ravel Road (nasty woman who scowls at everyone and has a comment for everything/everyone from behind the counter), has left me with a very negative view - this location may have different owners, honestly, I do not know.  \\n\\nOverall, this store was a cut-above the regular No Frills.  I found dragon fruit on sale (fresh, firm) for $2.99/lb.  Oranges $1/lb (fresh).  They have a good housewares section and also a well-stocked pharmacy.  Who would have thunk it?  Was pleasantly surprised!  Met my needs and will more, for the future!\\nIts good and they carry what I am looking for.  They have all the SA goodies.  Jams, chocolates, \"biscuits\" (cookies).  Don\\'t care for the boerewors there - its better at Florence Meats.  They carry most everything that reminds me of childhood.\\nI have to update this place to a f\\nive.  It was always good, no doubt about it, but it is under new management and even more delicious than before.  This is the place to go for true Korean Chinese-style food.  Their champong is absolutely divine, not too greasy with generous amounts of garlic and seafood.  Noodles cooked just right.  Yum.  Had the jajamyeon today for the first time since Korea and it was really bang on.  The panchan is delish and they had FRESH home made tofu as part of it.  The waitresses are very welcoming and its always a nice experience eating and drinking (soju or maekju) there.  Only drawback is the grilling can make the air a bit smoky so take a seat in the front portion of the restaurant if you\\'re not grilling or BBQ\\'ing.  The soju is there, the panchan is great and the food and service impeccable.  Consistently good.\\nNot a happy place.  Counter staff clearly would be doing anything else but be there.

DO NOT get the rice noodles with black bean sauce and beef.  It is seriously, seriously greasy.  The tea - well, if you are picky, you need to bring your own - just ask for hot water.  The tea there is pretty rough.  Also, the noodles arrived cold, i.e. cold thick rice noodles which were greasy.  Not too appetizing ... I will give them one more chance only because I do believe the quality of the food there is good.  Two girls who we shared a table with were having spicy beef and it looked DIVINE!!!!!  They also have the deep fried squid tentacles - maybe next time ... \\n\\nPerhaps the chef who prepared the mian fan was having a bad day ...\\nFirstly, this is \"no frills\" in every sense.\\n\\n\\nDon\\'t expect manners here from ANYONE.  \\n\\nProduce - fresh (not much of a variety).  Good selection of imported yoghurts/cheese from the U.S.  Other than that.  BLAH.  Very aggravating place to shop.\\nWent there last night to pick up some stuff. They have a good variety of S.E. Asian condiments and noodles - several brands of pancit canton (which are so easy and delicious to prepare at home).  Fruit/vegetable area has improved.  They had fragrant guava imported from Mexico yesterday - and you can always find Thai basil here as well as FRESH PANDAN and galangal (if you get there early on a Saturday).  This store also carries a lot of Korean products (at a reasonable price - certainly less than the Korean stores) and also a good selection of Taiwanese products.\\n\\nThe fish counter:  improved somewhat - the staff who work there are very obliging and helpful.\\nI know, an update of an update of an update ... \\n\\nEvery time I go there, its like \"this is the best jjeok I have ever had\", and the nex\\nt time is even better.  There was a long wait yesterday to get a table (Mother\\'s Day) but man was it ever worth the wait.  The jjeok was like silk - smooth, just enough ginger, perfectly seasoned (I always add a dash of pepper), the chong fan were like pockets of silk with the most exquisite mushroom filling.  This place is tried.  True.  Reliable.  Never disappoints.  What can I say.  I love, love Congee Wong.\\nMy first time in there and never, ever again.  The most miserable, nasty, hostile, rudest customer service imaginable (cheese counter).  With this obnoxious \"customer service\", it is a miracle to me that people even want to shop here.  I still like Nino D\\'Aversa on Keele Street.  They do it right at that location.  This place needs to learn from the Keele Street location what customer service really means.\\nYou get what you pay for - and thi$ place is worth every penny.  Good variety of non-dairy and regular gelato.  Something new they have to offer - ICED CAPPUCCINO OMG!  Not ov\\nerly sweet, and just the right portion to hit the spot.\\n\\nTheir baked goods seem to have diminished somewhat - but that\\'s not the reason I go there.  It is for the superb customer service and excellent variety, choices and quality of gelato.  Nice place.  Always busy.  No surprise!\\n3.5\\nI have to be fair in my review.  I have not been there in years, but I needed a decent quality leather belt, and figured we\\'d go in there.  Lots of stores, clearly not doing too well (by appearances).  Not much of a variey and expensive.  I will pay - but it has to be worth it (Brooks Brothers is there and they are consistent - cut above, classy and not ostentatious).\\n\\nThe \"mall\" is clean.  But what makes this place deserving of an almost 4 star is their spotlessly, spotlessly clean toilets/washroom.  I have a phobia about public toilets - this place is spotless.  \\n\\nOtherwise, can\\'t see myself coming back to shop here.\\nThis place is awesome; Hansik at its best.  The panchan is the best I have had in Toron\\nto, without exception.  Namul like Halmoni used to make.  OMG.  Try their vegetarian fillings with different greens used as wraps (for 2), yuk kae jang, kimchi chigae, chungukchang chigae and nyengmyeon (bibim and mul).  Owner takes a lot of care in the presentation of dishes.  The mackerel (grilled) was fall off the bone tender witha crispy, grilled skin, just the way it should be.  Pass on the grilled squid and spicy pork on a sizzling plate - too greasy for my taste.  Other than that, perfection.  The panchan is as good as its gets, if not better than in Korea.  The eggplant panchan ...  OMG ... not greasy, just the right amount of light coloured soya sauce.  Amazing place.  They\\'ve been around for a few years and have maintained the same standards.  Mostly Korean clientele and a very quiet and pleasurable dining experience.\\nAttended a wedding there.  Food bland and not served piping hot the way I like it.

This has become a bit of a Saturday morning hipster experience and also lots of young families with strollers, etc.  The fruit and vegetable shops are expensive.  I like the fish store (Domenic's - good quality product and reliable service), (Olympic cheese - good variety of cheeses from around the world) as well as the availability of venison and ostrich at the butcher.  I try and avoid going there on a Saturday morning - too crowded.\\nFINALLY I have found a good Vietnamese restaurant in Toronto!!!!\\n\\nWaited for a while - busy place (and for good reason).\\n\\nThe Pho with chicken and flank (beef) was exceptional. \\n Was definitely a broth that had simmered for a long time - natural taste - with a good aroma and select spices - could taste what appeared to be star anise ... yummm.  A comforting, gorgeous, clear un-fatty broth.  Meat cooked perfectly.  Thai basil and other greens and bean sprouts were clean and fresh.  Salad rolls had perfect ratios of basil to lettuce to shrimp.  Hoisin dipping sauce - gorgeous.  The ca phe dha was strong, not too sweet and iced.  Took me back to my favourite sidewalk coffee place in Ho Chi Minh City.\\n\\nCondiment containers (hoisin, chili pepper paste and Sriracha bottles) clean.  Tables clean. Restroom - spotless.  Just a good, pleasant vibe and superb food.  Definitely on the regular go-to list now.  Thank you to my colleague Jason H. for recommending this amazing place.\\nThis place has definitely improved since our last visit.  Lots of US patrons who were visiting Canada (Memorial Day weekend).  Restaurant was busy, food is good.  Panchan - ok, not spectacular, b\\nut ok.\\n\\nThe mul-nyengmyeon was very nice.  Generous portion, noodles perfect and the ice-base perfectly balanced.  My Spouse's kimchi-chigae which arrived in a huge dolsot was EXCEPTIONAL!  Star of the show.  Very traditional flavor and generously seasoned with gochu-garu.  Will be back.  The menu has expanded to include many traditional Korean favourites, like chunggukchang-chigae!\\nWonderful.  Seriously traditional Korean food at its absolute finest.  Items I have not seen since Korea.\\n\\n1.

Quiet and pleasant dining experience!!  Tt'o manayo!!!!!\\nOh yeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah.  Doubles:  soft, pillowy, fluffy dough filled with the best filling and generously so - satisfying, but not heavy.  Alo\\no pie ......... ooooooooh ... the flavour of chadon beni in the doubles - this is truly representative of good Trinidadian food, my goodness.\\n\\nIn a nutshell:  ooooooh.  Ahhhhhhhh.\\n\\nI am lost for words.  Which means.  This place is the real deal.  Their currant rolls ... OMG ... the baigan choka ... (frozen) ... exquisite.  This place is far for me to get to ... but worth it.\\nWOW.  Disaster zone.  Gourmet items all over the place, some packages opened ... yes!  Clothes racks so close together you can barely make it through the racks.  Overstuffed, everything falling off.  I go in once a year to find some Christmas gifts - sometimes they have unique imported gourmet items.  I could not wait to get out of there!!!  This is without a doubt the most disappointing location of Winners I have been to.\\nThis is as good as it gets for authentic, refined, Punjabi cuisine.  The menu is extensive and the quality (kwality!) exceptional.  We tried two goat masala dishes which were outstanding, the gob\\ni and aloo parathas soft and gorgeous, the palak paneer was like silk going down, the eggplant curry had a subtle but yet pronounced blend of masalas and the aloo tikki was divine.  Even the small salad before the meal arrived was fresh and the pickles exquisite.  The place is clean.  Service was impeccable.  Spouse has a lactose intolerance and they were very helpful finding things for him on the menu that he could eat.  The sweets selection is to die for exquisite.  We will be back.  This place was recommended to us by a Punjabi friend.  Word of mouth is definitely always the most reliable.  This place is a bit of a drive to get to but oh, so very worth it.  Love this place.  My new favourite Punjabi restaurant in Toronto.\\n3.5 STARS\\n+++++++++\\nHave been there before and it was a better experience (before), based on what we ordered.  It was at least a five star experience then.\\n\\nWe ordered one bibim nyengmyeon for Hubster and one hwae bibim nyengmyeon for me.  It was gorgeously present\", 'actual_label': 13, 'predicted_label': 13}, {'text': \"ed, no question.  But the gochu-chang was ridiculously over the top very sweet.  It is supposed to be sweet but not like candy!  In Korea, the gochu-chang has a slight sweetness but this was crazy sweet.  The ingredients were OK.  The panchan, except for the kimchi which was well-fermented and strong was lacklustre.  Portions of main course were large.  Oyi kimchi portion was microscopic.  Service was alright.\\n\\nI will go back because this place is clean and the food is generally good.  Will order a ttukbegae next time.  They serve some very traditional Korean dishes which I have not seen in a long time - which will be good for the winter.\\nSpouse and I both went there for breakfast this morning.  Felt like a bowl of comforting pho to start the day.  HUGE pieces of LEAN chicken, clean Thai basil and Vietnamese greens, (including bean sprouts), and the tables and condiments are always clean.\\n\\nWe had not been there for a while and we got a warm welcome.  They are really nice here.  Hardwor\\nking, polite, nice people who run a solid restaurant.  My cafe da was strong, yet smooth and went down nicely ... mmmmm.\\n\\nSoup was slightly salty, but we devoured the noodles (cooked perfectly), the soft, luscious chicken and other vegetables.  I think they have regulars who go there all the time.  Nice place - welcoming feeling like you're eating pho with friends at home.\\nMeh, but there appears to be a glimmer of hope that this will become like the other Winners locations, especially downtown.  Seem to be a lot of new staff who are actually keeping an eye on product display and keeping the store neat(er) than it used to be.  But they have a long way to go.  It is so unfortunate - I'll see a gorgeous designer jacket, skirt or trousers - and upon closer inspection, these garments have been seriously mistreated, tugs, pulls, stains you name it.  In fairness, I guess they can't control how their customers treat someone else's property.  Their gourmet/home section used to be a lot better, \\nespecially the condiment section like different marinades, dry rubs, etc.\\nUsual, no-personality dollar store but it appears to be a clean store.  I picked up some stuff and found a good variety of cookies made in Portugal and Italy.\\n\\nUsual tchotchkess, but not bad.\\n\\nThe lady at the cash counter was polite and gave me a double bag without asking.  I thought that was a plus.\\nI keep on writing updates for places I already love, but Congee Wong never ceases to please.  This place is consistently good.  The congee, in my opinion, is the best in Toronto.  A few varieties, including healthy grains but what I really adore is the chicken and abalone congee, with extra ginger.  Chicken is never fatty, congee is a nice, thick consistency and is served hot.  What is better than a nice, big bowl of congee with youtiao (fried dough sticks) on the side.  Always see regular Saturday customers.  Tried the Hong Kong Special Spicy Chow Mein (#NE2).  it was divine.  Squid was soft and tender, not chewy, s\\neasonings just right.  Scallops also fresh and not overcooked.  Hong Kong coffee wasn't anything special.  This is a truly positive food experience.  The rice rolls (chong fun) are always fantastic and huge.  Tried and true.  Love Congee Wong!\\nMeh.  For people who have shopped in Asia, this is like a desert and I don't mean desert oasis.  Its ok and nothing more.  The only thing that I will say is that they have a good selection of womens' cosmetics and the sunglasses section is acceptable.  Clothing is a big meh for me at this location.\\nI cannot help but rave about this place.  The food is so comforting, it's a quiet place where people go who understand and truly appreciate what good pho is.  Even after a hard week, put a bowl of steaming, warm, fragrant goodness in front of me and my world is bright.  Fresh Thai basil ... mmmm ... fresh salad rolls with a nice hoisin dip ... mmmm ... cafe sua da mmm.  My favourite is the flank beef and chicken or the beef tendon.  The Hue spicy noodl\\ne soup with blood jello is great!  I love this place. It's low-key, the food is good and the price is rea$onable.\\nVisited this incredible place again a week ago.  To the owners of Makkal Chon - be careful your standards don't start slipping - its on the edge.  No more wet towel for your hands like before (especially if you're going to be eating the bossam), the service is very, very slow (especially on a Saturday night).  Time to invest in a second waitress, Adjumoni.  The quality of the food is good, the preparation of the food and the panchan is exquisite.  But I see things slipping a bit.  Don't let it happen - please!   This is such a wonderful place and I would really be disappointed to see those standards drop.  If you are serving bossam - just spend a few dollars and bring back those hand towels.  I wanted to give this a 3.5 from a 4.0 but the system does not allow half stars ...\\nDiscovered this place today by chance.  Happened to be in the Sheppard Centre and saw this place.  A\", 'actual_label': 13, 'predicted_label': 13}, {'text': 'pparently they\\'ve been open since August (did not know about it).  Their UNWRAPPED selection is huge.  Their wrapped selection, less so.  They have a few British imports in the front of the store which is always nice.  I found it average.  Not terrible, but not incredible either.  Basic, with a small British selection which was a pleasant surprise.\\nI love this place; but it has two major drawbacks.  One, price and two, loads of calories.  However, the end result is worth it.  Their frost gelatos are good (try the pineapple), their soy based gelatos (for lactose-intolerant) are acceptable - try the hazelnut - but the truly good stuff are the gelatos made with milk, etc.  Try the \"Zuppa Inglesi\" (English soup?) (which is kind of like a frozen trifle which English people have at Christmas), Rum & Raisin, Dolce Maria (chocolate -- ahhhh) and regular vanilla.  They also have iced capuccinos, etc. if you want to sit down and relax for a while.  You can also take out containers of this stuff.\\n  It is hazardous to one\\'s waistline, this is a fact but probably one of the better gelato places accessible from Toronto. Have seen their pastries but I have to pretend I am not a TOTAL pig ... even though I am sorely tempted to purchase and sample when I go there.  Thankfully summers are not long enough in Canada that I would travel there otherwise I\\'d weigh 300 pounds.\\nWent there last night.  It was definitely soju-night for the Ajossis and Ajumonis!  Lots of laughter and good times (why not)!?\\n\\nThe ttukbegae here is good - all the chigaes are good.  Hubby had kimchi-chigae - delish.  My champong did not hit the spot - it was missing a significant amount of seafood and the broth did not have a deep flavour like in the past.  They gave me garlic slices and samjang on the side (I asked for it) and it helped.  THE HAEMOOL PAJON WAS OUT OF THIS WORLD DELICIOUS, not dripping in oil and perfectly cooked.  This is old-style home made Korean food.\\n\\nI would have given them a five if not for \\nthe lacklustre champong.\\n\\nThis place is very nice.  The wait staff here are nice and work very hard to keep everyone happy.\\nIf you are in the banking district and aimlessly looking for acceptable and palatable fare, try this place.  Not brilliantly incredible but acceptable compared to all the other vile stuff available in the concourse of First Canadian Place.  I generally order the vegetarian bentoh or the pre-prepared maki rolls.  They are not overly generous with the kimchi so you have to ask for more.  The man at the cash desk is a bit grumpy but I joke around with him in Hangul-mal and he perks up and cracks a smile.  This place is a much better alternative to the other stuff around there and is quite satisfying.\\nThis place always misses the mark of being exceptional, and sadly, they have not kept up their game in the past two years.  If you can find greens which are inexpensive, go for it - otherwise, slim pickings on the day we went for fruit.  Store has way too much stuff in i\\nt and you are forever navigating around boxes, displays and/or people.  The fish department is so-so.  It has never been my first choice.\\n\\nThe Tianjin pancake is the big draw for me.  The Furen who makes them does them well - I generally go with no egg, extra \"la\"and with a nice, fattening piece of youtiao inside.\\nI am carefully upgrading this to a 3.  Still a lack of any reasonable food for purchase, still the same austere and cold atmosphere.  However, I am upgrading from 2 to a 3 for our return home on Sunday night.  After enduring a miserable 15 hour flight from Hong Kong in an overheated plane with surly flight staff, it was nice to be able to use the new scanning machines for our passports.  It took off that extra edge of having to wait in yet another long line.  This airport is by no means where it should be in terms of efficiency, but I saw a small improvement and for that I am recognizing it.  They have to work on their carousel management especially for long-haul flights comi\\nng in from overseas.  The carousels are just not big enough to handle luggage for almost 300 people from a flight.  Unacceptable that bags be dumped on a floor ... excuse me?!\\n\\nIf they continue to make these incrementally small steps to make things more efficient as recognized above, I\\'ll be happy.  This airport does not meet the high standards of airports such as Incheon (ROK) or Hong Kong International.  But they could - if only they tried harder.  I am still hopeful ...\\nJung Soo Nae is without a doubt, one of my favourite Korean restaurants in the world.  We do not get there often enough as its far from where we live, but for special occasions, this is thE place to go.  It is like I am back in Korea, enjoying quality panchan (amazing baechu kimchi) and san manul (mountain garlic) which is my favourite panchan ever.  The san manul is prepared with a light soya sauce, mirin and vinegar dressing and it is indescribably delicious.  My fermented soy bean stew (chonggukchang chigae) was d', 'actual_label': 13, 'predicted_label': 13}, {'text': 'ivine (as always).  It is a pleasant dining experience and the focus is on quality, traditional Korean food.  I have known this couple who own this restaurant for almost 20 years and we always receive a warm welcome when we go there.  I wish I lived closer - I\\'d be there every weekend!\\nFIVE BIG ONES FOR THIS TERRIFIC PLACE!!!  Went there for lunch today, were in the mood for good Sri Lankan food where we could sit down and dine, as opposed to taking out (our normal route).  The food?  Incredible.  The service?  Impeccable.  Spotless restaurant.  Pleasant ambience.  We ordered the lunch special with a couple of extras which did not disappoint.  The lunch value is incredible at $9.95 for a choice of appetizer, entree and dessert.  I had a gorgeous fish curry in a rich, Jaffna gravy which was spicy, flavourful with well pronounced spices.  I also had a piece of fish with a dry masala rub which was indescribably good.  Spouse had the mutton curry and they brought us each a side dish with t\\nhree different vegetables:  daal curry, drumstick and potato curry and nicely seasoned pieces of beetroot.  The drinks were refeshing.  I had the lime water (sweetened) and spouse had his usual mango juice.  I cannot say enough good things about this place.  The owner is a wonderful woman who takes care and pride in the quality of food she prepares.  Her niece was our waitress today - very welcoming environment.  This place is a find.  We were thrilled to be able to enjoy authentic Sri Lankan cuisine.  You will not be disappointed if you try it!  We will be back.\\nEXPENSIVE!!!!!  But clean, good quality seafood and fish and the variety is there.  The owners keep a close eye on the staff and you can rest assured of extremely good handling and wrapping of your purchase.  Their Korean-style mandu (hand made) are to die for delicious.  THE BEST GRAVLAX IN TORONTO!!!!!  They carry three different types of gravlax ... OMG ... \\n\\nI only go there when I can afford it --- this is not a regular in\\ndulgence for me - but when I need something GOOD, this is where I go.  (Taro is another option but has less of a variety).  Like the owners - and its a good opportunity for me to practice my Korean!\\nWent back - gave Congee Wong another chance after our last somewhat disappointing experience.  This place is back on track.  OMG, amazing.  The jjeok they serve at this restaurant is amongst the best in Toronto.  Ordered the abalone and shredded chicken jjeok which was lean and did not have a fatty chicken taste (a pet peeve).  Ordered chow fun (BBQ pork) which was melt in your mouth caloric goodness.  Long line ups.  Well worth the wait.  Always busy.  Efficient table service.  Bring your own tea if you prefer a milder blend (spouse and I bring our own Chinese chrysanthemum tea which goes very well with the food).  I love this place.\\nI agree with Angel L\\'s review.  There is nothing that blew me away there either.  Things also looked as thought they\\'d been picked over 100 times.  The racks \\nare way too overstocked which means (a) you can\\'t see things perfectly (b) things keep falling off the rack(s).\\n\\nEven the spice/marinade section in the Home Sense area was a bit lacklustre.  I bought a box of Scottish shortbread which seemed like a good idea/deal at the time - except there was no discerneable taste of butter, i.e. lower end brand.\\nChowon - good champong (Korean-style Chinese food).  Kuksu very well done, al dente and the broth has a deep flavour.  Seafood always fresh.  Try and sit in front of the restaurant as many people order the table cook in the booths on the other side and the smoke can sometimes irritate.  Have had their yuk kae jang and the broth is a very good quality.  Parking outside.  Not fancy, but good, wholesome food.\\nDecided to give this place a go as it is closer than Golden Asian.  Hubby ran out to take out for us.\\n\\nManchow soup was more of an egg-drop/pea/carrot type soup with lashings of white pepper.  It was OK but not spectacular.\\n\\nThe Manchurian-\\nHakka noodles were OK, had a good bit of \"wok-hay\" but greasy as heck.\\n\\nThe Manchurian chicken was edible not the best I have ever had and appeared to have been breaded/deep fried.  I still prefer Bombay chicken with the wicked dry seasoning.\\n\\nIt seems as though they are altering the spice levels for the ... er ... local palate.  I wish the flavours had been bolder and more out there like what we\\'ve had at the other place.  Not terrible by any means, but OK.\\nMeh.  I have bagel in my DNA and this place didn\\'t do it for me.  They were ok but not awesome;  that borderline sweet taste of the dough does not do it for me.   The feta and cheese bourek was awful; embarrasingly bad.\\n\\nHave I had worse bagels?  Yes.  Were these great?  No.\\nEverything that is important to me in a restaurant, I found here (today). First off, a quiet, serene and peaceful restaurant.  Ahhh.  Clientele, quiet.  Music, classical, subdued and barely audible.  Service - fantastic.  Very attentive Adjuma who magically arr', 'actual_label': 13, 'predicted_label': 13}, {'text': 'ived with the ttukbegae of bubbling, rich, delicious goodness.  I had the kimchi soondufu (extra gochu) and Spouse had the hwae-mool (fish/seafood).  It was exquisite to die for incredible.  Not overly salty and MSG-laden.  Just solid, down to earth, natural, home made good food.  Tubu is made on the premises at the restaurant.  It does not get any fresher than that, folks!  Fluffy dolsot pap (stone pot steamed rice) and sufficient panchan.  Really good dining experience.  We happened to be in that part of the city for other reasons and stopped in -- and I am so glad we did.  Definitely a place to go back to.  It is always nice to have a pleasurable dining experience where the food is excellent and the noise level not in your face and obnoxious.\\nI have known the Adjumoni who owns this restaurant for almost 15 years.  I knew them when they ran the original Jung Soo Nae at Finch and Yonge.  Went there today - OMG --- food paradise.  Her food is prepared with care, truly fine Korean dinin\\ng - reminiscent of the places in the smaller towns in the country in Korea.  Her panchan is exquisite - the kosari namul with posot was divine.  The baechu and chongga kimchi was like my friend\\'s Halmoni makes it.  True flavour ... the yeolmu kimchi water was perfectly balanced - just the right amount of vinegar and red pepper flakes.  I had the fermented soy bean stew, spouse had the kimchi chigae.  I cannot say one bad thing about the meal.  It is a real drive for us to get there from Toronto, but oh, so very worth it.  Hanjongshik, for my Korean friends out there - true Korean dining, nothing fake about this place.  Go there with friends.  Their booths accommodate at least 6-8 people and its a nice opportunity to enjoy good food with friends in a lovely setting.  One of my all time favourite Korean restaurants in Toronto.  They have kept their standards over the years.\\nOK place.  Not a huge variety but they had taro buns which I have not seen for a long time.  No jean-dwae ;=(\\n\\nCust\\nard tarts looked good but I went for the bready stuff given the heat outside.\\n\\nNot terrible, not the best, just OK.\\nBoo on you, Roy Thomson Hall.  We bust our buns to get to shows on time (i.e. yesterday was yet another example), and you indulge people\\'s lateness and allow people in late.  This is rude and inconsiderate.  Also, the acoustics are really mediocre at best.  I could put up with that if you stood by your start times for shows.\\nI am very surprised at the comments regarding rude service.\\n\\nI have been coming here for almost 20 years and have never had any incidents with rude staff.\\n\\nIt is a small, family owned and operated restaurant.  I have travelled to Korea since 1999 and this place reminds me of the food I loved in Jeolla Province in S. Korea.\\n\\nThe quality of the food is excellent and prepared meticulously and with care.  At the end of the day, that\\'s what my dollar is buying.  And Ajossi is a hardworking, salt of the earth, decent human being.\\nThis place has remained con\\nsistent.  Went there this morning for jjeok and it was divine!  Like silk - smooth ... hot and not too salty.  The super bowl of seafood jjeok filled us up and started the day on a positive note - nothing like a hot bowl of jjeok to start the day - sooo satisfying.  The noodles here are very popular.  Next time I am trying the grouper and tofu dish ... love Congee Wong.  A colleague of mine recommended this place to me.  Excellent food provided in record time!!!\\nForget the budget when you visit this place.  We have been going here for decades.\\n\\nThe quality of the Middle-Eastern items are fantastic.  Home made LOKUM ... with fresh pistachios --- REAL ma\\'amoul from Jordan with pistachios ... \\n\\nIf you\\'re looking for quality olive oil soap, they have carried a brand from Syria for years - its not in fancy packaging but this is quality soap that is kind to your skin.  They even carry chocolates from S.A. which I remember from childhood.\\nI was amazed and really impressed with the Service I r\\neceived today at ServiceOntario.\\n\\nIt was busy, but the line moved - efficiently.  There were tons of people - the line went all the way out the door, but I was seen in about 17-20 minutes, to renew my health card.\\n\\nVery impressed.  Swift service for me.  Why?  Because I read over what I needed to bring and made sure I had everything with me.  It was a seamless experience.\\nI do love this place.\\n\\nBUT: come early or else you\\'ll be dealing with the Yuppies and old Yippies like me have no patience!\\n\\nIf you know where you need to go ... make a list  in advance, puchase, and leave.  Becomes very irritating after 9:00/9:30 a.m.  \\n\\nTo quote Peter M:  \"Jeers\"!!!!!!!!\\nUnder new ownership.  Champong was ok.  Missed a few important ingredients, i.e. no cloud ear mushroom, small pieces of cut up squid and some small clams.  Broth was ok, noodles well prepared.  But the actual champong was average (sorry to say).  Needed more texture and seafood.\\nDon\\'t except service with a smile, but who cares!

The goat curry gravy was thick ... good ...\\n\\nThe sweets - ladoos, pista barfis, jalebi-like sweets, coconut barfi ... my God, forget about the CALORIES in this place.  Always walk out full - and happy.\\nInteresting earlier review observing that its \"pushy\".  Hmmm.  Well, I don\\'t see it that way at all.  It is people going about their business purchasing their produce without dawdling in the aisles.  So there.  It is a nice place, I get my Korean mandu, and Japanese noodles and soya sauces at a fraction of the cost of the Korean store.  They have a good range of Chinese, S.E. Asian and N.E. Asian condiments as well.  The fish area did not particularly appeal to me.  Prefer Korean or Japanese markets for my fish.  For basic Korean, Japanese and\\n other S.E. or N.E. Asian products, this place has a good variety and the prices are good.  And if you are hungry, you can run into Congee Wong, Asian Legend or take out BBQ from He He Long in the same plaza.  There is a woman outside of the store making delicious Chinese pancakes, oil free, with chili sauce or hoisin filling and a cooked egg.  Pure deliciousness!\\nAm very glad I went back!  This place is back on track compared to our last visit - and we have been regulars ever since.\\n\\nTheir standards are good - there was a time when they slipped - but things are now the way they were (thankfully).  The congee was fantastic, the glutens and vegetable in a cast-iron hot pot - exquisite!  And the hot and sour soup very authentic with lashings of white pepper.  Also went when the restaurant wasn\\'t too busy (Christmas Day) and the chef was really generous with proportions.  Someone was having a corn soup which looked out of this world - which will be my next choice.  This is a regular, go-t\\no, warm and familiar place.  Nice.\\nWhat can I say about this place.  Food is consistent - I have always loved Punjabi food.  The service - just remember not to take anything personally!\\n\\nHowever, the lady who was keeping an eye on things and the man at the cash register were polite.\\n\\nThe masala dosa was thin, crispy, hardly any visible oil to speak of any very tasty.  The accompanying coconut sauce, eggplant curry and rasam soup were very good.  Not dripping in oil.\\n\\nI had the fish tikka.  FABULOUS.  Dry (which I like) and well-marinated.\\n\\nNow, the piece de resistance:  THE SWEET COUNTER IS OUT OF BOUNDS!  Lots of different barfi (coconut, caju, pista, and of course gulab jamuns) ... and jalebis ...\\n\\nHave not been there for a long time.  Service is the same (not with a  smile but the food very consistent).\\nA family member had round one of cataract surgery today.\\n\\nThis is truly a world-class medical establishment.  People from throughout the province were here today.\\n\\nKudos to Dr. Braga\\n Mele and the professional and personable staff, including the anaesthesiologist.  The best surgeons imaginable, for intricate eye issues requiring surgery.\\nMy God what has happened to you, Congee Wong?\\n\\nWe have been regulars for almost 20 years.  This was seriously disappointing.\\n\\n1.  Beef and rice dish - served COLD (well, not hot the way it should be), with mostly lumps of fat, hardly any meat; gross;\\n2.  Fish maw and crab soup - underseasoned, lacklustre.  Not like it used to be;\\n3.  Miserable waiter.  Didn\\'t see the usual wait staff who have always been nice.\\n\\nI am going to give them one more chance - after I forget about those hideous pieces of fat in the \"beef\" and rice dish.\\nLove this place as well, its got a really fancy interior and it is designed like a real cantina.  The food is also exceptional there.  But Bonito (reviewed earlier) seems to have more earthy and home style food.  Have never had a bad meal at either place.  I had the ceviche here once and it was divine!  FRE\\nSH, marinated with citrus and melt in your mouth to die for delicious.  The refried beans at the other Michoacan (Bonito) is better but this is still a fantastic place.  Don\\'t limit yourself in Vegas to eating only on the strip.  There are a ton of really great places to eat at.\\nI have been going to this place since before the current owners took over.  For those of you who have been to Korea and sampled the food in Jeolla-do, this is the place to go to.  I love the chonggukchang chigae and the crab (when in season) with gochuchang is exquisite.  The jongols are pretty good too.  Spouse and I order the mukenji (fermented kimchi stew).  Ahhh ... always perks me up when I am feeling under the weather.  NOT A FANCY PLACE but tried and true.  The owner is a very kind and hospitable restauranteur.  We talk and reminisce about Korea ... \\n\\nAnother popular dish there is the bulnakjongol (meat and squid) dish in a rich, garlicky red pepper broth.

Was delicious.  Had the abalone and chicken jjeok.  Spouse said he found the abalone salty but I loved it.  Chicken was shredded well and perfectly cooked/steamed.  Indulged and ordered some Chinese crullers to go with the jjeok which were crispy, not greasy and way too sinfully delicious. Also had an order of Singapore noodles which were not salty, not overcooked, bbq pork and shrimps perfectly seasoned.  Curry was not thrown in at the last minute like some places.  Onions nice and brown and caramelized.  Somewhat dour service but \"whatever\".  I will return for sure.  Their jjeok menu is extensive.  Also serve good quality (red) tea.  Think it MAY be pu-erh.  Their noodle options look enticing as well.  Thanks Jason for recommending this place!\\nThis place is the best you will ever have outside of Montreal.\\n\\nIt is real, it is schmaltzy and it is just plain good.\\n\\nServed to you with a side of \"schtick\", \\nyou know you are in the right place.\\n\\nNot diet food.  Two of Metro Toronto Polices\\' finest were in there - and generally cops know where the good food is.  The place has a diverse clientele and it ROCKS - the owner is a character.

Oh, my God this place is good.\\nI have never had any luck at this place.\\n\\nNever seems to be anyone in there (no surprise).\\n\\nHORRIBLE, passive-aggressive \"customer service\".  And they have no product.  If you are expecting to find a superior brand of COQ10 or anything other than regular drug-store crap, you\\'ll be disappointed.\\n\\nMy husband dragged me in there last week convinced they\\'d have a product.  Waste of time.  And I agree with Jonny below - if they don\\'t have what you\\'re looking for, its like \"get out of my store\" (they don\\'t say it - you feel it).  Thank God for OPTIONS!!!\\nRound two of hubby\\'s cataracts done! These\\n folks are pros.  There is something very reassuring about this place.  Highly competent and professional, personable and you know you\\'re in good hands.\\n\\nHubby now has 20/20 vision. Guess I will have to start using my BB cream more often.  LOL.\\nI would rather have a colonoscopy without anaesthesia, than ever having to return to this abominable place.\\n\\nSlim selection, dubious quality merchandise, rude, pushy clientele and for the most part, disinterested, detached staff.  Who can blame them?\\n\\nDecent enough service at Adidas, Pepper Palace and Lindt only.  This was a painful experience in total.  Cole Haan was a disgrace - not quality merchandise, lots of poorly constructed and old, tatty-looking items. Their signature has always been quality products at their retail stores which I love.  This entire Outlet Mall consisted of lots of overpriced, sub-par merchandise, for the most part.\\n\\nHorrible, pounding music and just an overall nasty vibe in this outdoor \\'mall\\'.\\nBefore I proceed, a disc\\nlaimer:  Exceptional food, five star quality.  Service, one (at the most).  We waited for 1.5 hours before we even received our appetizers.  By the time we received the meal, almost 2 hours had passed.  We ONLY received an acknowledgement of the exceedingly slow service when we raised it and we never even received our dessert, for which we paid, as we could not wait for another half an hour.  The waitress kept disappearing into the kitchen throughout the entire time we were waiting because she did not know how to deal with the situation and my husband had to knock on the kitchen door twice to find out what was going on - and he had to ask for a knife and fork (I had mine, he did not have his).  Bad kitchen organization.  This is a place where you would do best by ordering way, way in advance, by telephone, and ask them when its going to be ready, i.e. how long is it going to take.  The food is good and worth taking out.  But unless you have the entire afternoon to waste, go somewhere e\\nlse or take out from this place instead.  This appears to be more a catering-type establishment and/or take out but not conducive to dining in.  Before leaving the waitress said she\\'d \"give us a free dessert next time\".  Excuse me?  Free?  We already paid for it (but did not get it).\\n... must admit.  It surpassed what I expected.  Except there was a man doing repairs on the restaurant equipment (underneath the equipment) with the food exposed on top of the equipment.  Didn\\'t make me feel overly confident when the repair man in his work clothes brushed by the food (NOT HIS FAULT).  Anyway, I am just OCD so it must be me.\\n\\nHaving said that, the food was FRESH AND DELICIOUS.

Lack of any decent (edible) food, shopping is useless (only magazines and water) and an overall \"stark\" and unwelcoming look about the place.  I am comparing it to Incheon, Hong Kong International Airport and Kuala Lumpur Airport and trust me, Toronto Pearson is like 100 years behind the times.  The carousels are ridiculously undersized for the amount of luggage which come off international flights and half to three quarters of everyones\\' luggage ends up on the floor.  I take a deep breath every time I go in there and \"brace myself\".\\nThis place is a magnet for me. \\n\\nI have had some of the best BBQ pork in Hong Kong and this place comes pretty close.  No doubt the secret recipe for the actual sauce/seasoning, goes back a few hundred years or more.  The pork has the perfect ratio of fat to meat --- and it literally melts in your mouth.  You can choose a variety of BBQ pork products, in\\ncluding the most decadent pork of all time - suckling pig, crispy and fairly dry (in a good way) crackling.  They also have BBQ chicken, duck, duck feet and what appear to be pigs\\' ear which I love.\\n\\nThe taofu there is always good and I purchase a few blocks as well as gai-lan so I can convince myself I am partaking of a healthy meal.  This is my happy place.  Always busy, for good reason.  May Tong Ha Supreme BBQ be in existence for the remainder of my natural life.  Doje!!!!!\\nI know my Korean food. I have spent almost almost 2 decades shuttling between Korea and Canada.  I have eaten in holes in the wall and the poshest restaurants in Seoul.  This place did not blow me away.  Constructive criticism:\\n1.  Panchan - ridiculous. Kimchi tasted almost sweet (which was weird).  Pajon is not part of panchan - and was leathery, cold and greasy.  Potatoes?  Massively huge pieces of kkagdugi cut up in a hurry?  Kongnamul - ok, standard.  The only thing that stood out was acorn jelly (muk).\\n2.  \\nWang mandu - worth 3.75 stars, except they arrived cold.\\n3.  Hubby\\'s kalbi in a natto-flavoured soup (similar to dwenjang chigae) was allright, the broth good, but the meat tough.\\n4.  My seafood ttukbegae dish was satisfactory, not outstanding.\\n5.

It comes with a tangy sweet/sour clear broth. Spotless place and clean food.  Spouse had a pork chop with garlic rice - gorgeous.\\n\\nOf course we had our usual Goi cuon bo to start - mmmmmmm.\\n\\nI have to say that this is true, 100% Viet. food at its finest.  Nice staff - \\nquiet and low key place.  Highly recommend!\\nI know ... I keep reviewing the same places over again.  Why not?  If a place is tried and true, keep going with it.  Went there today and again ---exquisite.  The mamoul filled with dates was divine.  It was almost as good as the ones I used to make when I was young and had the energy to bake.  The taste of the rose water was subtle, but in the background, the semolina dough, just perfect.  Love this place.  They also have graibe (shortbread) but I resisted the temptation.

We got beef chow fun, mixed vegetables with garlic, breaded salt and pepper pork chops, and a tofu hot pot.  Yikes!  The table was full and there were only two of us.\\n\\nThe dishes were all very good.  My favorite was the hot pot.  The tofu is fried first and then put in the broth.  There were a couple of kinds of seafood in the hot pot and some chicken and pork.  There were also some beautiful mushrooms that held the heat from the burner below.  Be on guard to let the mushrooms cool a bit before eating.\\n\\nA couple \\nof things regarding service.  We were seated and our server was prompt at getting our order.  Since my friend is from Taiwan, she ordered in Chinese and I\\'m sure that helped our service.  \\n\\nAt the end of the meal, they brought us a complimentary warm mung bean dessert that was very tasty--not too sweet.  Our server also packaged up all the leftovers in take out boxes and I have enough in my refrigerator to feed half the Taiwanese army.  It will taste good as leftovers.\\n\\nOne stereotype I encountered was that one of the servers placed a fork and spoon with extra napkins at my plate but not at my friends.  I wanted to jab him with my chopsticks when he next went by, but I realize he was being helpful.\\nI decided to go and see Jennifer Lopez on one of her stays in Las Vegas.  I had no prior knowledge of her music but of course you must know who she is.\\n\\nI enjoyed the show.  The staging was dramatic and very well done.  As for Lopez herself, she certainly can belt out her songs.  I especiall\\ny enjoyed the couple of Latin numbers she does at the end.  It showcased her voice so much and I really liked the salsa beat.  Her dancing is very good also.  \\n\\nThe thing that surprised me the most is that she changes outfits almost as much as Cher does--well not quite that many times but there are a number of costume changes.\\n\\nI left the theatre pleased that I had gone to see the show.\\nI\\'ll leave my review at 3 stars for now.  This was my first visit to a Panera Bread to get sandwiches for dinner.  We needed a break from getting subs at different places and I chose to try something new.  This location opened recently.  It makes where I live about halfway between to Panera\\'s but I decided to try this one.\\n\\nService was great at the counter, but the wait seemed long for the take out until I realized they had a number of people eating in who had ordered just before I got there.  I brought the sandwiches home and they were very good.  My wife had their Cuban chicken panini and I had the si\\ngnature Steak and white cheddar.  They were both very good.  My panini had a fair kick from the horseradish spread on the sandwich.  With the sandwiches, I opted for the small bag of chips for each of us.\\n\\nThe order was packaged really nice in two small cardboard boxes.  My only complaint with this is there\\'s really no way to tell which sandwich is which unless you peel back some of the bread to reveal the contents.  Some places put a numbered sticker on their sandwiches to match the items on your receipt.  The boxes at Panera have a place you could write the name.  I sent a suggestion to HQ and the responded that they\\'d look into it.\\n\\nI\\'ll return and I think I\\'ll eat in.  The dining room is very nice and there\\'s outdoor seating for when it\\'s cooler.\\nThis has to be one of the best Starbucks in the area.  There is a lot of seating outdoors when the temperature warrants.  The indoor seating area is a bit larger than most, bit it\\'s the outside patio area where this Starbucks shines.\\n\\nThe ', 'actual_label': 14, 'predicted_label': 14}, {'text': 'staff here has always been very good.  The quantity of food on hand is ample to meet their high demand. \\n\\nIt\\'s a pleasure to come here.\\n\\nThere is no drive through.\\nOne of the two best places to go for ice cream/gelato in Las Vegas.  This newer spot on Las Vegas Boulevard near the Stratosphere is just wonderful.\\n\\nWe came here for a sweet treat and we weren\\'t disappointed.  I had the sweet corn and my wife had the pistachio gelato.  Both were very good.  There are several tables so you don\\'t have to go back to your car to enjoy your frozen treat!\\n\\nThe woman who owns the place is just a delight.  She is so friendly and she wants to have you try almost every flavor she makes. The shop is clean and bright and welcoming.  There is a bathroom and it was kept nicely clean.  In addition to the gelato, she serves some baked goods and coffee and tea.\\n\\nThe parking is the only potential drawback.  During the day, it\\'s probably more difficult to get a space here but I got one right in front of the s\\nexy clothing women\\'s store.  Viva Las Vegas!\\n\\nI\\'ll be back to try the chocolate gelato with two peppers to give it some heat with the cold.\\nThis is way out of the way for me, but I happened to be killing some time and I drove down Dean Martin Drive from Twain to Blue Diamond Highway.  Since I still had time left before I needed to pick up my \"fare,\" I stopped in here for gas.\\n\\nThe only problem I had wasn\\'t their fault.  The sun was so bright I couldn\\'t see the numbers displayed on the screen.  I ended up pulling to a pump int he shade and everything was OK from then on.\\nWe stopped for breakfast this morning after my wife\\'s blood work.  She was dying for her first coffee of the day, and that was the first thing we got.  Rich and tasty.\\n\\nFor our breakfasts, I had the lemon ricotta pancakes with sautéed apples.  The pancakes very light and they had just enough of lemon flavor with the ricotta so as not to be too lemony.  I used some syrup.  I think if I have this again, I might get the cr\\neam cheese icing they use with the red velvet pancakes.  it would be a nice combination.\\n\\nMy wife had a spinach omelette with cheddar cheese.  They offer hash browns or fruit and she got the fruit.  A very nice cup of fresh fruit.  They also give you a choice of toast or bagel.  Having a bagel instead of toast is not a common choice.  She opted for wheat toast.\\n\\nWe enjoyed everything very much.  Norm brought the orders to the table and chatted with us for awhile.  He asked for any suggestions, comments, or complaints.  They have instituted a comment card that\\'s brought with your check.  It\\'s optional, but if you fill it out, they stamp it for a discounted car wash at Fabulous Freddy\\'s - $3 off.\\n\\nService was the best.  There weren\\'t many people there, but they were very attentive.  I enjoyed my stop here, and I\\'ll be back.\\nWhat do you do after a four mile hike?  Try a new place for lunch with your hiking mates.  This is what landed us at Bob Taylor\\'s Ranch House late this morning.\\n\\nTwo \\nof us had the chicken wrap which in this case is fried chicken in a tortilla with lettuce, tomato, and ranch dressing.  It was very good!  The only change I\\'d make would be to use regular grilled chicken, not fried, but the fried did give the wrap a nice crunch.  It was served with steak fries.  The third person in our group had the tuna melt, also served with fries.  She was very pleased with her sandwich.\\n\\nFor dessert, we splurged.  We had passed on an appetizer to go for the good stuff at the end.  We opted for a slice of carrot cake (it\\'s huge!) with a scoop of ice cream.  The cake was excellent and it was the perfect sweet tooth ending to our lunch.\\n\\nService was terrific--perhaps because we were the only people in the restaurant.  I have a feeling that our server would have been almost as attentive if there had been 5 tables occupied.  The lunch prices are very reasonable.\\n\\nAfter all the years of seeing the signs for this place or seeing ads, I\\'m glad we gave it a try.  I have a f\\neeling that when we hike Mount Charleston and add lunch to our rigors, we\\'ll stop here again!\\nI have not been a fan of Fry\\'s in the past because I never found anyone who knew something about anything.  Questions were simply unanswered if you managed to flag down a floor person.\\n\\nI stopped in yesterday to waste some time and to look for another iPhone charger for the car.  Since my last visit a few years ago, it seems like they have done some training.  There were several sales staff around and I was even asked by one if they could help me.\\n\\nI bought my charger and some CD paper covers I needed to get.  A few extra points always for their checkout.  The wait is generally short with many positions open at once and a staff member to send you to the open positions.\\nDriving through DTLV a few weeks ago, I spied this new Starbucks and I made a mental note to stop here soon.  After serving at the Rescue Mission last night, four of us came to try out the new place.\\n\\nLocated at the corner of Cl', 'actual_label': 14, 'predicted_label': 6}, {'text': 'ark, and Casino Center Boulevard, you first see the different sign with lights.  Then you notice the modern design of the new outlet.\\n\\nThere are a couple of notable buildings nearby--city hall, the Regional Justice Center, and the Clark County Detention Center.  The good thing is the large amount of free parking.\\n\\nAfter taking a few photos outside, I moved in and ordered a venti black iced tea unsweetened.  The two baristas on duty were pleasant and I had my drink from Gabe in short order.\\n\\nI walked to the west side of the building and sat at a high top table to enjoy my tea.  My friends had other places to be so they went on their way after we said our goodbyes.\\n\\nI\\'m not often in DTLV but when I am I\\'ll stop here for my Starbucks.\\nWe came to Wo Fat after our Doughnut Crawl near UNLV.  There were five and a half of us--one was a three year old who didn\\'t eat all our goodies.\\n\\nNelson and Sylvia Q. had been here before, so they suggested some of the dishes that we ordered.  I can\\'t say t\\nhere was a loser in the bunch but I liked some better than others.\\n\\nThe spicy shrimp were good but they weren\\'t spicy.  There were some jalapeño slices on top but there was no  spiciness to the shrimp themselves.  The crispy Gau gee was a winner!  What great flavor in that fried goodness.  We mixed the Chinese mustard with soy and dipped the Gau gee in that.  Great!  The pressed Almond duck was another winner.  I love duck and this was great!  The Kow yuk - pork belly - was very good and was not as sweet as the look of the sauce suggested.  Putting a thick slab of the pork belly in a bao and eating was very tasty.\\n\\nI think this little restaurant is a place to which I\\'ll have to return.  Perhaps I can get my hiking group to stop here for lunch on the way back from one of our hikes this winter!\\nBúzios has been on my to try list for quite some time.  When I saw a Groupon for it, I bought one and planned to have dinner here on the night I was going to see Penn & Teller at the Rio.\\n\\nI had a\\n reservation for 6:30 and I was promptly seated in an almost empty restaurant.  There was one table occupied and one person eating at the seafood bar.  I had looked at the menu online, but I took some time looking there, changing my mind, and then ordering.  I was brought a bread basket, served water, and brought an iced tea quickly.\\n\\nI ordered a jumbo lump crabmeat cocktail, the miso Chilean sea bass, and the 7 layer chocolate cake for dessert.  The lump crabmeat was the best part of the meal.  The crab was tasty and the cocktail sauce they brought had extra horseradish to mix in.  I really enjoyed this appetizer.\\n\\nThe sea bass was disappointing.  It was on the menu under their \"House Signatures\" section of the menu.  It\\'s described as sea bass with a house made miso glaze.  What I got was more of a miso gravy than glaze and it wasn\\'t appealing.  When I tasted it, I wished I had ordered the plain sea bass.  The sea bass was moist and very hot (temperature).  The entrée comes with two \\nsides and I chose cole slaw and garlic fries.  The fires were good but they had absolutely no taste of garlic.  The cole slaw was OK.\\n\\nWhen it came to dessert, I had asked my server if the cobbler was warmed.  He said yes.  I asked him if it was already warm and he said no.  I ordered the cobbler and asked that it not be warmed.  About 3 minutes later, he came back and said they ran out of cobbler.  I opted for the 7 layer chocolate cake.  I wonder if they really were out or if the cobbler was indeed kept warm and he didn\\'t want to tell me that.\\n\\nService was spotty during the night.  Empty Sweet \\'n Low packets were not removed from the table until I put them in the empty crab cocktail glass.  Iced tea wasn\\'t refilled as quickly as many restaurants of lesser cost, and the table was not properly bussed.  The waiter didn\\'t remove the bread basket and bread plate before he brought the dessert.  After I had taken a few bites of the cake, a bus person came by and removed those items.\\n\\nAnd th\\nen there\\'s the Groupon.  The fine print says not valid with any other..... including Total Rewards.  That means, they don\\'t give you the TR pricing.  It\\'s not that much of a loss to the customer and it shouldn\\'t be that big of a deal for Búzios either.  $1 more for the appetizer, $3 more for the sea bass, and $1 more for dessert.  You got $5 more out of me for using a Groupon.  Was it worth it to you?  Also, the Groupon states that an 18% service fee (note they can\\'t say gratuity anymore because of IRS rules) will be applied to the bill prior to discount.  I somewhat understand this, but my server got cheated a bit because I normally do 20%.  Not that much difference but hey, I\\'m getting back part of the TR pricing I couldn\\'t have.  \\n\\nFinally, reservations were made through Open Table.  At any other restaurant, as soon as I check in, Open Table says I have 100 points.  As of this afternoon, my Open Table points are \"pending\".\\n\\nThis apparently is the way Búzios operates.  Don\\'t be busin', 'actual_label': 14, 'predicted_label': 14}, {'text': 'ess friendly with the customer.  Instead, challenge them and nickel and dime them every step of the way.  Groupons normally are sold by new companies to drive traffic and make a name.  The other reason is to help failing places.  Since the Búzios Groupon is an ongoing seller, I can only imagine that they\\'re struggling to stay alive.\\n\\nWhat a mistake it was to come here!\\nI am not experienced with BBQ so take that into account when you read this review.  I came here yesterday for take out.  I got two dinner combos--a Georgia chopped pork with the sides of Wilbur beans and garlic red skin mashed potatoes.  The other combo was a Texas beef brisket with sides of potato salad and Dave\\'s cheesy mac and cheese.  Both came with a corn  bread muffin.\\n\\nWe enjoyed the dinner, perhaps because it was a different kind of meal for us.  It was quick.  I didn\\'t call the order in but went there and ordered at their To Go section.  The wait was about 5 minutes.  Customer service was very good and I was soo\\nn on my way.\\n\\nThe only thing I regret is all the plastic used for take out.  Some recyclable, some not.  I think another time, I\\'d just go and eat there rather than bring home so much that will end in the landfill.\\n\\nI\\'ll be back but I need to try some of the other BBQ places in town including one recommended highly by Nelson Q.  He never steers me wrong.\\nThis was my second visit to the Las Vegas Farmer\\'s market at the Bruce Trent Park.  There were several vendors missing since my last visit - most notably - Bon Breads.  I guess with the heat of the summer, some of the vendors are staying away from this late afternoon/evening market and going to the new market at Tivoli Village.\\n\\nI\\'d give the Market 4 stars if it weren\\'t for the drop in vendors. The vendors there today had some nice things, but I was looking for bread.\\nI am a big Beatles fan and I\\'m a fan of Love.  The show is very well done.  This music is exceptional.  The remastering of the music adds so much.\\n\\nI first saw this show \\nin previews and there were changes made in the first months following the opening to tailor the show to fix some of the negatively received bits.  I think they\\'ve done that very well.  The one part that I thought was hysterical was not received well by early audiences.  I guess you had to have a sick sense of humor.\\n\\nThe acrobatics and dance movements of the crew is amazing!  I love the car, the telephone booths, and so many moments that I can\\'t name them all.\\n\\nIn all, I\\'ve seen the show three times, and I have been enthralled each time.  There isn\\'t much interaction with the audience before hand.  It seemed like that reached its height with Mystère and \"O\" and has been slowly left out of newer Cirque productions.\\n\\nIf you are a fan of good music and excellent acrobatics and dance, go see Love.  You won\\'t be disappointed!\\nI was surprised when I came to Honey Salt for the first time last night to find that they were having their 1st Anniversary special, a three course dinner for $29.99. \\n They had a burger special, too, but instead of the scallops I had planned to order, I went with the prix fixe anniversary menu.\\n\\nThe meal started with an amuse-bouche--a demi tasse size cup of their squash soup with toasted pumpkin seeds and pumpkin seed oil.  It was very tasty and it\\'s a draw to get me back to try more.\\n\\nI was brought the standard metal container with two slices of bread and two of lavash and some honey butter.  The breads were good.\\n\\nThe first course was a salad with pork belly.  The pork belly was cooked nicely and the greens had a tasty vinaigrette dressing.  There were red and yellow plum tomatoes in the salad.\\n\\nThe second course was ahi tuna.  It was seared perfect;y with a red interior.  The ahi was served on red and white quinoa and some of their house made salsa.  The seasoning of the quinoa and the ahi were excellent!\\n\\nFor dessert, the only course with a choice, I went with their butterscotch pudding.  It came in a glass jar and on the lid were some Cracker \\nJacks.  The lid was removed by the server and placed on the plate.  There was a layer of cookie crumb beneath the pudding and then some chocolate pudding below.  Great!\\n\\nService was as good as some of the top restaurants on the Strip.  I never had more than a few sips of my iced tea when the beverage person was at the table refilling my tea.  When I got coffee with dessert, he was back twice to refill my cup.  My server, Erik, was a pleasant, genial man and he made me feel welcome for my first visit to Honey Salt.  \\n\\nHappy 1st Anniversary Honey Salt.  I\\'m glad I finally got there!\\nI stop here periodically when I need something I forgot somewhere else or couldn\\'t find.  I find their prices to be high compared to other chains unless you happen to hit a sale for the item you want.\\n\\nThe store always seems a bit cluttered and even messy.  There is often stock in plastic boxes on the floor waiting to be shelved.  It\\'s just not a pleasant place.\\nApparently this Froots has closed.  There are n', 'actual_label': 14, 'predicted_label': 0}, {'text': 'o lights on when I go by, and the location is not listed on the company\\'s website.\\nI\\'ve been here two other times. Today was special as we had our \"doughnut crawl\" in the large room behind the coffee bar.\\n\\nThe two working the slow shop (it\\'s winter break at UNLV) were very polite and helpful.  I got my usual Black Forest Ice Blended and it was great!\\n\\nIt was quite good of the staff to let us have our Yelp meeting in their room!\\nI came here with two Yelp friends, Michael U. and Chris V., to try the restaurant\\'s new breakfast menu.  I was here opening night and wanted to make a return visit.  The new breakfast menu was a good reason to go.\\n\\nWe were seated promptly and was brought our coffee.  There was a question about the coffee they used and the server was a little flustered.  More on that later.  We were brought two cups of regular coffee.  We ordered four items that were to be brought as two separate courses.  That\\'s exactly what was done.\\n\\nWe started with the chicken fried bacon bis\\ncuits and gravy and the Dragon\\'s Breath chili cornbread Benedict.  The chicken fried bacon was nothing special except for the different take on the normal breakfast dish.  The biscuits were flavored perfectly and the pepper flavored gravy was good.  The cornbread of the Benedict was very soft and tasty.  For me, Dragon\\'s breath indicates a hot, spicy flavor.  While there was some heat, it was certainly no Dragon.  But that\\'s my taste buds.  I completely liked this dish.\\n\\nDuring our eating, the executive chef, Anthony Leitera, came to the table to respond to our question about the Stumptown coffee that had been asked of the server.  He couldn\\'t answer the question and said he\\'d send the beverage person to answer.  Before he left, he checked on how we were enjoying breakfast.\\n\\nThe server then brought out part 2 of our order, shortbread pancake and berry pot pie and maple bacon French toast.  I thoroughly enjoyed the pancake pot pie.  I agree with Chris V.\\'s comments about it falling apar\\nt easily.  The pancakes were very soft and the berry filling tended to make cutting and sharing a bit difficult.  I didn\\'t use any of the syrup with the pancake as I tend to eat them without syrups.  The maple bacon French toast was quite good.  Once again the bacon was the weak point.  The candied bacon was nothing special but I really liked the French toast and the brûléed banana slices.  Again, I used no syrup.  The French toast was very moist throughout although the ends were not cooked crisp.\\n\\nWith each dish we received a small glass of juice that was watermelon, orange, and grapefruit combination that was a nice palate cleanser.\\n\\nDuring our time there, the GM, Michael Speagle, stopped by to see how we were doing and thank us for our patronage.  \\n\\nEnough time had gone by that the lunch menu was now available so we decided to share one more dish--the S\\'mores Monte Cristo.  It\\'s a Monte Cristo made from brioche with a graham cracker butter and stuffed with marshmallow and chocolate \\nand served with chocolate and raspberry dipping sauces.  We used the sauces not for dipping but for pouring over.  This was a excellent!\\n\\nWe had a glitch with the splitting of checks the way we planned but that was rectified.  \\n\\nWhile I\\'m probably not going to be here often, I can see myself returning with a friends to split like we did today.  The process are Strip prices.  Note to Total Rewards members--$1 off each menu item with your TR card.\\nLast night was the third time I\\'ve made it to La Flor de Michoacan for some of their homemade ice cream.  I got two scoops in a cup, piñon (pine nut which is one of my favorites there) and a scoop of elote, ice cream made from corn.  She asked me what toppings I wanted, and I got a few spoons of coconut.\\n\\nThen it was outside time to sit on one of their benches and enjoy.  For a warm evening I was surprised I was the only customer for awhile.  This place is good.  Why can;t you be on the other side of town.  At least it\\'s not too far from the fr\\neeway!\\nI\\'m not a member here, but I took my neighbor shopping here.  It appears to be a nice enough discount warehouse store.  The only thing that really got me was that they had to take all four bags of 40 pound water softener salt out of our cart and move it to another.  It seems such a stupid waste of effort.\\nWe stopped here for an early dinner last night after an appointment.  It\\'s a typical Denny\\'s that caters to people of my age--gray hairs.  \\n\\nI had the Super Bird, a turkey sandwich with cheese and bacon.  It\\'s been a long time since I had one and it tasted very good.  My wife had an omelet and she was quite pleased with it.\\n\\nFor dessert I splurged and got their new Red Velvet Pancake Puppies Sundae.  Red Velvet dougnut holes with cream cheese frosting and vanilla ice cream.  Super!  Probably 1,000 calories in dessert alone.  :-)\\n\\nOur server, Travis, was excellent.  He was polite and very much on the ball with answering questions, taking the order, and refilling drinks.  I am a ', 'actual_label': 14, 'predicted_label': 14}, {'text': \"fan of this location!\\nAfter reading the good reviews on Yelp, I decided to give Pan Asian a try.  Wow!  Fantastic!  They have DUCK.  I had the duck curry.  It was a very large portion with crispy duck skin on the outside and juicy duck meat beneath that crispy skin.  Look at the photo I posted to see the size of the meal.  Fantastic!\\n\\nIt's a red curry with pineapple chunks, red and green bell pepper, some white grapes, some tomato chucks, and mint leaves.  I asked for a spiciness of 7 and I ended up putting some more spices on to give it the kind of kick I like.\\n\\nI so wanted to try the fried cheesecake for dessert but since I finished all the duck, I just didn't have room for dessert.\\n\\nAs stated by Ken, the husband and wife operate the restaurant with him being the server and her the cook.  They are delightful people who are very friendly.\\n\\nI'll be back often because they have DUCK along with a lot of other good things, I'm sure.  Next time--dessert!\\nI've done a lot of business with th\\nis store.  Last night, my iPod died and I needed a replacement.  A short drive later, I walked into a redesigned store and didn't know where anything was.  Then I noticed large signs with names on them and I just looked around the store from where I was standing until I found the MP3 sign.\\n\\nI walked over, look at the iPods, talked to one of their young associates, and shortly left with a new one.  At first, the redo made me feel almost lost, because I was so used to the layout of the store before this.  It is light and roomy, and I like the way it looks.\\nI needed a quick dinner with some leftovers.  I had been to this Sammy's for a Yelp event several years ago and decided to give it a go.  I phoned my order for an Italian sausage and a NY Style pizza.  The person on the phone told me it would be 10 to 15 minutes.  I immediately left and got there just as they were about to be removed from the oven.\\n\\nDuring the payment time, Beto, the man at the counter, asked how In was going to enjoy \\nthe pizza at home--with a beer?  When I said no, I would be having iced tea, he went to the counter and got me a take out container of their passion fruit iced tea to try compliments of Sammy's.  Nice touch.\\n\\nThe pizzas were good.  There's nothing special about them as far as gourmet topping but I wasn't looking for that.  This is OK standard, chain pizza, and it was a nice change from what I normally get.  And the leftovers make wonderful breakfast when you eat the slices cold out of the refrigerator with plenty of red pepper sprinkled on top!\\nReview is for casino only:  This place is OK.  It's a bit spread out, but it's easy to navigate when you know it's little quirks.  They did move my favorite VP machines but a check with one of the floor people let me know where they are.\\n\\nThe audio playing last night--notice I didn't use the word music--was simply awful.  Whoever programmed this must have been high or nuts or both.\\n\\nNot a bad place to play on the Strip.\\nI wanted to try this new \\nrestaurant before going to see Celine.  I arrived five minutes early and shortly the hostess on the first floor called an elevator for me and I went to the second floor where Mr. Chow is located.  A maître d' came out and introduced himself and said I would be seated shorty. The staff was going through its kung fu before starting service.  Check my photo for this definition of kung fu.  It has nothing to do with marshall arts.\\n\\nIn a minute or so, a familiar face appeared at the hostess stand--it was Mr. Chow.  He asked my name and the name of the woman who had arrived shortly after me.  He took the two of us into the restaurant and introduced us to the entire staff.  The staff then finished with a countdown after Mr. Chow asked them if they were going to give us the best service there was.  I'm paraphrasing.  I was taken to my seat and menus were placed and I was asked about water and drinks.  Tap and iced tea.  Standard for me.  It was about then that the kinetic sculpture descended a\\nnd starting going through its 5 minute show.  Quite interesting and innovative.\\n\\nMy server was a bit concerned about me dining alone as there plates are meant to be shared and maybe I should have a few apps and sort of do it like a taps place (my words).  That wasn't why I was there.  I studied the menu and picked out three items.  He had suggested a double order of chicken satay, but I decided on a single order--which consists of one satay--and I ordered the turnip puffs.  I also ordered the With Three dish.  It should be noted there is a $40 minimum charge per person.  Not to worry, this threshold is very easy to surpass.\\n\\nAfter my water and iced tea were brought, a runner came with Mr. Chow's homemade hot sauce.  Shortly, another runner brought the chicken satay and a very hot share plate with the Mr. Chow name on it.  The chicken satay was a bit disappointing.  The sauce on it didn't flavor it all that much and it was a standard chicken satay.\\n\\nMy second course was the turnip puffs\", 'actual_label': 14, 'predicted_label': 14}, {'text': \".  There were six in the order and the pastry was done nicely.  I did use some of the hot sauce with these and the hot sauce rescued the puffs from tasteless oblivion.  This made the experience so far at 0 for 2.\\n\\nThe main course was brought.  The With Three consists of prawns, chicken, calves liver and sea mushroom sautéed in wine (quoting from the menu).  The sea mushroom was outstanding!  I think there was one prawn with much chicken and some calves liver.  This was really a different dish and that's what struck me as I was looking through the menu.  Unless you eat like a super model--or maybe I eat too much--this was not a dish to be shared unless a couple is ordering several dishes and tasting a little of each.  For one person, it's not hard to render the plate empty.\\n\\nAfter the table was cleared, a woman came pushing the dessert trolley through.  Lychee, carrot cake, rummed oranges, I believe, a triple chocolate cake, and some others.  I got the triple chocolate cake and it was t\\nhe winner of the evening.\\n\\nService was excellent almost to the point of being overdone--patronizingly so.  Everyone is very pleasant.  They haven;'t had their grand  opening yet, I was told, and they'll have no problem with it.  This staff knows its stuff pretty well.  There were a few mistakes in the menu in my case but nothing terrible.\\n\\nSpending the amount I did, I would have hoped I left with more positive thoughts about the dining experience.  Instead, I'll remember three important words--Spring Mountain Road.\\nI was running errands today and I decided to stop here and experience what some of my friends have been talking about.  It really is a well done tea and coffee shop with pastries too.  \\n\\nI ordered berry black tea, iced and I got some macarons top bring home.  The gentleman asked if I wanted a stamp card and he spread the cards out so I could choose the one I wanted.  I wrote my name on it and hung it on the wall.  He then told me to sit anywhere and he'd bring the things to \\nme when they were ready.\\n\\nI sat at a low seat near two primary desks/seats from an old school.  It reminded me of the desks I'd seen for so many years as a teacher when I was in the elementary school.\\n\\nIn a short time, the gentleman brought me a tray with a pot of hot berry tea and a glass with ice.  He told me if I needed any more ice or hot water that I was just to ask.\\n\\nLater, he came back to ask if I needed any more hot water and I asked for some more ice.  The tea was very tasty.  Serving the tea in the small wooden tray with a leaf and wind up toy was really a nice touch.\\n\\nEdit:  While I was drinking my tea, the gentleman came over with the macarons I had ordered.  They were placed in two bags with a nice sticker closure.  They are very tasty.  I tried one--all right--I tried a couple.  The chocolate especially stands out.\\n\\nThe only drawback for me today was the fact I was there alone.  This is definitely a place where you want to come with a friend or friends--maybe even sit in \\nthe VW canvas bus.  It's a place where you share conversation, play a game, or enjoy a pastry with someone else.\\n\\nI really like the way the place is decorated.  So many nostalgic things.  Thanks to Paolo's girl friend and Brian for the translation of the name.  I'll be back to get my stamp card off the hook and I'll come with a friend.  I need to find someone who wants to share some honey toast.  It looks so good.  Almost enough for three people.\\nI met a friend from Canada for dinner at Ping Pang Pong tonight.  My only other dining experience here was with the same friend about 4 years ago.\\n\\nWe ordered three dishes to share:  The Singapore rice noodles were excellent.  There was a fair number of shrimp and some small slices of pork along with onions.  The curry flavor was good.  For my taste, I could have used a bit more.  We got an order of wrinkled green beans.  I don't think they were seared as much as they should have been to make them wrinkled.  They were crisp.  Their flavor was \\nvery good.  Finally, we got the half roasted Cantonese duck.  The flavor of the duck was a winner, too!  I'm not a big fan of duck when it's on the bone, but this was cooked well.  \\n\\nService was good.  My iced tea refilled often without asking.  We did have to ask a server to bring us some clean plates so we could get rid of some of the duck bones.  \\n\\nThe one drawback of Ping Pang Pong was the loudness of the place for the first 1/3 of the hour and a half we were there.  It was so noisy from people talking loudly and the kitchen staff, filling orders for take out and yelling the orders to each other.\\n\\nI do like the place and I will be back if only for the Singapore noodles.  That was my highlight of the meal!\\n\\nPS:  I love the name.  I can't help think of Puccini and Turandot!  Addio amore, addio razza....\\nI went to the Royal India Bistro for the lunch buffet today.  Lunch was very good and service was excellent. \\n\\nI was the first person here at about 11:30 but several tables were occup\", 'actual_label': 14, 'predicted_label': 14}, {'text': \"ied before I left.  The server asked me for my drink order.  I got tap water which.  She then said they had a buffet and I replied that was the reason I was there.  She gestured for me to go ahead and start and she'd get my naan.\\n\\nThe buffet is small by comparison to other Indian buffets in town.  There are 8 hot dishes, some salad, and achaar.  It was a good enough choice and the good taste of the food made up for the limited selection.\\n\\nThe naan was buttered generously and was a welcome addition to the meal.\\n\\nFor my first trip, I got chicken tikka masala, malai kofta, and some basmati rice.  The thing I noticed about all of their dishes was they all had a nice spicy flavor.  It's not overpowering for people who like mild food but it had a definite tang and it was not just one dish but all of them.  It was the first time I know that I had malai kofta and it was really a treat!  The last thing was the vegetable pakora.  This was a bit disappointing.  I didn't read the full description \\nbecause I know what it is.  The only vegetable I could see/taste was potato.  It seemed more like it was a pakora made from bread stuffing and some potato.\\n\\nFor the second plate, I had aloo matar, daal maharani, and curry chicken.  The aloo matar and curry chicken were good.  The daal was OK.  The sign said spicy lentils but this was the only dish that was lacking in spice.  There were some beans mixed in the daal, too.\\n\\nFor dessert I got some rice pudding and some carrot pudding.  The rice pudding was not labeled as kheer and it had a lot of liquid with less rice unlike kheer or rice puddings I've had before.  The carrot pudding, on the other hand, was very thick and unlike the carrot puddings I've had elsewhere.  Both puddings were very good--I'm not criticizing them but merely pointing out the different preparation.  I wish I had seen the achaar at the beginning of my meal.  I didn't think it would be as tasty with dessert!\\n\\nService as I said was very good.  When I went for my secon\\nd plate, my dirty plate was removed and my water glass refilled.  The server was very pleasant.  The room is quite nice and it was very quiet.  \\n\\nThe price is just over $16 including tax.  For the limited selection, it's higher than most places.  Also, you have to park and walk your way through the casino to get there and it's right in the middle, halfway between either garage.\\n\\nStill, I won't hesitate to stop here and I think I'll try it for dinner some evening.\\nI have driven by Rincon countless times and was amused by the name in big letters and below a small sign saying Italian deli.  It didn't seem to go together, but I get it now.  They have more than just Argentinian food but that's the highlight.  It's the corner storefront of this U shaped shopping plaza in Chinatown, hence the name.\\n\\nI came here with a friend for a late morning lunch and we ordered and shared many items from the menu.  We were brought some bread and chimichurri.  The spices in the chimichurri were very good an\\nd went well on the bread and some meat we had later on.\\n\\nWe started with an order of provoletta--grilled provolone cheese topped with chili and the chimichurri spices.  We took our knives and dug in and pulled up some cheese that hung like melted cheese will.  I put the cheese on my bread.  Vary tasty and great start.  We then got the order of three empanadas--one ham and cheese, one chicken, and one corn and cheese.  All three were good.  I liked the chicken the most.  The crust was flaky and thin.  The amount of filling for the three was perfect.\\n\\nThen came the main course--a Parrillada Argentina, a mixture of grilled meat.  Ours consisted of three sausages, sweet bread, skirt steak, and short ribs.  It was perfect for sharing.  We each had a length of short rib, one white sausage each, we shared the one black sausage (blood sausage or blood pudding are two names for it) and we each had a skirt steak.  We got all the meat cooked medium.  The skirt steak was a little tough but it was \\ntasty.  The chimichurri added to the meat.  The grilled meats were really very good.  My favorite here was the blood sausage.  It's the first time I've had it and it was quite good.\\n\\nThen we ordered four desserts to share--dulce de leche flan, an alfajor, a Mil Hojas, and a pasta frola.  While all four were excellent, I had two favorites here--the mil hojas and the alfajor.  I'd had an alfajor once before and it was good to have this sweet cookie once again and the mil hojas had a great filling of chocolate and the spice, which we couldn't quite place was cardamon our server told us.  The flan was very soft and the pasta frola--quince tart--was also quite good.  \\n\\nService was great!  Our server was a delightful young woman who answered questions and always had a pleasant smile.  She refilled our water glasses several times.\\n\\nA great meal with a good friend--that's what Saturdays are for--or any other day of the week ending in y.\\n*** Review is for casino and garage only***\\n\\nI went to th\", 'actual_label': 14, 'predicted_label': 14}, {'text': \"e Quad last night, November 22, to see the Headliners 2013 in the Q Theatre.  First, with the construction of the Big Wheel and Project Linq, finding a way in can be a challenge. Once I got to the garage, there was a large stream of water flowing through from just two days on light but continual rain.  Imagine if it had been a sudden thunderstorm.  This parking garage, aside from the constant flooding, is a joke.  Even on the first level up, there was a large amount of standing water.\\n\\nOnce I got into the casino, I saw that they have redone some of it quite nicely.  There is still a large sectioned off area where renovation continues as it changes from the Imperial Palace to the Quad.  There's nice new carpeting and new tile in the casino area.  \\n\\nThe showroom is the same as it always has been.  There are just some new signs with the new red lettering and fonts.\\n\\nWhile the place has been gussied up some, this is still not a casino that would be a destination for me.  For a show, I'll c\\nome here.  Other than that, no.\\nDr. Doubrava is my eye care specialist.  He is an excellent physician.  I have been here for several yearly exams, and I stop in more often than I should because I'm always doing something to break, damage, or otherwise inhibit the lifespan of my glasses.  This is usually a hiking induced problem.  The office has a registered optometrist, Melissa, and she is top notch.  She has come to my rescue on many occasions.\\n\\nIn short, Dr. Doubrava's office is a one stop place for my eye care.  I appreciate him and the staff and will continue to stop here.\\nI came here last night with about 20 people from Yelp as the first stop on Nelson's UYE Taco Trek and Cool Down #2.\\n\\nI got two tacos, one cabeza with a hand made corn tortilla; the other was lengua with flour tortilla.  After stopping at the toppings bar on the side of the wagon, I enjoyed these tacos a lot.  I like the sliced cucumbers and their spicy hot green salsa.  It was very good.  On the lengua, I put som\\ne pineapple which made the flavor of the tongue stand out.\\n\\nI think this would be a place to which I'll return and get some tacos to go.  I find that eating at food trucks is problematic because you don't have a place to sit nor a table.  Of course, I could have gotten one of my folding chairs we use for after hike Guinness Time but today's not the best time to think of that.\\n\\nThis is a good street taco place and I recommend it if you're on the west side of Las Vegas!\\nI'm conflicted about writing this review because I was going to give a lower rating.   I was so hungry after spending 3.5 hours volunteering at the aid station for the Viva Bike Vegas 2012 ride that I could have eaten a take out menu and thought it was good.\\n\\nThis was my first time here and I had researched Yelp reviews and their online menu.  I ordered from the take out window one order of chicken lettuce wraps and a large hot and sour soup.  The lettuce wraps were very good.  I am a salt lover, but the sauce made the wr\\naps salty even for me.  But, I still enjoyed them.\\n\\nThe hot and sour soup had a rich taste but I'm not used to having ground meat in hot and sour soup.  It's generally small slices of pork.  The texture was a bit of a turn off and I didn't think the soup was that spicy.\\n\\nMy biggest issue was service.  I realize I was a walk in at 4:30 on a Saturday evening.  There were four people in the restaurant at the time.  There were some take out orders to be made but there was never less than three cooks working behind the counter and before I got my meal, there were 5 total.  I probably waited 15 minutes.  I saw the one cook pick up and handful of rice sticks and toss it into the take out box--no gloves, no tongs--just bare hands.  Also, the soup was ladled into the take out container and just left on the metal shelf for 10 minutes while the other things were being prepared.\\n\\nWhen the counter critter brought my bag, she apologized for the long wait.  I watched this place as it was being built \\nand never stopped.  That's been about 10 years.  I guess I can wait again before I return.  The lettuce wraps saved the rating from being 2 stars.\\nThis show is quite enjoyable but there are some problems with it.  One of them is the story, or lack thereof.  There is a small story that moves the action from one song to another but doing over 20 songs in an hour and 25 minutes doesn't leave much time for a plot.  \\n\\nIf you go to the show expecting you'll hear the Beach Boys, you will and you won't.  Some of the songs, duets for example, don't come across as sounding like the Beach Boys but that's OK.  Just don't expect all the songs to be like the originals.\\n\\nI did like the projection of scenery onto the screens.  In the beginning I thought it was too busy, but after the opening, the videos added to the show.  My favorite scene was the one riding the ferris wheel on the pier.  It was a stunning visual!\\n\\nThe cast is a mixed bag.  In the beginning, I thought Brooke was a bit shrill but that\", 'actual_label': 14, 'predicted_label': 45}, {'text': ' changed as the show went along.  Some of Tanner\\'s singing is just weak.  I wish they hadn\\'t made the \"fat\" kid the nerd.  Why is that always done?\\n\\nI think the price of the show is also a negative.  I expect tickets may show up in half priced venues.  If not, the show won\\'t last long.  Last night\\'s attendance was awful.  Probably less than 25% of the house was occupied.  That can\\'t continue if the show is to survive.  Perhaps they have full houses on the weekend.\\n\\nIf you get a deal on tickets, I\\'d see the show.  I enjoyed it.  It\\'s not a show I\\'d go back and see again like I have with most shows on the Las Vegas Strip.\\n\\nOne final recommendation, if you go, get the cheaper tickets.  The theatre isn\\'t a huge one and you\\'ll be able to take in the graphics on the screen and see all the dancing and other things quite well.  I sat in the front row behind the VIP section, and I thought it was just too close at times.  I should add that I think the seats are the narrowest of any theatre I gen\\nerally attend in Las Vegas.\\nI stopped here as I do periodically to get some items on sale.  Smith\\'s had some items in their mailer that were very nicely priced--great loss leaders.\\n\\nWhile this isn\\'t the newest of stores, it\\'s clean and I am able to get in and out pretty quickly.  Therefore, it\\'s A-OK for me!\\nWe had a $40 Groupon for the restaurant and went last Saturday evening.  Our reservation was for 5:15 and we were right on time.  The place was almost empty at the time and we were shown to our table.\\n\\nThere is a Yelp check in offer for free bruschetta but you can\\'t double dip on the coupons--either the Yelp or the Groupon--so of course, we went with the Groupon.\\n\\nWe were brought iced teas and a bread basket shortly after being seated and ordering.  The bread basket was a let down.  The one piece of lavash was more like pressed cardboard and the two types of focaccia were merely OK.  We did not get butter but rather a mixture of olive oil and balsamic vinegar.  I have to remember i\\nn Italian restaurants to tell them to hold the balsamic.  It\\'s just to sweet for me.  Give me plain olive oil and a salt shaker.\\n\\nWe ordered fried artichoke for an appetizer.  It was very good.  The dipping sauce was quite good.  There were 6 pieces of artichoke.  For mains, we each ordered ravioli.  I got the Lobster stuffed ravioli with lobster sauce--a house special for the evening.  My wife got the ravioli stuffed with butternut squash.  We both enjoyed our ravioli.  The serving size was just right.\\n\\nFor dessert, I ordered a cannoli and my wife got the vanilla crème brulée.  Both were good.  The cannoli was fairly standard but I didn\\'t taste any of the pistachio nuts that were supposed to be in the cream.  The crème brulée was the winner of the two desserts.\\n\\nI think Gaetano\\'s is overpriced.  It only makes sense to go here when you have a coupon of some kind.  Service was good.  It was pointed out when the bill was brought that gratuity had automatically been added because of the G\\nroupon.  I\\'m not a fan of that.  Actually, the server lost because he got a lesser tip than he would have gotten had I made the decision and not the restaurant.  A good meal but a bit of a drive from Summerlin.  I can get equal or better Italian closer and for a better price.\\nMichael U. had the idea that after our Doughnut Crawl Part - II, we\\'d go to this new Po-Boy sandwich shop near downtown Las Vegas.  A caravan of five or six cars went form the northwest to Streetcar.\\n\\nThe owner helped move two extra tables to a booth and we had enough room for the 15 or so of us who descended on the place.\\n\\nFour of us decided to get one sandwich each and split the sandwiches into quarters so that we could each try a little bit of several sandwiches.  It was a super idea.  We ordered a Streetcar which has shrimp, oysters, and catfish.  Sandwich two was the Bourbon Street--roast beef with gravy.  The third sandwich was the Crescent City, a muffuletta.  The fourth was a Marie Laveau which is boudin s\\nausage.  We also had a Pirogue, a crawfish boudin because an error was made and they brought the wrong sandwich, but left it with us to enjoy while they made the correct one.  Most of the sandwiches came with chips and a small side of cole slaw.\\n\\nWith our sandwiches, we ordered three sides--deep fried macaroni and cheese, hush puppies, and corn fritters.  \\n\\nEverything was simply great!!  The bread is from the Leidenheimer Baking Company in New Orleans and is flown here for Streetcar.  The fillings in the sandwiches were excellent.  My favorite was Marie Laveua, the boudin sausage Po-boy.  The deep freind mac and cheese was excellent as were the corn fritters.\\n\\nFor dessert, they brought us some praline King Cake they were trying out.  It was very flavorful.  Michael U. had pre-ordered a King Cake and they were waiting for us to come before they dressed the cake so the icing and other things on top were fresh.  I have not yet tried my King Cake because I\\'m still in a food coma.\\n\\nService ', 'actual_label': 14, 'predicted_label': 14}, {'text': \"ork and beef.

As soon as you walk in you can smell the melting mozzarella.  Love that smell.  W grew up on Camp's and is almost in the cult, so we go to Camp's from time to time.  It has been a real long time since our last visit so it was fun to stop back in.  \\n\\nThe crust is a medium thickness, not to thin and not to thick, and somewhat crunchy.  One friend calls it almost like a biscuit, I really don't get that, but it is a little chewy and just a little brown around the edge.  One thing that I notice is they do not overload the pizza with sauce and toppings like some places.  Enjoyed our pizza and wil\\nl be back.  Have had the hoagie in the past and if I remember correctly, it is very good.\\nAs many have said, good Fro-Yo and organic options.  Service is helpful and friendly.  Can't believe I have not posted a review before this.  Anyway, great flavors.  Self serve.  \\nBut similar to many Fro-Yo places on the expensive side!\\nCoach's is your typical sports bar.  Lots of big screen TV's, very open area in stark black and white walls.  Just your typical sports bar menu with reasonable prices.  About ten beers on draft, looked like about the same number of beers by the bottle.  The Buffalo Chicken sandwich and sweet potato fries were good.   \\n\\nService was friendly.  Had a new waitress that did a good job but you could tell she was learning the operations and was getting info from the other waitress.\\nJust had a case of very good food envy.  \\n\\nRachel C., we had someone two tables over stand up and look at our orders...found he wanted to order one of the items we had and his better half made \\nhim change his order.  Our meals were excellent!  \\n\\nStarted with the Pear and Roasted Beet salad that include some of the best blue cheese crumbles and walnut vinaigette.  I had the pork tenderloin with a rub and raspberry chipotle glaze, chive whipped potatoes, grilled squash and some of the thinest onion rings with just a touch of breading (delicious rings).  The pork tenderloin was cooked perfectly, tender, juicy, and a great combination of flavors from the rub and the raspberry chipotle glaze.\\n\\nFor desert we share a blueberry cheesecake that we one of the better cheesecakes I have had in the area.\\n\\nOur server was wonderful, helpful and really just about perfect.  The menu references the local establishments that provide some of the dinner items including meat, veggies, bread, desert.\\n\\nMy one minor complaint is, it gets noisy.  Nice interior but mostly hard surfaces except one wall.   We were a walk in at about 7:30 on a Friday night and the Greeter asked for a few minutes and then \\nsaid he would have a table ready in about 5 minutes.  Was surprised to get in and boy was it worth it!\\n\\nSet up like a NYC type bistro.  \\n\\nWhat a great meal!\\nNew Venezuelan and Mexican restaurant opened in a location that had been Mexican and Pizza parlor before.   Have stopped by two times for a take out lunch and have really enjoyed my meal.  The Catira Arepa had seasoned chicken with some onion sweet pepper, some garlic flavor and some cheddar cheese.  There are two or three salsa options and I had a guasacaca which has avocados, some citrus, garlic and some chili peppers.  A very good and tasty arepa.  Also had a potosinas that were very good.   Nice to have this new restaurant with some Venezuelan items on the menu.\\nTasty pizza at a reasonable price.  What else could you ask for.   Thin crust with unlimited toppings for the topping freaks like me.\\nNice new DD.  Just opened.  Nice seating area.

The nice bar area, the interesting decorated dining and kitchen area and a nice patio to go along with the wonderful food.  The waitstaff is well trained but our servic\\ne was a little lacking for some reason.  Our server was good but would disappear and the others did help out.  We started with The Chicken LIver pate which was excellent, a great way to start our meal.  We shared a Bistro Salad that was very fresh.  I decided to have the NY Strip steak with the cognac pepper sauce (one of four sauces available)  My steak was perfectly cooked and delicious and came with a big batch of frites.  Was surprised the menu did not have any veal or duck on it too.   \\nWe were looking forward to ending our meal with the chocolate souffle for two and were not disappointed.

Cool place.  Nice to have some Spanish cuisine.  There are mostly highlights but a few minor things that I am sure will evolve since only open a week or so. \\nWe stopped in for a drink and some small plates. The bar is a stand up bar and limits orders from the menus of small plates, just what we wanted to try.  Morcilla cures meats in house so we decided to give them a try.  There is a small case of the many of the menu items on display at the end of bar.  The bar staff was good and friendly.  It was nice to be able to talk with the staff while they mixed sangria and some interesting drinks. We tasted a few of the wines available as a 2 oz. pour.  Not real familiar with some of the Spanish wines, so asked the bar staff for some info on a couple of the wines.  While they were helpful, I think a little\\n more info/description would be helpful.  One was compared to a french wine but did not get a real description.  I would think this will change over time, but a little more of a description would be helpful. One of the wines tasted was probably open overnight and seemed to be a little oxidized but was drinkable.  The others were quite good. We had a couple of the Montaditos (sandwiches), the  Matrimony was terrific, the beef tartare was good but it probably had just a little to much aiolo, The Cecina of cured dried beef  and the Morcilla sausage were both excellent.  \\n\\nThe menu includes some Jamon and seafood that we did not get to try, but will definitely come back to sample.  Will have to stop in with more time and have a dinner, too,\\nMy favorite brick oven pizza in the Burg and I have tried many of them.\\n\\nMet some other fiends with kids.  Kids hogged the comfy chairs and couches so we used a couple of tables.  Since a group we kind of shared, at least I did!\\n\\nHad a slice of the vodk\\na pizza, which is great.  Also had a slice of red pizza with roasted red peppers and pepperoni.  YUM!  Also, if you eat in, since they don't give it to you with the pizza (it comes with the take out), put some of the olive oil and spices and peppers in the little cup and use to dip your crust in.  Yum!  Also, shared a salad with the better half and it was very good with fresh ingredients and nice dressing.\\n\\nCity Oven now has wine and beer at reasonable price.

The Italian dressing was OK, nothing special.  Really liked the Ala Carbonara which is pasta topped with bacon, eggs, and Provolone cheese.  You get a big portion!  Though not mentioned on the menu, you can order a small portion but you do not get a side with that and the size is good for kids and most appetites.  Garlic bread comes with the meal and is good.  \\n\\nOur \\nwaitress did a real good job and the food did not take long.  The prices are very reasonable.  Good place to take the kids too.\\nStopped in on Saturday night.  Surprised to be able to get a table right away.  Our waitress was great.  Answered questions, first drinks came fast, refills when needed, waited for us to make our decisions on the burgher we would order.  Really enjoy the burghers, a nice combo of meat.  My classic burger was cooked perfectly and the grilled cheddar cheese pancake really added some great flavor.  Just the right place when you want a big juicy burgher.\\nHad a big fat Greek Gyro.  It was a big fat good greek gyro with the typical yogurty sauce, tomato, onion and lettuce.  New location.  Not crowded, staff was very nice.  Put PIta on the grill, once warm made the big fat Greek Gyro.  Had a spanakopita also.

Surprised about the late opening.  Wanted breakfast but could not wait for the opening time so moved on.  \\nStop for lunch recently and was very happy with my Rueben and fries.  I ate in and my Rueben and fries were very hot and very good.  My fries were crisp and tasty but by the time I was finished my fries had cooled off and were not quit as good, so if you take out the fries probably need to be nuked to warm up.\\nIt does get a crowd just after noon so there was a little wait but they then added a second person to\\n take orders and the line to order moved fast.  The prices were very reasonable too.\\nHey! You wanna meatball?  Good meatballs and pizza.  This use to be Franco\\'s Pizzeria Italiana but the owner changed the name to his name but still has the same good food.  Stopped by and had a meatball and small pizza.  good taste and good cheese on the pizza.\\nThe Cathedral of Learning...The Nationality Rooms.\\n\\nReally a must see for those interested in architecture and art.  The rooms are designed and decorated in traditional styles for the nationality they are named after.  Some great intricate work and design.   The Cathedral\\'s first floor is awesome with the Gothic  architecture.  \\n\\nAround the Christmas holidays they have tours and usually the first weekend in Decmeber they have an open house that include Holiday decorated rooms, traditional Holiday traditions, feasting on ethnic foods, craft demos and guides to the 27 rooms.  \\n\\nTaped tours are available the rest of the year.  Another fun place to \\ntake visitors.  If you would like to learn more just Google University of Pittsburgh Nationality Rooms.\\nWas in a hurry and the line was short so decided to give WoL another try.  I guess I should have tried something else.  The Chicken and Cilantro Dumplings were good. The Spicy Chicken Fried Rice was not.  Should have just moved on.\\nMmmm! Not sure what to say.  Ordered the Lamb Choolaah.  When about half way thru found a small piece of plastic wrap (see picture).  Kind of took the edge off a meal that was pretty good.  Actually finalized my eating.  \\nAbout half the tables were empty but most were not cleaned/wiped off.  Our table had a lot of crumbs on it as did a few others we looked at, took the cleanest table.\\nWow, nice chocolate smell as you step in the door.\\nFront of store has lots of candies and treats.\\nLove the old soda fountain bar in the back; nice decor.\\n\\nFlavor combinations of 55 milkshakes, now that is the way to do it!\\n\\nPina colada shake was rich and tasty.

Rita's is the place.\\n\\nDid not realize that on the first day of spring all Rita's nationally give away the Italian ice...went in early evening and they were out of some flavors but man oh man was the raspberry wonderful!\\nStopped by for lunch.  Service was fast and good. The Manager stopped by to talk and see how everything was.  Nice atmosphere.  Basically one large room with a bar off to the side.  Had the Ricotta Gnocchi that has short rib and calabrian chili.  Very tasty with some spice.  Really a good stop for lunch.\\nThumbs up for the drive thru.  This location is at the corner of McMurray Rd and a little hard to get into and only a right turn to get out.  But hooray for the drive thru!  Stopped to get my usual morning breakfast when I am in rush and didn't eat better at home.  A good grain bagel with some cream cheese shmear.  Love the green iced tea!.\\nNice de\\ncor.  Good prompt service.  Had a crab salad wrap that came with crisp french fries and a couple of fresh strawberries.  Enjoyed the crab wrap.\\nGreat new fast-casual that is open for breakfast or lunch!   Great addition to downtown for lunch!\\n\\nFresh Fire-Roasted Flatbread Pizza, panini sandwiches, soup and salad.  \\nPizza with a purpose!   \\n\\nHave been to the other location and now to this location.  Delicious Flatbread Pizza, salads, breakfast panini and Wood-fired wings.  You can be creative and create your own pizza or sandwich.  Had the Capocollo flatbread sandwich with lettuce tomato cheese and fire roasted onions and the dry-rubbed wings.  Delicious!\\nSlice.  With all the hype from the owner or his friends, decided to try it after reading the website...also easy to get to because it is close to home.\\n\\nCalled and ordered take out.  \\n\\nFresh ingredients and good sauce.  Enjoyed the sauce and toppings.\\n\\nCrust is thinner crust and crunchy.\\n\\nPeople behind the counter were very friendly an\\nd helpful.\\n\\nHave a few tables on the sidewalk so you can watch the cars and T go by.\\n\\nYou can order pizza by the slice.\\n\\nVery enjoyable pizza and was surprised at the price of our pizza...it was a little lower than other places.\\nGood place to meet some friends.  We had a large group meet at Duke's to have a little holiday cheer.  Service was good considering how crowded it was.   The bar was overwhelmed by our group and another group.  We had some pizza and wings.  The pizza had a medium crust and was good.  The wings were somewhat crispy and tasted good.\\nStill not meatball's.  Service is friendly and did not take very long to get our meal.\\n\\nThe pizza is OK.  The crust was a little thicker than last time.  Just a reminder, the cheese is cooked on top of the toppings.\\n\\nHad the chicken wings and they are OK.\\nLooking for something to do.  Check out Venture outdoors.  They have lots of fun activities from snowshoe training, hiking, cross country skiing in the winter to kayaking in the summ\\ner.  \\n\\nThey have family type activities and even some hikes and beer tastings.\\n\\nGreat way to get active and meet other people.\\nYes!!!!!!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGreat service!\\nGreat Food!\\nLove the BYOB!!! ($5).\\nReturned to the scene of the crime...Oh Yeah...Guess not!  They moved.  Thought LC would have a little bigger place.  Guess not!  Not Really!  Went late for LC since they close at 8, went about 7:15... all tables were full but you order at the counter, they give you a number and wait for a table.  Was able to get a table before the food arrived, which actually took about 15 minutes.  Very noisy.\\n\\nTook a bottle of wine, if you want wine glasses take your own.  Several tables had wine.  Mostly families or young couples.  If your a group...forgetableit..to crowded.  Two groups of about 8 came after us and left.\\n\\nNow to the food... Oh it is very good and not ur usual, this is high quality Mex.\\nIt is well established that it is a funky industrial cool decor and interesting cuisine.  It is dark with load\\n music playing.  Great service.  Our waiter was outstanding. \\n\\nSome interesting drinks and a fun bartender.  I had the red sangria with lots of fresh fruit. Better than my own.  SWMBO had a margarita and was truly satisfied.\\n\\nWe started with a build your own guac that had some bacon and blue cheese and a few other items.  Really good, the blue cheese worked well with the sweet guac and the bacon!  Really good chips too!    \\nWe spit our taco orders since you get 2 tacos. The Mushroom with garlic aioli and truffle salsa with brussel sprouts was the better of the two and very good.  The Korean with wagyu short rib, peanuts, napa cabbage and cilantro was OK.  The cilantro and seasoning gave it a nice flavor and a little heat but some of the short rib was over grilled/charred to a crisp. Unfortunately due to the over grilling some of the meat was tasteless and hard to eat. Will definitely go back some time to try some other items on the menu.  The price of the meal and drinks seems to follo\", 'actual_label': 15, 'predicted_label': 15}, {'text': 'w a local trend, where probably a little pricey for what you get, but still overall a good meal and good place to enjoy the cuisine.\\nStopped in for dinner on Tuesday.  Wings are the special of the day $.30. So we tried a couple of wings.  We started with some homemade soup, Bean and ham, that was very good.  Then had some Hot Garlic Parm and some Honey Jalapeño.  Both were good, but we like the Hot Garlic Parm better.  Thought the Honey Jalapeño were a little to sweet.  \\nThe wait staff was super friendly and gave us a sample of the soup prior to ordering.  \\nThe have a list of the specials that don\\'t seem to change, $30 wings on Tuesday, Monday there is another special and there is Karaoke and Trivia nights.  Would like to come back in the warmer weather and try out the deck.\\nExcellent Thai.  \\n\\nJust opened this week so not real crowded, but it will be.\\n\\nStarted with some soup with scallions and rice, very good.  Ordered the Green Curry which is a curry paste with coconut milk, eggplant,\\n bamboo shoots yellow peppers, and order it with shrimp (other options are pork, chicken, veggie..probably more).  All very fresh, tasty, cooked perfectly and delicious!   Spice is rated from 3 to 10.  Had it 6 (my usual) and it was very spicy and flavorful.  A ten must be unbelievable.\\n\\nThe restaurant is small with a minimalist decor but nice.  \\n\\nThe Chef, Penny, came out to greet the tables.  She gets most of the produce from the local markets and only cooks the food to order, so no precooked items.  Also, it is BYOB.\\n\\nFor those that live downtown or in the Strip,  you have a new place U can walk to!\\nGood tacos at a good price, $5.00 + tax for two.   \\nFresh ingredients and about 6 different salsa\\'s that are labeled ( a real +).\\nHad the carne asada, the chunks of meat were tough and overcooked, probably not a good choice since steak tacos at most places are tough and overcooked.  Also, had the carnitas taco which was very good, a much better choice.  \\nEdgar seems to have some specials\\n for the day but found the day I was there that the menu only had 4 taco meat choices and would prefer a another option.  There is the option for Tostadas, burritos and a few other Mexican selections.\\n\\nCash only.\\nGreat place for after dinner drink!  Service was excellent!\\n\\nUpstairs bar was nice place to relax and have a good drink or nice glass of wine.\\n\\nHad some brick oven pizza and wings and they were great!\\nNice big fat dog with some interesting selections.  Ordered a \"Signature Frank\" - BLT which was very good, with bacon, mixed greens, tomato and chipotle ranch.  The \"Frank \" was very good and enjoyed the toppings.  The menu also has a few salads, a few poutines and other sides.  We shared a Quebecoise Poutine that was OK, the fries were good but the gravy was a little cold and just not as good as I was expecting.\\n\\nWe did not have any beer, but there were a list of 9 beers on tap.\\nEdgar\\'s has dropped in where the Calif. Taco Shop was.  Stopped in today and the Manager greeted us. \\n He said they have been open 4 weeks.  \\n\\nThe decor has not changed but the menu and owner have. \\n\\nThe menu is Mexico City style food.  We were seated and given a menu.  The Manager took our order.  Someone from the kitchen delivered our food.\\n\\nThere was some chips and salsa samples at the counter that we were told to take a sample.   There were 6 different salsas that they sell to take home, too.  All the salsas are made at the restaurant with fresh ingredients.  \\n\\nThe menu has Burritos, Tacos, Tostada, some Mexican sandwiches, some entrees and Combo\\'s.   There was a daily special.  The burritos start at $9 and are large.  I had a Barbacoa..Lamb.  The Manager was happy to explain the menu, said the lamb was very good and popular in Mexico.  It come with beans, rice, cilantro, lettuce, tomato, cheese and sour cream.  A side salsa choice of medium or spicy is given to you to go with the meal.  The burrito was very good!  Better than the burrito I had when this was the Calif. Taco Shop.  \\n\\n\\nDrinks consist of Mexican pop/soda some homemade aqua fresca and the menu said ice tea..but none available when it was ordered. \\n\\nA TV had ESPN deportes on but the sound was muted.\\n\\n Here\\'s to your success...Edgar!\\nReally nice decor with the windows open to the covered patio tonight.  \\nA great night to dine under the stars.  \\nThe place was busy with 8 fish selections, 4 shell fish from the Meditareannean or North Atlantic.  There is also some lamb on the menu.\\nthe drink and wine menu is extensive with wine from many countries that are not usually on a restaurant menu.\\nOur waitress was helpful with the menu and wine selection.  We had a white wine from Greece that was balance with a little more acid that went well with our selections.  \\nWe stopped by later, after a an evening meeting to just sample some apps. and have a glass of wine.  \\nThe Shrimp Saganaki that I chose was very good with nicely cooked shrimp that was plumb and tasty.  \\nPoros has the potential to be a fun go to spot in', 'actual_label': 15, 'predicted_label': 15}, {'text': ' the Burgh.\\nCheers!\\n\\nGreat music, great music director.  They take chances and do some of the all time favorites.  \\n\\nLucky to have such a well respected orchestra in Pittsburgh.\\n\\nEveryone should try to find a concert they like and go at least once a year!   Some of the Pops series and guests are so much fun.  Even the kids like it.\\nService was excellent.  Waitress was top notch.  Able to answer questions.   Folded our napkins when someone went to see some friends or the bathroom.   Another helped with the great wine list.  Hard to get service like this.  The place was full, so surprised how excellent the service was. \\n\\nThe caesar salad was one of the best I have had with fresh parmesan, anchovies fresh romaine.  The crab cakes were cooked perfectly and very tasty with a pistachio and apricot crumb.\\nNice assortment of road, mountain, hybrid, and kids bikes.  Stopped in for a small issue with my bike and fixed it in a few minutes.\\nGreat Mexican food cooked up my Mexicans.  Had the Choriz\\no Tacos.  Wonderful taste and texture.  Small space but moving to Southpointe in January 2011.  Great lunch or dinner.  Very friendly staff.\\nNice atmosphere with about half the tables being large hightop for larger groups or sharing.  Like the couches in front of the fireplace. To bad the fireplace was not on.  \\nWe started with wine since that is suppose to be one of the draws of E&H. There are 10 house wines, 7 sparking wines by the glass or bottle.  Then there are the climate controlled red (8), whites (7) and bottles (6).  The 8 red and 7 white climate controled are offered in 1oz, 3oz, 6oz, or bottle.  Decided to try a couple of wines but found the prices way high, way high.  You can get a 6oz pour of the TB Primitivo for more than a bottle price at the state store (some of the others wines they have available are similar in pricing).  There is a happy hour pricing that lowers the 6oz pour but none of the others pours are lower.  We learned that on Wednesday you can get a pizza and\\n house bottle for $30, so maybe go on a Wednesday.  While I enjoyed the wines I tried I found they tend to have wines that are more on the very fruity and plum side and with not as much balance and tannin.  One wine I had was the Mollydooker Merlot and it was enjoyable but a tad fruity to go with the pizza I had.  \\nThe food was very good.  We started with the Beets & Bleu salad that was very good.  It has grilled golden beets with lots of greens, candied pecans and a nice viaigrette.   Our pizza choice was the Chicken Spinach Artichoke pizza that had mozzarella, pesto cream and a touch of smoked chili.  Our meal was very enjoyable.\\nService was friendly but they were overwhelmed.  Not sure why they seemed to be understaffed.  The waitstaff was working hard but had to many tables to cover.  Think they only had two waitresses and the all the tables were full. The kitchen staff helped out bringing out the food.  We did ask for some different wines for our second glass and it took a really \\nlong time to get our second glass, as well as our first glass.  Also, we were asked if we would like some parmesan and pepper flakes for our pizza, which we accepted and they never came.\\nJust a great meal all around!  Great atmosphere, too.\\nThe appetizers were sooo goood!\\nThe Tuna special was outstanding!  One of the best Tuna\\'s I have ever eaten.\\nFun place for the family before the Pitt BB game.\\n\\nJust love eating at The Porch.\\nHibachi Food Truck.  What a nice change of pace.  The Chef was busy inside on the grill.  The window person was very nice and very busy.  Don\\'t forget your number.  It was a busy lunch and a few people forgot the number they were told but the gal in the window was very nice and figured it out for them.  \\nThe Shrimp with veggies and white rice was very good and a good sized portion.  The fried rice looked good and was $2 more.  \\nIf you are in the mood for Hibachi and Hoshi truck is nearby, be sure to give it a try.\\nHad a smorgasboard of items since we ordered lot\\ns of stuff to stuff our faces.  \\n\\nThe Dynamo hoagie is steak and cheese with lots of fixings was dynamite!  The Italian hoagie was fun to eat with some pepper in some of the meat and not as sloppy as my fav.  The pizza is very good with a thin soft crust with a nice sauce with just enough spices.\\nStopped by for a quick lunch because I liked the place that use to be in this location.  This location has been a couple of pizza shops and a hot dog shop in between.  \\nAnyway, there are specials going on for the opening.  We had a pizza with pepperoni.  The crust is medium in thickness and was well cooked and a little crunchy.  The sauce and cheese were good.  The people in the shop were very friendly.\\nHave visited twice in the last couple of weeks.\\nFirst visit was for lunch and sat at the counter.  It was rather noisy but not to bad since I was by myself.  My waitress gave me good service but did not say anything and was busy.  The manager/owner did stop for a quick, \"How is everything\".  My', 'actual_label': 15, 'predicted_label': 15}, {'text': ' Greek chicken panini was dried out tasteless chicken, a surprise since this place seems to get such good reviews.  The fries and cole slaw that came with are what you would expect.\\n\\nWe decided to give it a try for breakfast.  We were expecting a wait and the hostess said 10 to 12 minutes.  We were surprised by her estimate.  Well 45 minutes later we were called and seated.  \\nThe place is so noisy we had a hard time talking/hearing each other.  Our waitress leaned way over the table to talk with us.  Did I mention it is way to noisy/load.  Our waitress was good and provided refills.\\nI had the blueberry pancakes.  The fresh blueberries were good, the pancakes were large but just OK not sure how to describe but just OK, not as good as a couple of other little diners we usually go to.  Also, a little more expensive.  Others had the french toast and bacon and were happy with their meal.  I did get a couple pieces of their bacon because they received so many pieces -- and the bacon was real\\nly good, thick and cooked perfectly.  \\n\\nPortions are large.  Service is good.  Food is OK, but nothing exceptional.\\nDid I mention Very Noisy!\\nAwesome to have a french bakery in the neighborhood!  If your are someone who likes to eat French pastries and bread, LaG is great. I love almond croissant and LaG\\'s didn\\'t disappoint.  It has been hard to find a great croissant since return from NYC years ago, and now have the place to go.  The Lunette was excellent, too.\\nHave been a fan for years.  Have not been to  PghTT for a long time and was able to stop by recently.  Remember when he was at the \"late\" Pittsburgh Market and the Coffee Buddha  and few other places.  Has been hard to track down recently.   Anyway, stopped talked with James and had a few laughs along with some top notch tacos.  $4 each or 3 for $10, so bring a friend and get 3 or eat to much.  The Jerk Chicken and the Maple Pork we both very good and the Jerk Chicken definitely had a little heat.  The taco shell is the double \\nsoft corn similar to the shells that most of the top taco stands use.  The toppings are usually fresh and add some nice flavors.  So if you are in the area that the PghTT has set up stop by and enjoy!\\nNice little place for a drink and some pretty good food.  The bar has a pinball machine in the corner, my memory may be incorrect but I think it was a Ghostbuster machine.  Did not play it. A comfortable dining area that was not real busy when we were there.  Started with the Ripe Tomato crostini that was very tasty with brie and a balsamic glaze.  I questioned, before ordering, if the tomato was ripe and not greenhouse tasting.  Our waitress assured me that it was ripe and tasty, she was not wrong, very good tomato along with tasty cheese and a wonderful balsamic glaze.  For the main course I had the Cricket-Chorizo taco.  The taco was OK but really lacked much flavor except for the cilantro, maybe I was expecting more.\\nDid you say Brunch.  Want a good Brunch.  Brunch, Brunch, Brunch.  A\\n top notch Brunch.  The food selection is really nice and somewhat different/adventurous.  How about Gravy Tots; Corned Beef Gravy... Oh so good...great corned beef flavor.  Smoked Salmon Pot Stickers..Yes!  Boston Cream Beignets...Yum!\\n\\nEggs Benedict, English Muffin with Crab Cake, Ham & Spinach was delicious. The Managed to get a bit of the Shrimp Frittata with spinach, roasted red peppers, grilled asparagus and balsamic reduction..Yum!\\n\\nWow was not expecting such good food.  Our server was top notch too.\\nAs others have stated, Lot\\'s of beer.  Ordered the Margherita pizza.  Was expecting a little one person pizza and received a large 8 slice pie.  The pizza had a little to much mozzarella for my tastes. could have used s little more basil, the tomato came in some big pieces and probably could use a little seasoning.\\nIf you like good dogs, this is the place.  The have gourmet dogs in natural casing on Boston style buns.   Have a Pittsburgh dog, Buffalo, New York and a few others.  The\\n Chicago Imposter is very good with banana pepper, celery salt, pickle spear and small tomato slices.  Have salads and fruit shakes.\\nOh Man Is This Food Good!   Stopped by to get take out since in a hurry.  Order from the chalk boards at the counter.  A bunch of specials on the special board.  The Lamb Gyro was a special and it was one of the best tasting gyros I have ever had.  The only nit is that a couple of bites of the meat were very hard to chew.  It came with some delicious homemade chips and a (I think homemade) pickle.  We also had some of the dry-rub wings which were tremendous.  There are some other wing flavors but the dry-rub were great.  \\nThe board said it was BYOB.\\nHave seen WoL at a few places and always seem to have a line so decided to try it today.  Had a combo of Chicken and Cilantro Dumplings which were very good.  The main course was Spicy Chicken Fried Rice and was not spicy and really below average.

Always liked the food and service was impeccable!   Well it hasn't changed!\\n\\nThe maitre'd showed our small group to a great table in the corner.  Yes!, what a great view!  Had reservations for a friends birthday...special occasion.  Fun to watch boats on the river, the incline and planes flying over the Northside..oh excuse me, it is now the North Shore.  We did go mid-week so it was not crowded.\\n\\nWe had a few kids, ages 11 to 14, and the maitre'd and server were so good a\\nt making sure they could order just about anything they wanted.  They had a long list of ideas not on the menu, since everything is made to order.  Fantastic!  Server went way above and beyond, like you would expect at a top notch restaurant.\\n\\nThe tables were so sweet!  Shiny table ware and glasses.  Fancy plates and linens, it is nice to dine out.  We ordered some Champagne to start off and waiter made sure to ask about the type we preferred, Brut, Asti or semi???  Great job!\\n\\nServer also suggested we not over order apps, and extras and told us about the roasted tomato that came with our meal.  Started with a couple of apps, escargot alio was so nice with garlic, not seen much anymore but fun to see the kids try!  The crepes fontinia were delicious.\\n\\nHad a classic, the Lemont salad, nice fresh greens served with the Lemont vinaigrete, really enjoyable.  \\n\\nThe meal came with assorted fresh bread and was refilled when needed.\\n\\nHad the Veal loin rib chop for two that was cooked perfectly\\n, tender and sweet.  Others had the salmon, New York Strip steak and a special kids spaghetti. Everyone loved their meals and how they were cooked. Managed to get a bite of the spaghetti when the young one next to me keep saying this is better than grandmom's.  It was very good indeed.\\n\\nWhen you go you have to try the deserts.  We decided to get a couple of the old tried and true cooked tableside so the kids, big kids too, could watch and try deserts they have never seen.  The Baked Alaska and Bananas Foster were sweet and very good, as was the coconut cake.  Deserts were passed around and the Bananas were the fav.\\n\\nLemont can be a little pricey if you order extras, but not to bad if you stick to the basics, but  you get really good food and service.  This is a top notch place during the week.  \\n\\nWhat a great experience!\\nIf your in the mood for some good Neapolitan Pizza from the brick oven...M's is a good place.  The pizza's are handmade with very tasty ingredients including San Marza\\nno tomatoes.  The Margherita pizza did not disappoint.  The crust was thin and crisp on the edges but soft in the middle.  \\n\\nWhy 3 stars.  The poor waitress, one, had a lot of tables and was falling behind but very mindful and stopped to check on us,   Finally, received some assistance from someone from the basement kitchen but it was just to slow.   The salads and Gelato looked great...so next time.\\nThe pastries look delicious. When you walk in you are greeted by a large showcase of fantastic looking pastries.\\n\\nI was looking for more of a breakfast sandwich or roll. So I built my own breakfast sandwich on a croissant.  \\nDelicious.  The croissant was perfectly cooked and tasted great along with the egg and other items I added.\\n\\nIf you don't feed the parking meter, be careful.  One person did not and the city parking patrol car pulled up and before he got to his car the meter lady already had the ticket printed before she even got out of the car.  So put a quarter in the meter.\\nStopped \\nby at lunch on a recommendation.  Was told it is good thinner crust pizza.  When I walked in a large thicker crust square pizza was coming out of the oven.  Upon ordering, Alex said I'll just give you this since it just come out of the oven, so you don't have to wait.   The crust was thicker with a nice chewy taste.  The sauce had some Italian spices.   A good pizza.  Not sure if they make thinner crust of not but the pictures on the hand out menu had pictures of both a round and square pizza.\\n\\nThe menu has hummus with pita bread, hoagies, burgers, gyros, and salads.\\nNice little shop with ice cream & candy on one side and toys and games on the other.

The Porch has a brick oven so many items are cooked in the oven, so we had a Margarita Pizza that was delicious.  The Calamari was very good and come with some fried zucchini bits.  The Duck leg was cooked perfectly and the porchetta was large and had a nice spicy flavor.  Was told the turkey sandwich was good, but was to full to consume any.  \\n\\nThe st\\naff was friendly and very attentive.\\n\\nThe Porch has some craft/micro-brews, wine and some homemade soda. \\n\\nLooks like a great place to stop and have a brew and sit by the fireplace!\\nThere is a new pizza place in town.

If you check out the website you will learn how it received it\\'s name.  He had a pizza shop in the Burgettstown area and decided to open up in this location.  Ordered a pepperoni pizza.  He explained that he grinds his pepperoni and named the type (which I \\nforgot), so don\\'t expect to have the little slices on your pizza.  The crust is thinner and a nice flavor, I think it has some garlic sauce on it before the pizza sauce.  The pizza is good.  The sauce is not to sweet like some other local places.\\nNice little shop that is primarily take out.  There is a small stand up counter you can eat at.  Staff was friendly and helpful to a few of the customers that had questions.  The pizza is thin crust with a little chew and good sauce.  Definitely a place for a couple of slices or sandwich when in the neighborhood.\\nWhile I don\\'t get to BT very often, probably over 2 years now, it is one of my favorite restaurants.  The Chef has won some great awards, embraces the Farm to Table movement and it shows in his final product.  Of course, love the BYOB too.\\n\\nWent with some friends who go to BT a couple of times a year.  We all brought a bottle of wine to share with our meals.  Many interesting choices and service was very quiet and prefect.  Had a Cous\\n Cous appetizer which was very good with a wonderful combination of tastes.  The Veal Chop was perfectly cooked, very tender and came with some very good potato and veggie.  \\n\\nSave room for desert.  The chocolate cake with homemade ice cream was rich, sweet and a table favorite. \\n\\nThe restaurant is a little hard to find so make sure you have the address.  The decor is a darker colored and nothing special, somewhat minimalist.   The food is what makes this a great restaurant.  Great place for special occasions.\\nWow, how disappointing.  From the IO family and not up to their other restaurants standards.  We had 4 Tacos.  All were hardly warm, how about warming the meat, and lacking taste.  The health department may have a field day if the temperature of the meat in the warmers was checked.  The Red Chile Chicken taco meat was hardly warm overly moist and mushy. The Carnitas was OK but the Jalapeños made it not the meat.  The Carne Asada was just so meh and had to much cheddar.

Good Sandwiches and good soup and friendly people!  Have stopped in a couple more times and have had great sandwiches.  The Cuban is delicious, it had dijon, swiss, capital and pork on a baguette and came with a pickle.   Also, had the crab sandwich again because it is so good.  The side of home made potato said is terrific,  some small redskins, cheese, chive and small pieces of cured ham.  Now that is cooler I had the Clam Chowder on my last visit.  Very good soup.\\nThe RedWood is hard to beat for a good sandwich.\\nThe food is delicious, as good as it gets.  The set up, trying to get a table can be a little taxing.  We had seven and all the tables and counters were taken and it did not look like any table was ready to leave so we shared a little table on the patio and were offered a few extra seats from a couple of other tables.\\nWe shared the NY strip, ribeye, flank steak, veggie platter, potatoes, cor\\nn pudding and shrimp, and pork.  All very good, cooked perfectly and with a nice wood smoke flavor.  \\nThe four condiments were good on everything and are made in house.  BYOb and enjoy!\\nDark, dirty, smokey.  Told it had good sandwiches and salads.  Had a grilled chicken salad that was sub par.\\nMad Mex Lakeside just opened up in a location overlooking Canonsburg Lake.  Great place on the deck for a drink and a few apps.  Stopped in to try this location after golfing nearby.  Just like the other Mad Mex, The Big B group does a good job of having a funky place with some good fresh food with the Cal-Mex flavors.\\nLove this place.  Great wine list and they have some interesting specialty drinks if you are interested.  Brick oven pizza and wings are some of the best in Pittsburgh.  Had the pork shank and it was prepared perfectly with bacon mashed potatoes.  The beet salad is great.  Save room for desert, they are wonderful.  Service was good.  Like the decor but it can get a little noisy.\\nOK\\n so they have moved across the street and now have sit down and a bar.  Limited beers by bottle, tap, one red and one white wine and a few house specialty cocktails and sangria.  \\nThe place is noisy, noisy, noisy!   I guess no one in the newer restaurants cares.\\nAs to the food, an improvement over what was available when across the street and a larger selection. \\nA few small plates, chips and dips, and tacos.\\nWe had the chips that came out hot from the kitchen which were salty and a little greasy but good.  We had two batches at our table and the one batch the chips were salty but seemed to have some spice or pepper on them, the other batch maybe not as much or by the time I got to them my sensitivity was shot since it was after I had eaten and they were the last few chips.  The half and half salsa was thick and very good.  The shredded beef brisket has a chipotle salsa, queso cojita, onion, and cilantro and was very tasty and really enjoyable.  The duck taco was very tasty with some c\\nojita and some other toppings (forgot) and was even better.  One person at our table had the Roasted Cauliflower and raved about it.  \\nService is scattered.  We had to ask for napkins.  Had to go to the wait stand to get utensils.   But the food was good.\\nSo fun to be able to get a real Maine Lobster roll.  When near the New England coast I always look for some of the little lobster shak's and they never disappoint.  Had the Maine Lobster roll with a nice amount of lobster on the typical buttered lobster roll.  Sooooo good!  Also had a cup of the Lobster Bisque.  The Bisque was very tasty and cheesy and just OK.  The price of the items on the menu seemed a tad high as compared to the lobster shak's I have been to.  The line was a little long but worth the wait.\\nEnjoyable.  The atmosphere is a little different with some couches and a sitting area to go along with tables.  Entrance is thru a black door not the glass door. Two areas once inside.  A few tables in the entrance area and the \\nlarger area with the couches and some more tables.\\n\\nHad the Bamia which is okra with a tomato sauce and Egyptian spices.  A side salad with a nice oil dressing came with the meal.   Service was very friendly but somewhat disjointed.\\nLove the little donuts.  Yay, I'm a fan of the tasty donuts. Tasty cake donuts that are freshly made.  Just pick from the many types and have yourself a treat.  Had to try a couple, since the donuts are small, about 4 or 5 bites, and the place smelled so good.  The Bacon Maple donut is like eating a pancake with bacon.  But may favorite was the Samoa; just like the GS cookie!   Come and explore your inner donut taste buds.\\n\\nfacebook:  https://www.facebook.com/bethelparkPLLD\\nHave been to this location a few times.

The ingredients are all locally grown (you can taste it too), they make their own bread, are locally owned, the staff is eager to tell you their story, and the atmosphere is hip. This location is only 5min from Downtown Cleveland in an upcoming neighborhood called \"Tremont\". Just do it!\\n\\n*I also heard that their coffee is amazing.\\nThis is one of the better steaks you can find in town. Excellent service. The antique bar and the history of the place is nifty too. However, the location is weak - unless your staying near the airport. This is an upscale steakhouse for special \\noccasions, so dress up.\\nAs zoos go this is one of the best. Of course, it\\'s hard to love any zoo after going to the one in San Deigo!\\n\\nI took my girls here this week (during spring break), and they loved it. We tried the paddle boats for the first time. FYI :30 min. is long enough (don\\'t get suckered into buying a full hour unless your name is Lance Armstrong). The kids couldn\\'t get enough of the petting zoo - which is more of a \"goat petting\" if you ask me.\\n\\nThe Phoenix Zoo is affordable: $26 got all three of us in, plus $12 for the paddle boats, and around $20 for snacks and water. We did get smart and had lunch before getting there.\\n\\nFor a Thursday afternoon I was surprised at how crowded it was. We were there for several hours, saw the bulk of the animals and all for less than $60.\\nI live in Old Town Scottsdale, and I will admit the area does cater to tourism. But us locals know a different \"Old Town\". There are 100\\'s of restaurants, bars, clubs, stores, hotels, and services availa\\nble in this area, not to mention spring training games, a park, and an art museum. All of which are available within walking distance!\\n\\nIf you visit the Phoenix area this IS the most fun place to stay and hang out. Downtown Phoenix ain\\'t quite ready... Old Town and it\\'s residential neighborhoods are also very safe and clean.\\n\\nGround zero for nightlife would be Indian School and Scottsdale Rd (all four corners).

(which is why I play at night).\\nI only go here for coffee.\\n\\nThis place is in a very different, very hip, and very old building. This is a truly unique atmosphere - not your daddy\\'s starbucks!\\n\\nThe coffee is excellent and the way the former home is divided into dozens of different sitting areas is really cool. They have a HUGE patio in front AND in back.\\n\\nOnly wish they served coffee after 3pm.\\nI have always been a fan. This place puts out consistently good simple breakfast and lunch - I have NEVER had a bad meal here. They also have an amazing selection of to-go deserts. Chompie\\'s was also featured on \"Man V. Food\" recently...\\nOne of the better chains in town. Their ribs are excellent, as is the potato soup. I also like the dark upscale atmosphere - very much like a Houston\\'s. Top notch staff - the service here is impeccable.\\nIf you need to get pamp\\nered in Cave Creek this is definitely the place to do it. We visited by chance recently during a festival held in the shopping complex. The facility itself is a design marvel (designed by the owners and custom built - they own the building) . The owners and really hands on and passionate. They offer haircuts, manicures, pedicures, facials, massages, and a dozen other spa services.

From the moment we arrived we were treated like VIPs. The waiter (Francisco) was also a seasoned wine pro - he helped us pick the perfect wine and even took the time to recommend and write down some store bought Pinot Noirs we might enjoy later. \\n\\nThe steak here is perfection. Aged, prime meat served on a 500 degree plate with butter. This is right up there with Morton\\'s, Donovan\\'s, and Flemming\\'s!

Excellent teamwork!\\n\\nIn \\nsummary: at $100 a person they earn every penny!\\n\\n- Sorry you caught them on a bad night Donald!\\nI just love this place. \\n\\nGreat atmosphere, great cocktails, and wonderful happy hour snacks. Very reasonable pricing too.\\n\\nBeen to happy hour here a few times -- I had dinner here for the first time recently and was blown away.\\n\\nOne of the best deals in Scottsdale (and close to all the action of old town).\\nGrapevine has the best Karaoke system in Arizona and it runs EVERY night after 5pm. They have another cute bar upstairs that\\'s covered but open-air and allows for smoking and conversation. They also have a huge upstairs patio for dining which tends to be very popular during the winter months. Grapevine is a fun place to hang out - not a culinary adventure. While the food is decent it certainly wont impress Yelpers. However, the atmosphere in general, the staff, and the late night Karaoke are perfect.\\nBars stay open until 2am, this place delivers until 3am... Dealio!\\n\\nI really enjoy their\\n broccoli cheese soup, 99-cent side-salad, and the \"Georgetown\" sub.\\n\\nConsistently good food, delivered really late - what a lifesaver. Give em\\' a try if they deliver in your area. They have surprisingly low prices too.\\nWe NEED a good cheap fish place in North Scottsdale, and I thought my prayers had been answered. Unfortunately, when we showed up around 7pm they were closed early with a sign that read \"out of fish\". I wish they had the foresight to stay open with 1/2 price shrimp or hand out \"please come back coupons\" to entice us first time visitors to return. This place is either very good or just very green to business. You get one more try Seattle\\'s Best!\\nFinally made it up here on Sunday (with a hangover). We rolled in right when they open at 11am. Got the 1/2lb cheeseburger with hatch chillies - it changed my life. The setting is really interesting too, you eat outside kind of like an old-west cook-out. I\\'ve heard this place is a blast at night. They have several beer stations, \\na dozen grills, 100 picnic tables, a stage, and dance floor surrounded by fire pits.\\nTheir chicken is just too rubbery and chewy for me - though I think this is the way they intend to prepare it, and obviously some people really like it. I\\'ve eaten at another location in the past with the same rubbery results. Their shrimp and fish was almost passable. Disappointed as this would be a healthy close-to-home alternative.\\nThe Rivera is one of the best karaoke spots in Cleveland - I believe they have it every night after 10pm. The crowd is fun with folks from all walks hanging out to sing. Drinks are cheap and there is a drinking/smoking patio out back to warm up your vocal chords.\\nThis is one of the few chains I tolerate...\\n\\nI love going here for the occasional faux-thanksgiving dinner.\\n\\nSliced turkey, mashed potatoes and gravy, stuffing, cranberry sauce, and bread... Yum! Their pot pies are pretty freaking delicious too!\\n\\nNot a \"pie guy\", if I was, they definitely have lots to choose from\\n.\\nWell worth $22 for the rock-n-roll history experience of a lifetime. 1000\\'s of guitars and other rock memorabilia. Just don\\'t take any pic\\'s or the \"Photo-Nazi\\'s\" will toss you out like they did me... though luckily at the end of my musical adventure. Expect to spend about 4hrs here to take it all in. Don\\'t miss the great view of lake Eire from the top floor (just don\\'t let anyone see your camera).\\nI am a big fan of Bandera\\'s food, atmosphere and location. I have been dining here for years and always enjoy myself. The employees seem to take great pride in this place, and so should we. Try the steaks, ribs, and the chicken (their pride and joy).\\n\\nIt is somehow affiliated with Houston\\'s (though I haven\\'t figured out how exactly).

IF you want to sing a lot go during the week...\\n2nd try and I gotta say that I will be coming here on a regular basis from now on. North Scottsdale lacks seafood (other than fine dining) and this fills the spot perfectly. The owner/cook who was working told me he cooked for Ivar\\'s Fish Bar in Seattle for years, at that moment I was sold. I opted for the \"surfer\\'s platter\" of fried fish, clams, and shrimp with fries and coleslaw for only $9.95! I must try their chowder next time, I was just too full. This is the real deal!!!\\n\\n*Suggestion: less big shrimp are better than many small ones...\\n\\n*Keep in mind this is a simple fish n\\' chips shop - no grilled sea bass, raw tuna, diver scallops, or caviar.\\nAt first Maria Maria seemed like a cool concept. But after \\nlistening to an hour and a half of nothing but Santana\\'s music, it can start to grate on your nerves... \\n\\nThe place was about half full, though we still had to wait about 20min for a table. The decor is nice and our server was pleasant. Chips and salsa were above par (with three types served by default). We ordered the chicken fajitas and a Mexican salad. Both were good, but nothing to really rave about.\\n\\nMaria Maria seemed like more hype than substance to me.\\n\\nWhat is with people bringing young children into a place like this? The decor should be a hint that this is not a McDonald\\'s playland. The rule I heard awhile back that stuck with me is \"that the menu price should match the childs age\". For example at McDonalds you can get a kids meal for under $3... good for 3-year olds and up. At Denny\\'s you can eat for about $10, and at a place like Maria Maria a really cheap bastard can get away with about $15. What a simple and elegant formula for parents to follow... (I grant an exemption \\nto parents of extremely well behaved children).\\nThis is really good Mexican food on a budget. The decor is standard, the service is wonderful, and the food is amazing. I have been to this location several times and have been pleased with everything I have ever ordered. The tostadas and the chimichingas really stand out in my memory.\\n\\nTheir chips and salsa are some of the best I have tasted.\\nDelivery of seafood? Awesome! I found this place on GrubHub, apparently an extension of the Nile Cafe next door. Anyway, great seafood for pickup or delivery. They have a table or two outside if you wish to dine here.\\nTried this again recently and really enjoyed the ride.\\n\\nThe atmosphere is lounge-like and upscale, the tunes are perfect, and the service is top flight. I don\\'t  appreciate going outside the bar to smoke (no patio), but overall it is a nice place to hang out in the Biltmore area.\\nThis is a family-run, friendly business that will move you just a few miles, or across the country. I have \\nseveral friends who have used Justin and his crew to their amazement.\\n\\nThey are 100% honest and reliable guys -- and at a VERY low price to boot... (less than renting a uhaul and providing pizza and beer for several buddies)\\n\\nI am using them for my move on July 1st.\\n\\nCall Justin for a quote (you WILL thank me) and mention Yelp for 10% off...\\nThe thing is, I don\\'t even like Country music... but I do like this bar. Good folks, great live bands, stiff drinks, and what appears to be decent grub. I have yet to eat here, but have popped in for drinks a time or two. They have an amazing sound system and a large dance floor. In the cooler months their patio is really nice.\\nFirst off Bridgett\\'s seemed clean and safe. Overall this is about as traditional as a neighborhood dive bar gets. They have several well maintained pool tables, a, horseshoe-shaped bar, a dozen bar tables, and on the Monday night that we visited - Karaoke. Drinks are cheap too: $4.50 fireballs...\\nProfessional caring staff de\\ndicated to their clients happiness. Dr. Matt came highly recommended to me from several friends and I am now a believer. I am seeking anti-aging therapy and he is a known expert in the field. Also, they are VERY price concious and try to save you money at every turn.\\nThis place just opened a few weeks ago and they seem to be off to a good start. I sampled a couple of the pork ribs today and love their sauce. This is a family run outfit that obviously takes great pride in recipes that may have been handed down for generations. I suggest they work on the decor a little, though it\\'s understandably sparse with them just starting out - Good luck guys!\\nLate breakfast here today. If fact, I am typing this while I sit at Butterfield\\'s. This is a step up from the Denny\\'s down the street, but nothing miraculous. I ordered two eggs over medium, wheat toast, hash browns, and an OJ... all tasted just fine. \\n\\nI agree with other reviewers that at $11.17 before tip this is a little overpriced for what', 'actual_label': 16, 'predicted_label': 16}, {'text': ' I ordered.

Apparently since the light rail went in this area of town is less bad - it seemed cleaner than I remembered. When I pulled up I was surprised to see so many cars here. Once I made it inside I realized it was dive heaven. I talking about a real authentic old-fashioned dive. Being so close to Tempe (ASU), and with the recent influx of light rail housing the place has a healthy mix of art students, blue collar dudes, business geeks, and drugged-out weirdos. Nice.\\n\\nNote: Several craft brews on tap.\\n\\nAdvice to owners: The patio needs serious help.\\nDefinitely one of the finest restaurants in the Phoenix area. It will cost you, but well worth every penny.\\n\\nI attended a company function here awhile back. All I can remember is that I was very impressed with everything - the location, the decor, the menu, the service and of course\\n the amazing food.\\n\\nI suggest saving this for a special occasion.\\nWe sat at the bar and went on a total hangover-driven seafood binge: fresh shrimp, crab, oysters, clam chowder, and scallops. They all tasted better than we expected. The bartender/cook was engaging and I also downed a better-than-average bloody mary. At this price-point these guys have the best seafood experience in town. (oysters were only $1.25 ea)\\nI got to try this last Friday about 8:30pm (didn\\'t realize they close at 9pm).\\n\\nThe food was above average, and the prices are low, but the atmosphere is woefully out of date and dilapidated. \\n\\nI appreciate the longevity and family-run aspects, but come on guys it\\'s time for a remodel (at least some fresh paint and better lighting). A few booths would be a huge upgrade from the wobbly tables, and I\\'m also not a huge fan of paper plates...\\n\\nThis would be a better choice for a quick lunch on the cheap, or take out.\\nI stopped in here last Friday night with some pals on a whim,\\n as we all like to explore dive bars... It\\'s hard to believe this exists in South Scottsdale - this place is strait out of South Phoenix! We are three \"well-dressed\" white guys and they were looking at us like we were General George Custer. It took the bartender awhile to even acknowledge us, and when she did charged us double the posted price for a Corona. We were obviously not welcome in here! We downed our beers and hit the bricks before the stabbings began. I like other South Scottsdale dives, and Indians too... but this place definitely didn\\'t like us! \\n\\nTip: Try the Roadrunner over on Hayden.\\nThis is a huge improvement over the last bar that occupied this spot. They obviously put a few bucks into the renovation and added pool tables. The rub is that when a band is playing here it totally dominates the conversation, and if the band sucks...  \\n\\nPlease put in a smoking-friendly patio, right now customers have to stand by the parking lot sans drink! They have another less-noisy bar i\\nn the front, which I was pleased to discover was offering $1 well drinks from 9-10pm for guys -  we took full advantage.\\nAs malls go this one is pretty decent. Large and modern with lot\\'s of popular brands/stores. I like the movie theater here plus they have several good restaurants in/near the mall.\\nAaron is a trustworthy and hard working professional. He will fight to get you the best deal and then stick by you through the entire process. I highly recommend Aaron and his entire staff.\\nNot a fan of the club scene in general - being that I hate lines, don\\'t dance unless at gunpoint, avoid cover charges, don\\'t care for standing shoulder to shoulder all night wishing I could sit down, or fighting to get overpriced cocktails.\\n\\nHowever this trip to MYST was much different. We had a large group and a private table. Easy to get in, drinks were flowing (though a little pricey), music was good (ATB), and overall I had a really good time.\\n\\nMy only real complaint was the \"gang\" of dirt bag bounc\\ner/doormen that \"greet\" you on the way in. They are not good for business... (I do understand bouncers are necessary, just save the attitude for the drunken douches that require you to be there in the first place)\\n\\nDid I dance? No comment...\\nZ\\'Tejas always has above average food and is a great lunch spot. I like all the locations, but I think this one is best for business. I suggest newbies try the Shrimp Guacamole Tostada bites to get started. I have never had a bad meal here, so try anything on the menu. \\n\\nTheir NY Strip at dinner is magnificent.\\nAwesome dive bar and casino in one. You get party beads walking in the door, the free drinks come faster than any man alive can drink them, the machines are looser than any others downtown, and they have prize raffles every thirty minutes. The slots pay you in nickles so you get that classic clangity-clang sound when you cash out (and really dirty hands).\\nGreat name as the place is definitely \"lost\"... absolutely no sign marking this hideawa', 'actual_label': 16, 'predicted_label': 16}, {'text': 'y other than the generic open sign. Once we got here (for a friend\\'s birthday party) we enjoyed ourselves immensely - they have a large selection of bottled beer and a great wine list - no liquor though.\\n\\nThe place is small and busy (on the weekends). I did notice a lot of hats (fedora\\'s, caps, and berets) I was not one of these cooler hipsters, but they accepted me anyway.\\n\\nI highly recommend you give the lost leaf a try.\\n\\nIf I remember correctly it is located a little south of Roosevelt on 5th ST.\\nDecent dive bar for Mesa (Mesa/Tempe border off the 101).\\n\\nThis is another place that depends on the quality of the band. The music is why most people are here, and you won\\'t have much luck chatting after 8pm as the place gets LOUD. \\n\\nSo, if the band is good - the place rocks, if not - it\\'s just another average dive bar.\\nI hate to admit it but Outback serves a damn good piece of meat for the money. I also enjoyed their blue cheese wedge side salad. The atmosphere is nice and dark and the se\\nrvice is pretty good too. As much as I like to slam chain restaurants I\\'ll admit this one is pretty good.\\nI enjoyed this place - I think. I was somewhat inebriated by the time we got here. I will try to remember the details... We mostly hung out on the back patio, which has it\\'s own bar and restroom (outhouse). I mostly remember the arm wrestling machine and the drinks being really cheap... I could be wrong and just mixed this up with another bar... reading this review could be a waste of your time.\\nIt\\'s hard to come here with the beautiful Talking Stick Resort and Casino just a few more miles up the freeway (same company btw). Anyhow, this is a good option for gaming in general and bingo. They also have decent shows on the weekends.\\nGood Simple Food. A great lunch spot just off the strip. The Texas toast rocks! Don\\'t be surprised that half the patrons are under 12.\\nFor a chain I really like this place. \\n\\nThe atmosphere is very casual, and the food is consistently delicious. This is a \\ngreat place to go with a large group as they have so many little rooms. The portions are huge so order with care... Location is perfect -- great place to dine before hitting the old town Scottsdale scene later.\\n\\nBar area is decent with a reasonable crowd around happy hour.\\nBig freaking place! \\n\\nGreat happy hour crowd with top shelf drinks -- even better if you stay for dinner -- some of the best seafood I have ever tasted... though it will set you back more than a few bucks.\\n\\nThe decor is upscale -- though most people are dressed casual.\\n\\nWe had a reservation and still had to wait 20min.\\nI HATE going to the Dentist, always have. From the moment I stepped through their door the receptionist was so nice that I almost forgot about the massive amount of pain I was about to endure. Once we got the paperwork straightened out they took me back right away. Being a new patient here the doctor took time to introduce himself and put me at ease. They were kind, supportive, and gentle throughout th\\ne entire ordeal.\\n\\nAnyway, the long and the short of it is that I hate these guys less than any other Dentist I\\'ve used before, and I strongly suggest them if you are a fellow dentist-hater.\\nFormerly known as \"Sundays\"  this place has really changed. They have decent food, a laid back bar, patio, and Karaoke on Wednesday and Saturday nights. (located next to Zipps on Camelback)\\n\\nThis is a very casual restaurant/bar - it could almost classify as a dive bar -- but the drinks are too pricey for that. They have definitely moved in the right direction decor wise and they need to keep moving that way...\\n\\nI\\'m pulling for you...\\nGreat spot for breakfast or lunch in downtown Mesa. The food is above average, and the pricing very reasonable. I eat here about once a week (close to work). I would pick a local place like this over Denny\\'s, Coco\\'s and the like any day. They offer unique off-menu specials like: grandma\\'s meatloaf, spinach quiche, and blueberry pancakes almost every day.\\n\\nNo waiting, th\\ne place is somewhat large and never too crowded. Has the look and feel of a mid-western breakfast spot.\\n\\nThe staff are very polite and helpful, and they get to know you by name.\\nAs the famous Biltmore brunch was not available (remodeling the dining room) this was our next runner up - at $20 the breakfast buffet was a steal for such high quality ingredients. The Bloody Mary was no slouch at $9 either.\\nKinnick\\'s is off to a slow start. This was pretty much a ghost town on Thursday at lunch - the location is also a little isolated. One inexperienced server seemed to be overwhelmed by the \"crowd\" of 4 tables. The food was decent, though it took some time to get. Their pricing is more than fair and I might even suggest this as a happy hour destination - just not as a restaurant. I am rooting for this place to improve with experience as it is located on hallowed ground, the former location of Tapino, one of my all-time favorites.\\nThis is a great venue other than it being in the middle of now', 'actual_label': 16, 'predicted_label': 16}, {'text': 'here.\\n\\nWent to see Rockband Live (The Cab, Plain white T\\'s, Dashboard Confessional, and Panic at the Disco). A good lineup for what was pretty much a promotional event.\\n\\nThe concert was great, the sound system and acoustics are pretty much perfect. I highly recommend seeing your favorite band play at Jobing.com arena!\\nMan, I miss Mickey\\'s Hangover! Firehouse beats the building being left empty, but I seriously doubt old town needed another club. I\\'m probably just bitter that I am getting too old to frequent 20-something dance clubs... I liked the patio most, inside you can\\'t move or talk (on the weekends) much less get a drink.\\nI have decided that my experiences in these type of hyper-large warehouse stores has a lot more to do with the staffer than the company. Its about a 50/50 shot that I will encounter a helpful, intelligent human while searching for my newest shiny electronic gadget.\\n\\nLast week I managed to encounter a friendly, passionate, thoughtful employee at this Best Buy tha\\nt actually exceeded my dimmed expectations. He helped me pick out a Samsung P2 MP3 Player (that I absolutely love) and a bluetooth speaker that it plays through sans cords...\\n\\nWe even debated the benefits of subscription music vs. buy-each-song style services. *We both agreed that subscription services make much more sense than trying to collect every song $1 at a time... (checkout rhapsody and napster which let you download unlimited songs to your MP3 player for $15mo.)\\n\\nAnyway, I have a little more respect for Best Buy after this experience (they manage to accidentally hire a few good ones).\\nThis is a cute little family-run shop with lots of gourmet sweets to tempt you. The prices are fair and the decor is charming. Two thumbs way up.\\nFor the most part this is a venue for seniors. Though I hear they are trying to make the place more appealing to a younger crowd. A plus is the live music they have most nights. The food here is above average, and I\\'ll even admit I get a kick watching t\\nhe older generation \"get down\".\\nThis is a great option to avoid the crazy crowds at Tempe Marketplace, plus it\\'s only a couple more miles down the street. We visited with the kids on a Saturday night to see Toy Story 3 - No crowds, no lines, walked right in got some snacks, and great seats.\\nOne of the most impressive spots in town. \\n\\nLunch here is a luxury experience - the grounds are amazingly beautiful, and the menu surprisingly affordable. Try this for an inexpensive way to really impress a business client.\\n\\nFor dinner they will take your shorts, though it is certainly worth it if you desire a truly memorable, elegant evening. Life is too short - try this restaurant soon!\\n\\nI have yet to stay here (Royal Palms hotel) - but it is definitely on my list of 1001 things to do before I expire.\\nAmazingly good Mexican food for the price. The atmosphere is cafe style with a comfortable feel - much nicer than most of the taco shops around town. \\n\\nThe salsa they give you with the complimentary \\nchips is amazing! The taco and tostada were perfect, the rice and beans dead on.\\n\\nA great lunch destination in south Tempe.\\nOverall decent Mexican food for a chain restaurant. It comes off a lot like a Garcia\\'s or Chevy\\'s... Chips and salsa are above average and the service is good. Nothing surprising (or amazing) will happen to you here.\\nThis is a deli and a superstore all in one... they have all kinds of unique gifts that will get you off the hook if you forgot someones b-day at work... grab a sandwich and salvage your friendship all in one spot.\\n\\n*Don\\'t let the name fool you -- this is not a posh, fine-dining eatery -- it is a lunch deli (though a very nice one).\\n\\nI have met a couple of the owners, very sweet people. Free Wifi here too.\\n\\nThis is a really great sandwich, though the lunch line can be a little menacing (don\\'t expect a quick meal).\\nVery well done upscale atmosphere in here. Merc is also located next to lots of great restaurants... I have been in here several times and e\\nspecially love it during the week when it it less jammed with people.\\nI am a fan, and I will be back. Not sure why I waited so long to try it in the first place. I\\'ll take this over Subway and Quiznos any time. Employees here seem to be overly happy. Hmmm... very suspicious.\\nI like everything about this place - the food, people, staff, and the atmosphere. Try the asparagus with a fried egg on top or any of the pizzas. They are all about the handcrafted cocktails here - try the moscow mule or a pimms cup.\\nSuper atmosphere... the dining room, the bar and the swish outdoor patio are all wonderful. The lounge-y relaxed style is perfect for hanging out after dinner with friend(s).\\n\\nI have been going here for a couple of years, and have always been impressed by the friendly, knowledgeable staff.\\nI visited Comedor Guadalajara for the first time last night. This is a gigantic restaurant located in South Phoenix. \\n\\nThe Good: The menu is extensive. The salsa they bring with your chips is hot and', 'actual_label': 16, 'predicted_label': 16}, {'text': ' delicious. Ordered the \"three meat plate\" (for two) and was bombarded by a metal skillet (with it\\'s own built in burner) heaped with a mountain of steak, chicken, pork, jalapenos, and onions. It was a meal for 4! The flavors were exquisite.\\n\\nThe Bad: The decor is bland, and the lights are brighter than the sun.\\n\\nThe Ugly: Nothing at all was ugly about the place. The staff and patrons were all very friendly. The bathroom was clean. The place felt safe outside even after dark (they have a security guard posted at the door).\\nI have been a member here for awhile now... Though, I have only visited a few times. \\n\\nThe restaurant and meeting space is located at the top of the Chase building on Monroe and Central. The incredible view of the valley is the best part of the place... worth going once just for that. \\n\\nI suggest they consider modernizing the space as it feels very 80\\'s. They do have happy hour specials that coincide with the art walk. The food was decent but not worth returning for.\\n\\nThis is a fantastic addition to North Scottsdale. Wolfley\\'s is a large, upscale sports pub with a professional bean bag court. The food is above par, as is the service. Pretty much a no-brainer if you\\'re in the area. Everyone I know has good things to say. Good luck guys!\\nThis is the BEST bookstore in the valley -- and it\\'s an independent establishment! \\n\\nYou can find great deals on new and used books, plus tons of unique gifts. Make this a day trip, as you will get lost in here for hours on end.\\n\\n+ check out RedSeven Computers (across the street by Frys) for the coolest computer geeks in town.\\nThis is a great local ice cream spot - I really liked the overall vibe and style of the place. The flavors are somewhat unusual (in a good way), and the ice cream is made right here on site. Great alternative to the mega-chains in the area.\\nBetter than the other locations I have used in the past. I am in and out with a truck in less than 30 minutes. Friendly staff too.\\nFinally got down here to \\nmeet up with my girl and some of her pals (they come here all the time)... The drinks seemed reasonable. I didn\\'t eat myself, but I saw a wide range of food at our table: salads, shepherds pie, pretzels and dip. Everything looked pretty good. They also have a couple pool tables, a jukebox, a long bar, and plenty of tables. \\n\\nOverall a nice, dark, dive bar with good grub.\\nThis is a nice little coffee shop in an awkward location. I tried this for the first time last Friday and really enjoyed it. Nice local folks running the place too. Now that I know it\\'s here I\\'ll pop in more often - they even have a drive thru.\\nThis is an awesome little place.\\n\\nWent to a friends birthday party here awhile back and throughly enjoyed myself. They have excellent food, great drinks, good service, a smooth atmosphere, and a stellar location right in old town! \\n\\nThey have a nice little bar here to grab a cocktail and check it out. I hear happy hour rocks...\\nI assume this will level off after the hype dies do\\nwn (I\\'ll be back in several months). For now it\\'s the latest \"douche fiesta\" in old town...  I like the style of the place and the food/drinks seem to be above par - but the nighttime crowd is mostly comprised of obnoxious drunken children visiting from Smashboxxx and El Hefe. In fact, if you\\'re over 30 and/or not a professional model steer clear.\\nI love this casino and visit it every time I am in Las Vegas for two reasons:\\n\\nOne - my favorite video slot machine - \"Kaboom\".\\n\\nTwo - Tony Roma\\'s prime rib special ($9.99).\\n\\nI do enjoy the overall Fremont Street experience and love to stay at the Golden Nugget across the street. If you like the FSE too, try the Fremont Casino -- if you hit while playing \"Kaboom!\" you owe me!\\nFrom the moment I stepped through the door it was obvious how much the employees care. The place is VERY clean too, they even perform minor surgeries here. If you live in this part of town you owe it to your best pal to try Barbara and her crew.\\nLove Bountiful Basket\\'s d\\nelivery option which works well for those of us not wanting to commit to a weekly pick-up schedule.\\nMy god, paint the freakin place... It\\'s incredible how many places don\\'t get atmosphere... I don\\'t want to eat at K-mart (nor do i want to shop at K-mart). What does a few gallons of paint and some decent lighting cost anyway? And update the bar! It is sad when a business owner loses that spark.\\n\\nAlright, had a few pills... mellowed now...\\n\\nThe food is good - not great - but certainly a paradise of selection for all the vegetarians out there (must be 100 items on the menu). The pricing is amazingly cheap (maybe they could add 10 cents to each dish for paint). The menu threw me at first, as each dish is described as chicken, beef, shrimp, etc.. with a small disclaimer on the front of the menu that they are meat-substitutes.\\n\\nAnyone else want to donate some time to help spruce this place up (yes, it bugs me that much).\\nA Modern Mexican restaurant with an upscale atmosphere - I like it... \\n', 'actual_label': 16, 'predicted_label': 16}, {'text': '\\nThree of us had the privilege of dining here last Saturday. The drinks, the service, and the unusual food were all outstanding. The prices are very fair as well...\\n\\nGreat location with several other \"walking-distance\" choices if they are too busy (J Alexander\\'s, Fogo De Chow, El Torito, Flemmings, Quilted Bear). Close to Old Town for nightlife too...\\n\\nGood luck Blanco!\\nI used to enjoy this for lunch on occasion - Sorry to say it CLOSED a couple months ago... I think \"Julio\\'s Too\" is still open.\\nI haven\\'t been in here for 10-years... though from other yelpers reviews it sounds like it remains the same - the epitome of a dirty dive bar!\\n\\nIf you are hankering for a run down old-school bar to get hammered in - this is the place! Don\\'t forget your blade for the inevitable knife fight in the parking lot.\\nI fondly remember the original Matta\\'s down on Main St.... Anyway, it was very slow around 1pm and no one seated me after 5 minutes of standing/waiting in the main dining area (several othe\\nr frustrated patrons just left). I had a better experience once I moved to the \"cantina side\". The chips and salsa where well made but needed more kick. I did enjoy my taco and tostada combo with rice and beans.\\nThis place is old school to the point that the school needs to be rebuilt... I think the crowd here on certain nights might be great, but the place itself is just too rundown. We visited on a Sunday night and were disappointed after all the positive reviews I\\'ve read. This Bikini is dirty, old, and stinky.\\nWhen I lived in Tempe I would grab a late night snack and a cocktail here on occasion. \\n\\nThis place is somewhere between a dive and a sports bar. it is large and has several different rooms to drink/eat in. I have seen bands perform here a few times late at night. The drinks are cheap and the food is decent.\\n\\nThe regulars and the bartenders were friendly.\\nNothing much to impress me here.\\n\\nStopped by here on Saturday night. There was a decent crowd and a Karaoke DJ (worst kara\\noke I have experienced). The place just seemed plain dirty overall - we lasted about 10-min. Didn\\'t bother to try the food - maybe their Wings are famous, but the location just plain stinks.\\nOCD lives here... Visit and you will understand. Luckily the hyper organized condiments wont effect the fantastic frozen yogurt flavors they offer. Good value for what they provide!\\nExcellent little dive bar.\\n\\nThis is one of the least expensive places to get your buzz on in Scottsdale. The crowd seemed to be mainly locals - though a few outsiders (like me) have figured it out. The lights are low and the decor is very dated (perfect).\\n\\nI visited on a Friday night - which featured rum drink specials - they had a selection of tiki style drinks in massive glasses for $3 ea!\\n\\nI will definitely be back.\\nThis is an ultra simple, fresh and healthy, locally owned sandwich experience. If that\\'s all you expect, you will be pleased. I agree that eating so responsibly isn\\'t as much fun.\\nAmazing food, ultra cozy\\n atmosphere, and a huge patio (a little too cold for the patio tonight). The owner operators are obviously passionate about great food and great cocktails.\\n\\nI had the Scallops and she tried the Pork... both done to perfection. Try the creamed corn with jalapenos for a side!!!\\n\\nThe menu is simple yet diverse (steak, chicken, pork, shrimp, scallops and fish), and they also offer nightly specials if you burn through the menu too quickly. Highly recommended for a romantic dinner... I will be back to try lunch next time I\\'m in the area.\\n\\nThis gem is off a side street near 7th and Bethany, and in a courtyard off of that street... Good luck finding it :) \\n\\n*Thanks goes to Groupon for helping me find this place...\\nThere is a crazy cool little pub in the basement of this HUGE liquor store. They only offer beer and wine unfortunately. They could also use some tunes. Worth checking out if your in da hood (oh yea, it is a hood - lock your doors).\\nAmazing locally owned flower shop that supports the\\n local community. Try these guys before 1-800-Flowers. BTW They aren\\'t just local they are GOOD!\\nService here last night was a little on the slow side - and the place was half empty at 7pm. However, the food is very good. I also love how their menu includes photos of every plate. They roast hatch chilies and brew their own beer here. The decor is like an over the top Mexican fiesta.\\nIt was \"under construction\" when I visited yesterday, but I enjoyed dining in their cantina nonetheless.\\n\\nGood quality from the chips and salsa to my chicken wrap. Reasonable lunch specials, and I am guessing an amazing atmosphere from the look of the work going on in the dining room.\\n\\nI shall return!\\nWe told William we didn\\'t come here to buy a gun (just to look around) but he was still VERY VERY helpful and encouraged us to hold the weapons we thought looked interesting and take photos. He is a wealth of knowledge and is eager to help. For instance, who knew that you could legally own an automatic weapon ', 'actual_label': 16, 'predicted_label': 16}, {'text': 'and a sound suppressor (silencer) in Arizona??? Really cool shop!\\nA really good burger for a chain in a mall\\'s food court... They really do a burger justice here and they cook it to order while you watch. I like their fries too...\\nExcellent steaks in a modern upscale atmosphere. Don\\'t let it turn you off that it\\'s located in a mall - it has it\\'s own entrance from the parking lot. They have several different seating types from lounge couches to a full bar. Great spot for a group.\\nI love the location and the view of the camelview terraces. Breakfast was delish - one of the best takes on eggs benedict I have ever tried (get it with ham). The staff are very accommodating and went out of their way to please us. Sit on the patio overlooking the pebble pond if the weather is nice enough. There is a Yelp and a Foursquare coupon for \"checking in\" here at the moment.\\nWonderful experience. I loved everything we ordered from the shrimp and grits to the \"drunken\" opha fish. Don\\'t miss the jalapeno-\\ncorn side dish. The cocktails are very imaginative - I tried their take on a pimms cup. The atmosphere here is very hip, loungy and dark. Our bartender was a little obsessed with another couple and it required us waving him down each time we needed something, but I\\'m sure service at the tables is better.\\nExcellent quality food all around and a friendly eager to please staff make for one of the better breakfast experiences in Mesa. The decor here is a little old fashioned - kinda feels like having breakfast in Kansas :)\\nThe place feels retro 60\\'s. I love the building and their outdoor sign. Rip\\'s is an old house that was converted into an old bar and it definitely has that old-school vibe. It is inhabited by one of the strangest mash-ups of people you will ever find. If you like to people-watch (and enjoy the circus) come down here on the weekend. I enjoyed myself overall, but I\\'m not making this an official hangout.\\nNobody is perfect, but this is about as close as it gets. I LOVE the m\\nenu here. It is so simple, yet new and exciting. The picked peppers are delicious, as is their gourmet version of a Big Mac. Also try their asparagus and the cheap house salad. I really enjoyed my bacon infused bloody mary too. Garage parking can be an issue at peak times in this area - though a valet is always available.\\nThis used to be the Mesa Eatery and was dying a slow death. The new owners have turned it around 100%. \\n\\nI have only had breakfast here, which has improved a little. The prices are still astonishingly low, and the service is reasonable (really depends on how busy they are). The atmosphere in here is fantastic - they gutted and rebuilt this place. It no longer looks like a rundown 1950\\'s Big Boy and now resembles a chic wine bar. Have you ever had breakfast on a couch? They still need to update the bathrooms, but I can live with them just being clean.\\n\\nTry this for breakfast!\\nThis theater has a really good local vibe. It\\'s proximity to lots of eating/drinking options a\\nre a big plus. Not too many blockbusters are shown here, mainly just independents (which are a welcome change of pace).\\n\\nThis place is definitely worth a shot if you have not tried it yet.\\nThis is their second location just a block from the over-busy original. Wow! This is a must when in Vegas! The crawfish, shrimp, mussles, and crab were all amazing! All were served bathed in cajun spice on a plastic clad table. FUN and YUMMY!!! Please open one in Scottsdale!!!\\nI despise Walmart in general, however, when I got a CVS quoted $80 prescription for $4 they won me over a little bit. Of course, waiting on it to be filled I spent the $76 I \"saved\"...\\nDownhill is the key word - I don\\'t know what happened to this particular location but I am shocked they stay open. The crab cakes are abysmal and just about everything else is at best mediocre. Spare yourself and go elsewhere.\\nDavid\\'s is a really great place to grab a burger! It\\'s a small shop with a 50\\'s feel to it. They also offer shakes/malts,\\n Mexican food, and breakfast (all day). I managed the Texas Burger, Amy enjoyed a David\\'s Original - both were perfect. They could spend a few bucks on updating the sparse decor... but it\\'s still cute and one of the best damn deals for your dollar in Scottsdale. I am planning to return soon to sample breakfast.\\n$1 Taco Tuesday produced some mighty tasty taco\\'s, but the place was slow and lifeless. I love the concept of the outdoor beach, pool, and surfboard tables - walking around in the sand makes you feel like you\\'re on vacation. The inside is huge, but feels like any other Mexican restaurant with a bar. Bring your friends and try this for happy hour, or late on the weekends - when it turns into more of a club.\\nOne of the best independent coffee shops around...\\n\\nOwners and staff are gracious, the coffee is strong, the wifi is free and flowing, and they even have a waterfront location. Great atmosphere at night - not what you would expect from a coffee shop in a strip mall.\\nThis is on', 'actual_label': 16, 'predicted_label': 16}, {'text': 'e of the best lunch deals in all of North Scottsdale. They have a seriously good Polish (Maxwell st. style). They also have comfy booths and a nice relaxing atmosphere.\\nHad a great time here last night, despite there being no Valet for some reason? Anyway, this is a great place to bring out-of-towners, it has a chic southwest feel, while remaining upscale and impressive. \\n\\nThe spicy shrimp appetizer was perfect, salad was crisp and fresh, my chicken was succulent, and a guest had the \"Big Ass Burger\" - which is a Roaring Fork tradition.\\n\\nHighly recommend this to people visiting the Scottsdale area. (avoid the patio in the summer when you book your reservations) Three of us paid about $100 total for dinner with 1 drink each :)\\nHooters is Hooters... so I didn\\'t expect much coming in here. However, our server was very friendly and she pointed out several food specials which saved us a few bucks. Anyway, I come here about once a year just for the buffalo shrimp - which they still butterfly\\n at the downtown Tempe location (much tastier). We also tried the shrimp po boy which was more than enough to feed two.\\nThis is great if you are in a hurry, they have slices and salads ready to go. Above average quality and a nice open space too. Perfect stop before or after catching a movie next door.\\nI am far from a french food expert but I had a great experience here. The staff are over the top friendly and accommodating. I love the cozy atmosphere inside and on the patio. They have an interesting cocktail menu and a choice selection of french wine and champagne to kick off your evening. We started with the escargot which was so decadent. I had the Lamb Chops which were the best I\\'ve ever had. The Scallops my friend ordered were perfectly prepared and succulent. I highly recommend you try Petite Maison very soon it is one of the best values in Scottsdale (dinner for two minus drinks was under $80).\\nMy new neighborhood Zipps is just as good as my old one (Via De Ventura). The food is\\n consistent, prices are fair, servers are friendly and attentive. They also have dozens of flat screens with all the games. We are lucky to have this location within walking distance.\\nI\\'m a fan - though avoid the deep fried deviled eggs that they offer every table. They were not at all what I expected (and I happen to love deviled eggs). The rest of our experience from the butter salad to her chicken with stuffing and my pork chop and baked beans were decadent. The coconut cake desert was one of the best moments of my life. Beckett\\'s is an upscale experience at mid-range prices.\\nIt\\'s hard to beat the value of their pre-prepared meals -- they have such a large selection of them, and at very reasonable prices. I also like the concept of a quick little grocery store vs a mega-size super store / food mall. The limited selection at F&E is more than I need and their small portions of veggies and fruit are also much appreciated.\\nVisited Z\\'s on the advice of other Yelpers.\\n\\n...and it was so wo\\nrth it! What the place lacks in atmosphere it makes up for in deliciousness and value. The food is SO fresh and yummy, the prices are really low, the staff is friendly, and the location is great.\\n\\nNext time you are craving a Gyro do yourself a favor and stop here! (they have a drive thru)\\nVery high quality and very fresh for fast food. Their Arizona burger is fantastic with habenero cheese and jalapenos. I also like the way they season the smash fries with sea salt, rosemary and olive oil.\\nNot much for atmosphere, but there is a reason they have been here for so long. Fantastic Gyro meat, and their lunch special which includes a Gyro, fries and a drink for only $8.95.\\n\\nGlad I found this little lunch spot.\\nWhoa! This is a strange place... The drinks flow fast and free here, plus they have $1 Nathan\\'s dogs! Also try the deep-fried Oreos and Twinkies if you dare. The waitresses are very friendly and eager to get you hammered. BTW I will never listen to The Monkey\\'s again after their theme\\nd slot machine wiped me out of $40 while incessantly playing their songs.\\nGood times with friends here on Friday night. I enjoyed the live music, and the dark pub-like atmosphere. The patio was large but broiling hot (get some misters guys). The bar itself is really nice and they have a huge selection of booze. Skilled bartenders and friendly service made for a terrible hangover.\\nBreakfast Burrito and lots of extra hot sauce. Yum!!!\\nZur Kate is a real treat - the atmosphere feel\\'s like your dining in a traditional German pub. The staff are very accommodating to folks unfamiliar with German fare. We loved every bite and managed to eat about half of our massive portions. An accordion player started playing as we were leaving around 7:30pm. The place has some real history if you read the story on the menu. We will return!!!\\nHit up J Alexander\\'s for lunch today... El Toritio next door is closed by the way (not sure if temporarily for construction in the plaza, or for good).\\n\\nTheir menu is ', 'actual_label': 16, 'predicted_label': 16}, {'text': \" our recent stay at the Wigwam in August.  First, they start the table off with a delicious sourdough bread with garlic butter and sea salt...it was so good I could have just stopped there and been happy.  We shared the spinach dumplings with a sweet tomato chutney to start (a little different than I was expecting, but still good), the salmon with potatoes, mushrooms, corn and mustard for my entree, the filet, green beans and cheddar grits for my husband's entree and we finished the delicious meal splitting a peach and tart cherry cobbler.  The food was tasty, the service was great, the decor was lovely and the atmosphere was lively.  Definitely worth a visit...and a return visit!\\nWe stopped in for lunch on a Sunday and found a nice table on the patio with our dog.  The servers were both very friendly, the inside of the restaurant was nicely decorated, the views from the patio were great of the Strip, and the food was good.  I enjoyed a chicken parmesan sandwich with fries and a cider.\\n..solid meal at reasonable prices - clearly a locals hangout!\\nWe hadn't been to the restaurant at the Four Seasons since it changed from Acacia to Talavera, so we figured we should give it a try while staying at the Four Seasons overnight.  We split the shrimp and lobster bisque and the restaurant was nice enough to split the serving in two bowls.  It was good, but not quite as amazing as I was expecting.  For my entree, I enjoyed the sea bass with potato risotto - again, good, but not as good as I was expecting for a Four Seasons and the price you are expected to pay.  The restaurant is beautifully appointed, the views are beautiful and the service was fun and laid back.\\nDelicious food...I enjoyed the hummus with homemade, tasty pita and the kofta kebab.  It was fantastic!\\n\\nConvenient location in north Tempe/south Scottsdale.  Reasonably nice interior and friendly staff.\\nGreat place for breakfast in Old Town Scottsdale!  The Eggs Benedict with turkey sausage was delicious!  We had to \\nwait about 30 minutes for a table, but it is well worth the wait.  The service is friendly and efficient and the restaurant has a good vibe.\\nYum...had to check this place out after I heard they won best gelato in Phoenix!  I thoroughly enjoyed the pear gelato while sitting in the park this weekend - flavorful with figs and so refreshing.  Definitely made me feel like I was in Italy!\\nA friend and I stopped in for a single drop-in barre class last Friday afternoon and had a blast!  We got our butts kicked, but it was fun and so worth it.  The staff was beyond welcoming and completely made us feel comfortable for the class.  Nice studio that is fully equipped, friendly staff and a great workout!\\nI have been to nocawich 2 times and couldn't wait to try out noca for dinner.  Well, it sure did not disappoint!  \\n\\nWe both started with the simple salad and simple, it was not!  It had almond croutons, cherries, and manchego cheese with a champagne vinaigrette - yummy!  My husband had the pork ch\\nop for his entree and he said it was the best pork chop he had ever tasted.  For my entree I had the appetizer portion of the scallops and the tagliatelle...heavenly.  The scallop was caramelized and cooked perfectly over a bed of cauliflower.  The pasta had asparagus and tasso ham with a sinful cheese sauce.  It was lick your plate good!  \\n\\nThey actually don't have a dessert menu...they bring everyone complimentary cotton candy (grape flavor during our visit) and warm chocolate chip cookies - such a nice touch!\\n\\nI highly recommend this restaurant...it is a dining experience you won't soon forget.\\nWe decided to come in for dinner one night after I had to drop something off at my company's office in Scottsdale.  I ordered a VIP Cosmo and was not impressed - not well mixed and tasted of cheap vodka.  We ordered the cheesy masala tater tots to share as a starter and again were not impressed...too much fried breading instead of potato.  For my entree, I opted for the island pork rice bowl \\n- pork was kind of dry, but the rest of the dish was pretty flavorful and good.  They offered live music, but it didn't fit the setting...would have preferred to see a flamenco guitarist instead.  Hopefully it was just an off night and they can work out all of the kinks!\\nGood place to watch sports and have a beer and a burger.  Nothing extremely special about this place, but good nonetheless.\\nWe stopped by for a quick lunch before heading out for the weekend this past Friday.  The staff was so warm and welcoming, the service was fast and the food was quite tasty.  I enjoyed a cup of the mulligatawny with a half sandwich of ham & swiss with spicy honey mustard.  It was just what I was looking for at lunch...super impressed!\\nI held a team dinner in the loft last week for 35 guests and the restaurant pulled it off flawlessly.

The food was fantastic too...we tried the chili cheese fries to start (don't judge...we went to the gym that morning) and each of us had the hawaiian turkey burger - one on a pretzel bun and one on a wheat bun with sides of fries.  The portions were really large (I took half of my burger home) and everything was made fresh.  This is a great \\nspot to enjoy the nice weather on the patio with some good food and drinks or inside to catch the games.  Definitely worth a visit!\\nWe stopped in twice last weekend for brunch - the first time because we were excited to check it out and the second time because our friends picked the spot as a surprise.  The atmosphere is nice and we especially enjoyed the live music on Sunday - much more lively than Saturday.  The service was decent, but definitely some kinks still need to be worked out.  The food was solid, but nothing I would crave so much to keep coming back to.  I enjoyed the baby kale, brie and green apple omelette with bacon and wheat toast with a mango lemonade on my first visit and two over easy eggs with bacon and wheat toast on my second visit.  For Sunday brunch we took advantage of the $20 bottles of champagne and a carafe of orange juice, but honestly wasn't that impressed - the twist top bottles of sparkling wine were a bit of a letdown.    Overall, a nice place and proba\\nbly only worthy of 3 1/2 stars, but I gave them the benefit of the doubt for being so newly opened.\\nSuch a hidden gem...amazing views, beautiful dining room, great service and outstanding food!  We had a group of 8 people at Orange Sky tonight and had a great experience.  I started with the honey poached pear salad with cherries...exquisite, followed by the salmon entree with the faro, corn, cauliflower and potato sides and we finished up with the chocolate tart with peanut butter (my favorite), coconut lime panna cotta, pistachio cake and chocolate mousse cake - so tasty!\\nSuch a great new addition to the Biltmore!  The space reminded me of the Oxbow Market in Napa...bonus!  The service was excellent and everything was made of quality ingredients!\\nAnother consistently good Panera location!  I stopped in twice during my stay at the Saguaro - once for a Greek salad and once for a ham & cheese on whole grain breakfast sandwich.  High quality ingredients making up delicious and fresh food,\\n friendly staff, convenient location and a comfortable dining room.\\nI was so excited to stay at the Park Hyatt Toronto on my recent trip to Canada; however I was very disappointed.  The hotel is extremely dated especially for the super high prices.  The positives are the friendly staff, comfortable bed and incredible city views I was afforded in my complimentary upgrade.  Hopefully this perfectly located hotel will get a much needed facelift soon!\\nThis place is just ok - the smell once you walk in the door is not pleasing...very musty smelling.  The decor is extremely dated.  However, the food was pretty good and the service was average.  Not the best French place in town, by any stretch of the imagination!\\n\\nBeware...does not take American Express either - how strange for an expensive restaurant!\\nReally interesting place!  I had high expectations since it is a more casual version of FnB and I wasn't disappointed.  The menu is very limited, but everything is farm fresh and very flavorfu\\nl.  Have your service describe the dishes and make recommendations.  I guarantee they won't veer you wrong!\\nBeautiful new steakhouse in Scottsdale!  The decor was really well done and it was interesting that they had a pool area upstairs...I am imagining that could be quite a scene on the weekends.  The service was helpful and attentive.  The food was quite good, but pricey and very large portions.  A friend and I shared a salad, the halibut and two sides (asparagus & corn).  Everything was delicious though!\\nWow - absolute works of art!  I was craving something sweet after dinner last night and Yelp directed us to Classic Cakes.  We ordered two beautiful vanilla and raspberry chocolate cupcakes to go.  If I am ever in need of a fancy cake, this will be the place I will turn to deliver something spectacular!\\nWent here for lunch with my husband and two friends today.  The restaurant is beautiful and the setting of the resort is spectacular.  The food and wine list were very good, but our\", 'actual_label': 17, 'predicted_label': 17}, {'text': ' server was not impressive.  He was slow to take our order and not all that helpful.  The entree portions were large, but the desserts were tiny, but good!\\n\\nOverall, a very nice place though!\\nCool bar in central Phoenix...love this place!\\nVery cool place - lots of beer on draft, great band playing Saturday night when we were there, and cool atmosphere!\\nWe stopped by for dinner this weekend with some friends and had a good experience.  We hadn\\'t been to Thai Lahna in well over 10 years and thought we should try it again.  We shared the egg rolls to start - beware of the spicy mustard...just a little will do, but definitely worth it to clean out your sinuses.  I had the panang curry with pork as my entree and ordered it mild...lucky I did as it seemed more like medium than mild to me.  One of my friends also ordered the yellow curry mild and it was almost uncomfortable for him.  Overall the food is great, the prices are reasonable and the service is decent.  Definitely a good \"go to\" for\\n consistent and flavorful Thai food in the Valley.\\nWow...this place is so darn good!  I checked out nocawich for lunch and was not disappointed at all!  The Doogie Howser was so flavorful...the carmelized onions were delicious!  The parsnip soup is not something I would normally order, but boy, was it good!  I can\\'t wait to go back and try a Sunday Supper sometime.  Beware, lunch takes a little while to come out, but believe me, it is worth the wait!\\nThe Velo kept popping up on my Yelp list, so decided to stop in yesterday and check out this place in our neighborhood.  We were warmly welcomed and immediately went to the cafe.  I ordered an herbal hibiscus rose prickly pear iced tea with agave...it was seriously the best iced tea I have ever tasted - amazing!  I will definitely be back and hope they continue to serve this tea...I\\'m hooked!  We hung out on the sofa and watched some sports while enjoying our tasty beverages.\\nI have been dying to check this place out since it opened, but F\\nriday and Saturday from 10pm - 2am was a bit of a challenge for me...especially living in downtown Phoenix.  I was so excited when I heard the announcement that they were now opening at 8pm, so we decided to stop in last night after dinner.  Lively, fun atmosphere, great and engaging bartenders, fun, rotating themes and extensive drink menu.  We were a little overwhelmed by all of the choices, so we told the bartender what flavors we liked and he mixed us up something tasty...definitely out of our comfort zone, but good all the same to try something I wouldn\\'t normally order.  Excited to see what the next iteration of this cool bar will be...definitely a draw to keep you coming back!\\nI stopped in yesterday morning after yoga and enjoyed a Little Miss Sunshine over ice.  Juby True sure is expensive, but tasty...so ultimately worth the splurge every once in a while!  This is a place to quickly pop in and out...not really a place to linger.  The staff was reasonably nice too!\\nBy far the b\\nest happy hour deal in all of Phoenix...free burgers, chips and salsa and 1/2 price beer!\\nI have been wanting to check out Char\\'s for over 12 years and finally made it happen last Friday night!  We met a friend there who loves this place and arrived early to ensure we could get a good table.  We heard the Soul Power Band and really liked them - especially their first set.  Quaint atmosphere, reasonably priced drinks and good music!\\nWhere has this bar been all of my life?  I absolutely love everything about it!  It is quaint, attracts really friendly people, plays great music, has amazingly nice bartenders, and has happy hour with an extensive $5 wine and $3 beer selection until 8pm...yes, you heard me correctly!\\n\\nThis neighborhood gem will continue to be popular, so getting a seat could be a real issue!  Check this place out...you won\\'t regret it!\\nWe stopped in Friday night after a great tour at Taliesin West.  The atmosphere is laid back and really comfortable, the service was fantast\\nic, the wine selection was vast and reasonably priced and the cupcakes were huge and so amazing - moist and downright delicious!  I only wish Sorso was closer to our place in downtown Phoenix!\\nWe stopped in this morning before our flight back East for the holidays and had a great experience.  The staff was extremely welcoming and friendly, the menu was extensive and the food was good.  I enjoyed a half turkey, tomato and brie sandwich with a bowl of spicy chicken enchilada soup and my husband had the ham and egg breakfast sandwich with fruit - all quite good.  It makes the experience even better when the entire staff seems to enjoy what they are doing even when they are working on Christmas Eve!\\nQuick place to grab a quick bite to eat in Central Phoenix.   Nice staff and good food at a reasonable price.  I enjoyed the dolma platter with a greek salad and rice.  It was the perfect portion, flavorful and freshly made.\\nWhat a nice surprise!  I heard about this place on Open Table and then', 'actual_label': 17, 'predicted_label': 17}, {'text': \" did some research on Yelp and quickly realized I better get my butt over to this amazing place!  I checked it out for a quick lunch and was pleasantly surprised.  The restaurant doesn't look like much from the outside and there are very few tables inside, but the food speaks for itself!  The staff was all very friendly and willing to please.  The bread and tomatoes were amazing to start and my pasta was just delicious!  The 4.5 star overall review for this place is definitely warranted in my book!\\nWe hosted a group cooking class the last night of our conference in Scottsdale and received great feedback from the event!  Andy greeted us and laid the ground rules and then set us on our way to cook the dinner for the evening.  Our menu was the Enoteca - Italian Wine Bar Small Plates which consisted of:\\n\\n\\n    Prosciutto, Tomato, and Provolone Tartlets with a Pasta Crust\\n\\n    Warm Gorgonzola and Pignoli-Stuffed Dates\\n\\n    Bruschetta with Artichokes and Artisan Olive Oil\\n\\n    Bruschetta with\\n Zucchini Caponata\\n\\n    Penne Alla Carbonara\\n\\n    Mini Marsala Meatball Stuffed Mushrooms\\n\\n    Jam & Chocolate Crescents\\n\\nThe food turned out amazing and we were all so proud that we cooked the meal ourselves.  It was a great team building activity and Andy and his team were so helpful and fun to work with.  We were able to bring in our own wine during dinner and unwind after our cooking experience.\\n\\nI can't wait to go back and attend some of the public classes!\\nThe third and final stop on our brewery tour last weekend and we clearly saved the best for last!  We opened the door and could hear the roar of what sounded like a house party for Halloween.  Great mix of people, cozy atmosphere and great beer too.  We enjoyed the kolsch and the lady banks (rose and hibiscus - yum!).\\nAnother great Panera location!  Friendly staff, clean dining area and super tasty food.  I enjoyed the You Pick 2 with chicken noodle soup and a roasted turkey, cheddar and apple sandwich - the perfect meal!\\nDisap\\npointing...a long list of beers that they brew and only 3 were checked as available - what???\\n\\nNice patio, friendly service and the wood fired pizzas looked good too, but I couldn't get past the limited types of beer offered.\\nNot sure why the reviews are so bad...nice space, great patio, cheap prices, and friendly staff.  The burger and fries were good too!  My only complaint is that they don't serve the full menu at this location.\\nDecent Mexican food in a nice atmosphere in a convenient location...definitely have better Mexican at Ricardo's!\\nBeautiful dining room hidden in Old Town Scottsdale.  We made a reservation and scored an outdoor table on a lovely May evening.  It was the perfect night to sit outside and enjoy an amazing meal.  My husband and I shared the grilled octopus to start - fresh, flavorful and inventive.  I tried the duck for my entree and it was perfectly prepared...a little sweet with the cherry demi and a little savory with the mushrooms and kale.  This place is a \\nmust stop on your culinary tour of the Valley.\\nYuck...I was served an uncooked chicken sandwich today.  When I took it back, I was met with indifference...no refund either which was shocking!  I posted a photo that shows the evidence - beware!\\nWow...was this place well done - I would like to hire this designer because they hit the nail on the head!\\n\\nI could hang out at Proof every single day...beautiful inside and a nice patio too.  The pretzels were to die for and the drinks were amazing.  We checked out the menu and definitely want to come back and dine here as well.\\n\\nThe bartender was amazing and made the visit even more enjoyable - thanks for a great experience!\\nLove this new place in downtown Phoenix!  The atmosphere is really cool; however, the acoustics are not good (only negative about this place).  The service was extremely friendly and helpful with recommendations.  The food was quite good and reasonably priced too...check out the grilled cheese and the chet - both delicious!\\n\\nCool spot in Central Phoenix to hang out and enjoy a tasty iced tea!  The inside living room was very comfortable and a great place to unwind and the outdoor seating is great for those cooler winter, spring and fall days.  Great service too!\\nWe hadn't been to the George & Dragon in years, so decided to stop in for a pint this weekend.  Decent atmosphere, plenty of football on the TV's, friendly bartenders and a great selection of beer and cider.

Nice atmosphere, nice staff and great happy hour specials!\\nWow...I can't believe I haven't been here in years...next time will be much, much sooner!

Great atmosphere, great service a\", 'actual_label': 17, 'predicted_label': 17}, {'text': \"nd amazing food!\\nBusy, quaint place in North Scottsdale...make sure you have a reservation.  The yellow and white awning is very welcoming when you arrive and the atmosphere inside is kitschy, but cool too.  The staff was very friendly and really efficient with the crowds.  The food was great - I tried the tortellini soup and the rigatoni alla vodka.  Both were amazing, but just too much food for me.  Be prepared to take home leftovers for the next day.\\nI can't believe I have never been to Bosa Donuts until this weekend...man, have I been missing out!  These are some seriously good donuts! We tried the glazed twist and chocolate covered glazed donut this time, but I have my eye on many others for my next visit.  The staff was super friendly and I love that they have a drive-thru window too.\\nA fantastic experience last night...we were celebrating our anniversary and so glad we chose Twist as the restaurant!  \\n\\nOur server was friendly, efficient and extremely professional.  \\n\\nThe atmosph\\nere is classy...nothing over the top, which is actually refreshing for Vegas.  \\n\\nOur wine was great, but the food stole the show.  My husband and I both enjoyed Pierre's salad with tomatoes, green beans, parmesan and a light, crisp lemon vinaigrette...perfect way to start the meal.  I also forgot to mention the amazing bread with French butter...oh la la!  My husband had the steak au poivre and said it was the best steak he has ever eaten...I tend to agree as I tried a small, tasty bite.  I enjoyed the saffron risotto with wild mushrooms and was not disappointed.  Our apple and cassis crumble with chocolate, caramel and rhubard sorbet was divine...so flavorful and just the right portion.\\n\\nThis is a top notch experience and I highly recommend adding this restaurant to your itinerary when visiting Las Vegas!\\nQuaint, relaxing bar in downtown Phoenix attached to the Breadfruit!  You better like rum though...options are quite limited if you don't.

Great atmosphere, great service and delicious food and cocktails.  I had a June Rose cocktail and the Sweet Chile Glazed Udon Noodles...a seriously perfect dinner!  We will definitely be back to try the cauliflower and the balls of fire along with the noo\\ndles and cocktails.\\nYummy - great food, reasonable prices and cool atmosphere for a restaurant where you order at the counter.\\nI have been here a few times and have always enjoyed the food.  I brought a large group of 30 to eat lunch here a few weeks ago.  We enjoyed the beautiful patio.  The spanakopita was delicious!\\nAbsolutely delicious!

We made reservations for Sunday brunch and were promptly seated in the beautifully appointed dining room.  I enjoyed an\\n egg white veggie omelet and a few pineapple mimosas - so delicious!  I loved everything about this place - the food, the service, the decor and the fun vibe both inside and out.\\nWe came here Friday night for cocktails to enjoy an Arizona sunset.  The views are very nice and the service is friendly.  I am interested to try the restaurant.  They had it roped off, so you couldn't sneak a peek to see if you wanted to come back.\\nWhat a wonderful new restaurant on the outskirts of downtown Phoenix!  I was eagerly awaiting the opening of the latest iteration of Barrio Cafe and quickly made a reservation the day they became available.  We stopped in on Saturday night and were seated at a two top in this super quaint restaurant.  Our server was incredible and truly walked us through the entire menu, so we made educated choices.

This place was packed and we were fortunate to grab two seats at the bar.  I ordered a pear martini and the hubby had a greyhound.  We both loved our beverages - expertly mixed and so ridiculously good.  The service was a little slow, but it was certainly worth the wait for these amazing drinks.\\nThis is a great, comfortable and convenient hotel located in downtown Madison.  It is an easy walk to the lakes, the Capitol and to campus.  The parking is only $10/day and it provides in and out privileges.\\nA fantastic add to the AZ dining scene!  We stopped in today for wine/champagne and a cheese and charcuterie board.  The service was fantastic - our server had a great personality and made the experience an even better one.

We\\n\\'ll definitely be back to try more food and to be our \"go to\" place for wine and cheese in the Valley.\\nI was so excited when I heard that a restaurant focused on grilled cheese was opening close to my house!  I stopped in last weekend for takeout and really enjoyed the \\'Merika grilled cheese on pretzel bread and tomato soup...delicious!

The service at the bar was a little slow, but the food didn\\'t take terribly long to come out.\\nAfter a fun night out in Vegas, we were looking for something to soak up any alcohol that still might be in our system.  We found Fat Dumpling and decided to stop in and try the shrimp and pork & sauerkraut dumplings.  They were delicious and very filling...just what we were looking for!\\nWe stopped in this morning to the newly remodeled Panera Bread and enjoyed a quick breakfast.  I had an everything bagel with onion and chive cream cheese and my husband had a sausage, egg and che\\nese breakfast sandwich.

The space was really nice, the instructor was welcoming and the class was pretty chill.  There were several times throughout the class when I (and others around me) weren\\'t really sure what I was supposed to be doing, but I improvised to what I thought I should be doing.

We stopped in for happy hour and ordered the hush puppies (super dry - yuck!) and the cava ($3 off - sweet).  The bartenders were really friendly, but this place is nothing like the caliber of Crudo.  Hopefully they will work out the kinks in their menu and we\\'ll consider giving it another try.\\nGreat place to enjoy happy hour...amazing views, relaxing environment, friendly staff and great drink selection.  I could get used to frequenting this place!\\nGreat rooftop bar to grab a drink, enjoy the view of Phoenix and stick your feet in the pool.  The bartender is super nice, the drinks are good and the atmosphere is relaxed.  If you visit in the summer, sit near the pool as it is much cooler.\\nOh how I love nocawich!  We were so disappointed when the location closed in Phoenix, but were happy to see it reopen in a flourishing area of Tempe.  We stopped in for lunch a few weeks a\\ngo and thoroughly enjoyed our lunch.  I enjoyed the What the Cluck sandwich - so tasty and addictive!  Great service and great space too.\\nThis restaurant had hardly anyone here for lunch today and I think I know why...the prices are too expensive.  All of the special pastas were $35-$38...for lunch!  The atmosphere is nice, the service was good and the food was tasty, but just too expensive!  Ended up splitting a spinach salad and a pasta and the portion was perfect for two!\\nI have driven by this place so many times and never stopped in.  I have eaten at several other Mastro\\'s locations and always been impressed.  We decided one Sunday evening to stop in for drinks and escape the hot summer day in Phoenix!  This place is typical, upscale steakhouse...nice atmosphere and the restaurant was huge - I wasn\\'t expecting it to be so big.  The bartender was nice, but pretty much left us alone.

Excited to come back for drinks and enjoy the great bar too!\\nWe stopped in last weekend on the pet friendly patio to enjoy a nice lunch of pizza!

We had heard so many great things about the restaurant that we had to stop by and check it out.  \\n\\nFirst off, we loved that they offered 3 different Lithuanian beers...such a nice surprise since some of my husband's family is from there and it's hard to find anything Lithuanian in the States.  \\n\\nWe started with the steamed potato and cheese pierogies and they were quite good...especially dipped in the porcini mushroom sauce.  We shared chicken schnitzel cordon bleu and the cabbage rolls.  Both were quite tasty and really filling.

I was miserably full when we were done with our meal, but we'll definitely be back to try out some of the other tasty choices on the menu as well as dessert.  There were at least 3 or 4 items that sounded delicious.  \\n\\nNothing special about the decor or atmosphere, but that's not what yo\\nu come here for.

We took the day tour this morning and I look forward to going back for a night tour next time to get a different perspective.  This is a must do activity when visiting Las Vegas!\\nDefinitely not what I consider relaxing!  They upsell you once you get in there and ended up convincing me to do the full body massage...what a mistake as they only know one level of massage and it was dreadfully painful.  I had to ask them several times to lessen the pressure, but their English is not very good, so it didn't seem to matter.

The shepard's pie, boxty and chicken sandwich were all delicious!\\nA truly amazing dining experience!  This was the most fun I have had at a restaurant in a long time because you truly didn't know what you were going to get...wine or food!  We told the chef a few things we didn't like and then they based what we would get off of that list.  We tried some very unique wines and food and truly enjoyed ourselves.  Where else can you get kangaroo for your main entree?  Totally amazing!  The service was impeccable...true professionals at what they do.  The decor was nice and lots of light due to the floor to ceiling windows.\\n\\nYou must check this place out!\\nWe took advantage of the local resident special this summer and had a great experience. \\n Friendly staff, nicely appointed rooms, nice views and loved taking advantage of the Moonlight Yoga too that Sunday night.

Definitely worth a visit to check out the newest resort in town!\\nDecent, consistent Mexican food!\\nFood - 4 stars...I loved my gyro and fries!\\n\\nHowever, the cons: this place needs music, one TV should be on and add additional TV's, furnish with outdoor seating since they have a patio, advertise consistent hours on Yelp, the front door etc.  Your hours are so inconsistent, so that is why your business is so spotty throughout the evening.  You need to make the restaurant actually look like it is open if you plan to stay open until 8pm a few nights a week!\\nOh, how I love Dick's Hideaway!  We stopped in for dinner this weekend, found a great seat at the bar, enjoyed the happy hour specials and some amazing entrees.

This is a place you come back to time and time again...it is just that good!  The bartenders are fantastic too - great with making recommendations and making you feel truly welcome.\\nWow - I just read all of the reviews after my visit and am totally shocked.

My friend enjoyed a salad and the tuna and she was completely satisfied with her meal as well.  I highly recommend this place!\\nGreat decor, great service and great food!  The meatloaf and the tacos were fantastic - great flavors and reasonable prices for a nice place!\\nI hadn't been to Lo-Lo's since they moved out of the original location, so decided to check it out recently for some southern food.  I ordered the chicken smothered with gravy and onions with sides of mac 'n cheese and corn and a slice of cornbread.  It was oh so bad for you, but oh so tasty...and good every once in a while (like maybe only once a year).  Love that they update the wait on Yelp, so you know what you're getting into.  This popular place gets super busy, so pick the right time to stop in for a visit.  Nice atmosphere, good service and tasty comfort food!\\nWe stopped in one Sunday afternoon after brunch at the Normal Diner.  They did a great job renov\", 'actual_label': 17, 'predicted_label': 17}, {'text': \"ating the hotel and Tapacubo has a beautiful bar overlooking the hotel's pool.  I enjoyed the seasonal fruit collins - it was so dangerously good.  I'll definitely be back before a show at the Gammage.\\nDefinitely the best place to enjoy lunch at Mandalay Bay!  The atmosphere is more relaxed and casual than it was before, the service was good and the food was excellent.  The portions were pretty small, but perfect for lunch.  I enjoyed the halibut and the others in my party enjoyed their lunch as well.\\nI brought a client and his wife to Toro while they were visiting AZ for wedding.  I love the renovation they have made to the space and the views of the golf course and mountains are incredible.  We enjoyed a glass of wine and I enjoyed the beef tenderloin stir fry - it was quite tasty, but very salty.  They certainly have a nice menu and the improvements I'm sure have been a success for this space.\\nSuper busy on Saturday morning, but worth the wait...the bagels were fresh and delicious! \\n Sit on the patio at Camelback instead of at the main entrance on the back side...more space to spread out!  Very friendly staff too!\\nThis is my new favorite place in Scottsdale!  First of all, I love champagne so any bar that is a champagne lounge, gets my vote!  The service was good, the champagne selection was vast and the atmosphere was totally amazing - the decor was eclectic and so unique!\\nWhat a beautiful wine bar in the Wrigley Mansion!  We stopped in and enjoyed a flight of wine as well as shared a glass of Spotteswood Sauvignon Blanc - such a nice way to spend an afternoon!  Beautiful decor, chill atmosphere and a nice selection of wine to choose from.\\nThe reviews of this show are great, so my expectations were quite high going into it.  I would say overall that the show was good, not great.  When it was high energy and they were dancing...I loved it, but the downtime was what ruined it for me.  If you are in Vegas only once, make sure to go see the Cirque shows first before \\ninvesting in this show.\\nBeautiful space on the Waterfront!  Good service and delicious red velvet pancakes with grand marnier syrup - yum, yum, yum!\\nI did a single class drop-in during my business trip to Las Vegas this week and had a great experience!  I attended the Tuesday night restorative yoga class and it was exactly what I needed after a busy day at a conference.  The instructor was welcoming, the studio was very nice and the class was great.  I will definitely be back on future Las Vegas visits!\\nGood burger and fries, if that is what you are craving.  Nice place in Scottsdale Quarter, friendly staff and good food.\\nI can't believe I haven't been in Cafe Zupas before...this place is great!  I enjoyed the chicken enchilada chili with tortilla strips, a baguette, chocolate covered strawberry and an Italian soda.  Super friendly staff, nice dining room and delicious food!\\nI was so intrigued by this place...alcohol and ice cream combined.  I figured you couldn't go wrong and boy, was\\n I right!  The champagne-infused ice cream was delicious.  I also tasted the strawberry daiquiri rum and was totally impressed.  This little gem is hidden across from Southbridge and it is certainly worth the trip!\\nI have been here many times and always am impressed with the Frank Lloyd Wright architecture.  They get some great national tours of Broadway shows and the ticket prices are pretty reasonable.  The top balcony is a little scary because it is so steep, so splurge on the orchestra seats if you can. \\n\\nI went to see American Idiot Tuesday night and loved it!  The show was upbeat and well performed.\\nGreat place to relax and grab a drink at Kierland Commons.  This place gets busy and I can understand why...it is just a cool place!  The prosecco cocktails are good and they have a nice beer/wine selection too.  I am convinced that anything Fox opens will be a major success...this guy just gets it!\\nFrom the outside, this place looks great - individual desk space to work, completely t\\nech savvy and an extensive menu of drinks and food.  The problem is that I used the technology to order a hot chocolate and it took over 20 minutes to arrive.  Seems to be a problem when people are in a rush for their flights.  I had to ask two times in order to get my drink...ugh!\\nWhat a fantastic show and such a surprise that there isn't more buzz about it!  We had great seats that allowed us to see the performers as they moved all over the theater.  Great singing, amazing dancing and I love how they intertwined three love stories into one show...Romeo & Juliet, Moulin Rouge and The Great Gatsby!  A definite must see!\\nNice to have another Irish pub downtown!  Nice decor, convenient location and good beer.\\nI have now attended two Museum Yoga classes at the Heard and had a great experience - what a wonderful idea to practice yoga amongst an art exhibit!  The yoga class itself is complimentary (however, you must register ahead of time), but you must pay for admission to the museum.

They mentioned offering additional classes indoors and outdoors throughout the museum...can't wait to check more classes out!\\nNice theater on the light rail line with a good selection of the newest movies!  This place gets pretty busy, so make sure you get there early enough to buy your tickets and grab some snacks, if you are interested.\\nWhat a lovely place!  We were looking for a central location to meet someone for dinner and the reviews spoke very highly of this place...plus, I love Greek food.  The atmosphere is beautiful, the service was impeccable and the food was amazing.  I started with the traditional soup, enjoyed the moussaka as my entree per the recommendation of the server and my coworker, and finished with the chocolate mousse - absolutely a divine meal!\\n\\nWe have stayed at this hotel twice since the start of the year and really enjoyed both of our stays.  The rooms are comfortable, the staff is friendly, the free breakfast is extensive and you're conveniently located to walk to just about everything in Old Town Scottsdale.  The staff has been really nice both times we visited too making us feel very welcome.\\nVery interesting place...we stopped by last night after we heard it had its grand opening the week prior.  They weren't officially open (decided that was the soft open and would hold the grand opening on 5/23 instead), but they invited us in to have a beer.  All of the beers were throwbacks - PBR, Schlitz, Hamm's etc.  The menu looks unique and the whole concept is very interesting.  They told us the target clientele are families, but I see it more as young hipsters - will be interesting to see how it pans out.\\nWhat a lovely resort for a staycation in the West Valley!  We took advantage of an $89/night summer rate and really enjoye\\nd our stay.  They upgraded us to a lovely ground level room that was comfortable and spacious.  The staff was so welcoming and friendly.  I enjoyed taking fitness classes and we ate and drank at the bars and restaurants onsite to truly get the Wigwam experience.\\nWe were staying at the Boulders and in the mood for Chinese food.  I checked it out on Yelp and the Sesame Inn came up.  We actually walked over from the Boulders and were seated right away.  We started with potstickers and then I moved on to an egg roll and chicken with string beans - it was absolutely delicious.  I am actually craving this dish as I write this review.  Next time we stay at the Boulders, we'll definitely be back!\\nWe stopped in for lunch last month and scored a great table outside with our dog.  We ordered at the counter, but they were nice enough to bring the food out to us.  I enjoyed the chicken noodle soup and half of a turkey panini.  It was just the right portion size and was very tasty.  Very friendly st\\naff and good, simple food!\\nWell, it seems to be a trend with this place...we came here with a client for dinner one night and we were the only table seated in the restaurant - always a bad sign!  The service was polished and professional, the atmosphere was nice and the food was good.  Someone in my party ordered the watermelon salad and they loved it.  All of us ordered the grilled swordfish for our entree and it was quite tasty and just the right portion.  Overall the meal was of high quality, but I am concerned for the longevity of this place with so few patrons.\\nIt's been awhile since I've been to Pane Bianco and I remembered tonight just how good it is.  Since the expansion, the new section is great...rustic and comfortable - I absolutely love most of the pieces in there.  The menu is simple but good, the service was quick and friendly and the food is delicious!\\nI love this resort and this bar is no exception!  Beautiful decor, great service and excellent drink selections!\\nVery co\\nol Irish pub in New York New York!  Great beer selection, great atmosphere and nice servers.\\nWe were staying at the Wigwam in August and decided to stop in for lunch at Red's since it was so convenient.  It is situated with great views of the golf course and has a lovely bar, indoor and outdoor space.  I thoroughly enjoyed my black bean burger (great recommendation by my server) with a side of fries.  My husband and I also shared a cup of the soup of the day (an orzo, chicken and vegetable soup...so ridiculously good!).  Definitely worth a visit if you are in the area!\\nThis place is ridiculously good...so good I can't wait to go back there again.  The parking is very limited, so be prepared to park in the neighborhood and walk.  Trust me, you'll forget all about the parking situation once you try their food.  \\n\\nWe shared a causa rellena to start and it was surprisingly fresh and flavorful.  For my entree, I selected the lomo saltado based on our server's recommendation and man, was he \", 'actual_label': 17, 'predicted_label': 17}, {'text': \"e sweet taste of the drink, the overflowing whip on top, or the little caramel pieces that top the drink to perfection.

Plus they've got some super comfy seats and the atmosphere is perfect to get lost in the Creme Brulee of it all.\\n\\nThis Starbucks has become one of my more favourite ones because when you combine exceptional service with orgasmic drinks you know what you get? One very happy customer with a brand new beverage obsession.\\nAfter catching a show at The Globe last night, a friend and I made our way over to The Palomino for some drinks.\\n\\nWith a western-themed decor, my guess is that The Palomino will be PACKED in the upcoming weeks with all the Stampede mayhem getting underway. Considering the wait staff is extremely friendly, I'd be happy for foreigners to experience The Palomino as being authentically Calgarian.\\n\\nAlthoug\\nh I didn't actually eat here, I did peruse their menu and they have quite an assorted selection of food at reasonable prices.\\n\\nOverall, I was feelin' the vibe. I'd like to head back some time soon to check out one of the many live performances that The Palomino hosts. Maybe I'll see ya there?\\nI don't know what it is, but I generally have really bad luck in Browns Shoe Stores.\\n\\nThis particular visit was no different.\\n\\nThe service was poor - I was completely ignored.\\n\\nThe selection was limited - picked over boots and nothing in my size\\n\\nThe prices were high - they always are\\n\\nYes, they have some nice shoes, but the service, sizing and pricing make me stray elsewhere.\\nKatie C. isn't lying when she says that Sprague Drugs is a bare bones pharmacy/drug store. I have to admit, I was less than impressed when I had a look around.\\n\\nYeah, it's kinda cool that it is attached to a cafe, but that just doesn't cut it for me considering there are a slew of cafes and drugstores in the area that aren't\\n necessarily attached to one another, but they have a far more extensive selection.\\n\\nI'll be honest, the only reason I visited Sprague Drugs is because I was curious. Will I visit it again? It's highly unlikely considering one of my favourite downtown drugstores/pharmacies is located a 4 minute walk away.\\n\\nOn a positive note though, Sprague Drugs is conveniently located right on the C-Train line, off of the 6th Street West station.\\nSo sometimes a girl has got to find a way to surprise her man with something sports-related. Come on, we've all experienced it. Your boyfriend's eyes light up as he raves about the hottest ball cap or hottest jersey with what's his face's number on it? \\n\\nThat's when I make my way over to Jersey City and talk to the wonderful people there. I describe my man's excitement by throwing in a couple of key words that I retained and magically, they seem to know what he's talking about. \\n\\nI've had to rush over to Jersey City a couple of times, and both times they hav\\ne completely rescued me. Not only did they figure out which team or which player I'm talking about, but they also managed to figure out the exact sizing! I had no idea that baseball caps came in the 3/4 inch sizing, so that just shows how amazing they are if they can figure out exactly what size my man's head is without even meeting him :) \\n\\nIf you need ANY sports-related swag, I guarantee that Jersey City will have it. Jerseys - Check. Baseball Caps - Check. Sports team paraphernalia - Check. \\n\\nThe service is exceptional and their selection is impressive. GET THERE.\\nTechnically, there is nothing wrong with Marlborough Mall. It's got all the right stores, it's got a great food court and it's decent in size. Crowd wise, however, that's another story.\\n\\nI wandered into Marlborough Mall a couple of weeks ago because I was waiting for someone and I figured I could burn some time in the mall. Despite all the delightful stores they have (Ie. Teopia, The Body Shop, La Senza, Le Chateau), and d\\nespite the fact that this is one of the ONLY malls in the city that still has the fun store 'Sanfrancisco' in it, I ended up sitting at the food court people-watching. One word for you guys: SKETCHY.\\n\\nI don't mean to hate, I really don't, but the crowd in this mall is a little disconcerting. Let me paint you a picture:\\n\\nAfter an hour of sitting in the food court she got up, and walked to a store nearby. She happened to notice a man sitting behind her at the food court, staring, but she politely went around him and was well on her way. She spent about 15 minutes in a jewelry store and then came out, only to notice the same man from the foodcourt waiting for her outside. They looked directly at one another and she kept walking. She then looked back over her shoulder and he was following her. She went into the Shoppers' Drug Mart store on the corner and he ran behind her. She went from store to store, with him either coming in behind her, or waiting at the entrance of the respective store\", 'actual_label': 18, 'predicted_label': 18}, {'text': 's. \"What The Heck???\" She wondered, getting a little creeped out. She considered calling mall security but didn\\'t want to make a scene. Finally, as he waited for her outside a store with his back turned, she ran out in the other direction and hid inside a store, watching him pace back and forth outside trying to figure out where she had gone. He eventually left.\\n\\nTrue Story.\\n\\nMy experience at Marlborough Mall and the simple reason as to why I wont be back.\\n\\nMy conclusion holds true: SKETCHY.\\nSpecializing in Polish fare, this shop carries everything from lunches and dinners to go, to European cheeses, homemade sausages, schnitzels, cabbage rolls and cheesecakes. Don\\'t even GET me started on their perogies... boasting 9 different flavours (9!!!), Heritage Bakery & Deli is truly a one of a kind shop in our city.\\n\\nBe sure to take full advantage of their AMAZING Christmas baked goods starting mid-November. See you in line? Yeah, thought so.\\nA fantastic espresso joint and a great place to me\\net up with friends. In fact, wanna know a little secret? I\\'m actually at Aroma right now writing this review. They\\'ve got free and unlimited WIFI. Awwwww yeeeeeah.\\n\\nThe location is convenient and the crowd is composed of families, couples, students, friends and elders alike.\\n\\nThe drinks are good, the food is delicious and their desserts are to die for. Try their chocolate muffin - OH MY GOD.\\n\\nTheir prices are reasonable for what you get and the presentation of the dishes/drinks is unique and appreciated.\\n\\nPlus no matter what you order, you get a piece of chocolate with it - it\\'s a very nice touch.\\n\\nAroma is one of my favourite coffee joints in Toronto. I\\'ll be here all week ;)\\nThe other day I was looking for a very specific piece of jewellery for my guy and I wandered into Paris Jewellers. \\n\\nThe first thing I noticed was that while the store is extremely tiny, the service is HUUUUGE. What I mean by that is that not only was I welcomed the minute I stepped foot inside, but I wasn\\'t give\\nn the once-over or ignored, just based on my wardrobe and age. \\n\\nWe\\'ve all had it happen - walked into a fine jewellery store and for this reason or that, had the store keeper ignore our entire existence. Well this is most DEFINITELY NOT the case at Paris Jewellers. \\n\\nThe store keepers were extremely friendly, patient and helpful and I was reminded of what exceptional service is. \\n\\nParis Jewellers made their debut in Alberta in 1986 and have been providing our province with jewelery from all over the world ever since. They\\'ve got a great selection of silver and gold and they\\'ve got traditional designs as well as contemporary ones to ensure every client is pleased. \\n\\nThey also have beautiful diamond rings that come along with a lifetime warranty. \\n\\nThe shop may be small, but there\\'s nothing small about the way they do business. \\n\\nGreat job guys!\\nTaj Mahal was one of the first Indian restaurants to open in Calgary and for the longest time, it\\'s where my family and I went. The decor of th\\ne place is pretty spectacular and when it comes to the ambiance of Indian restaurants in Calgary, the Taj Mahal restaurant is in a league of its own.\\n\\nWhen it comes to the food however, it\\'s alright. Apparently they have fantastic butter chicken (I wouldn\\'t know first hand) but the carnivores that I generally go with, love it there. I\\'m not crazy about the food and I find the portions a little small. \\n\\nNow that there is a vast array of other Indian restaurants in Calgary, we barely ever go to the Taj Mahal Restaurant anymore. Yes the experience of dining there stands alone, however as I mentioned, the food is nothing to write home about.\\n\\nI do especially love their chai and the way they pour it without EVER missing the cup, but the skill of their chai pouring isn\\'t enough to keep me going there when i far prefer the food in other restaurants around town.\\n\\nIf you\\'ve never been, it\\'s definitely worth the trip, but if after having gone you decide that you\\'d rather try other Indian restaur\\nants in Calgary, I\\'d totally understand.\\nI got together with some single ladies at the Brewsters in Crowfoot, and I was pretty darn impressed.\\n\\nThe scene was kickin\\', the music was pumpin\\', and the food was sizzlin\\'!\\n\\nOur waitress was a true pro, and I was really feeling the crowd, especially on a Tuesday night!\\n\\nI love that right next door is a Good Earth so you can grab a hot bevvy and a treat, and then literally just walk over to the movie theatres!\\n\\nThe location is prime, the food is good and there is tonnes of parking!\\n\\nHappy Eating Y\\'all!\\nStepps is my go-to shoe store here in Toronto. No matter whether I\\'m looking for a sexy new pair of boots, or a comfortable pair of flats, I head to Stepps.\\n\\nWith constant promotions such as the one they have on now - buy one, get one free - it\\'s not uncommon to walk out of this store having bought 2 beautiful pairs of new boots for around $100. Score!\\n\\nThey carry women and men\\'s shoes alike and although the store is tiny, they are staffed well ', 'actual_label': 18, 'predicted_label': 18}, {'text': 'enough so that you can always find someone to help you with sizing.\\n\\nThey are about to undergo renovations and are having a special renovation sale in which \\'Everything Must Go.\\' \\n\\nIf you\\'ve been putting off buying new shoes for spring, NOW is the time to get \\'em. They\\'re disappearing quickly, so be sure to get there sooner rather than later.\\nI\\'ve been walking past this store for YEARS and until yesterday, I had never actually stepped foot inside. Why you ask? I have no idea. \\n\\nCountry Furniture is a SUPER cute furniture store that carries everything from chaises to dinner napkins. They\\'ve got a good selection of stuff and I absolutely love the ambiance of the place. \\n\\nThe service is good as the staff isn\\'t overbearing and you\\'re free to look around at your leisure. \\n\\nI especially liked some of the \\'stuff\\' they had around the cash register. They had tour books on Paris, London and Los Angeles, and they even had little journals, bath goods and some of the cutest matchboxes I\\'ve ever see\\nn. \\n\\nI did find a lot of the stuff to be quite pricey however - let\\'s just say it was Boxing Day and even then I ended up leaving sans bags. \\n\\nOverall though, a great place to have a look around!\\nYou remember back in the day when friendship bracelets were \\'the new black\\'? Well THIS is where EVERYONE and their dog would go to get the hottest beads. Yes, me included. \\n\\nI remember spending hours on end in this store with my sister, trying to find the PERFECT colours of beads for our BFFs. We\\'d measure out the string/wire perfectly, and collect a number of different bags to ensure the colours didn\\'t get all mixed up with one another. Then we\\'d come home and dump out each colour of bead into a different bowl and spend hours making the bracelets that would later end up in the backs of drawers or worse, in the local landfill. \\n\\nLong story short, Beads & Plenty More is a whole lotta store! They\\'ve got EVERY single type of bead your mind can muster up and if you can\\'t find it in the overwhelmin\\ng number of cases and displays, just ask one of the staff members because they have surely seen it and know its whereabouts. \\n\\nYou lookin\\' for some beads? You in a thrifty mood? Well head on over to Beads & Plenty More cause they\\'ve got exactly that, and then some!\\nI am basing this review SOLELY on the service I received when I went to pick up a gift card for a client.\\n\\nYesterday I visited this location in hopes that I could duck in, grab a gift card, and duck out all in the span of 5 minutes. Yeeeeeah.... so not the case.\\n\\nI went to the front and asked to purchase a gift card. Not just *any* gift card, but one valuing $250. That\\'s definitely not chump change, so I was ready to get served in serious style. The 3 people at the front smiled and just asked me to wait a few moments. Now a few, that\\'s like 3-5ish right? Uh... try 25. Not kidding. I waited, I waited and I waited. It\\'s not like this was a hard sale either - woman gives you $250, you give her a card in return. No extended serv\\nice required... so what the problem is?\\n\\nThe girl at the front first called one manager who was apparently \\'too busy\\' to help me, so then 25 minutes later, another manager came around the corner with my gift card. 20 minutes in, I almost marched out but lucky for them, I didn\\'t have a backup plan for a gift idea.\\n\\nOverall, a very disappointing experience. If this is how they help a customer who doesn\\'t require service beyond \"please sign here for your gift card\", then imagine how the service would be if I was actually sitting at a table and dining with friends. \\n\\nIt\\'s safe to say that my \\'should have been brief but really wasn\\'t\\' experience left a bad taste in my mouth and I\\'ve really got no reason to give these guys another go.\\nWant to hear something funny? I went to the Vintage Chophouse full well knowing that they have nothing vegetarian on their menu and guess what? I had one of my all-time favourite vegetarian meals here. Weird eh?\\n\\nA bunch of friends and I went over this weekend \\nand when the waitor came by and found out I was a vegetarian, he just smiled and said no problem. He went and talked to the Chef and they custom-made me one of the most delicious meals I\\'ve ever had!\\n\\nWhat I noticed most was that their ingredients were ridiculously fresh, and the fact that the service was some of the best I\\'ve ever experienced, made Vintage one of my all-time favourite fine dining experiences in Calgary.\\n\\nI know it\\'s funny, but the next time your vegetarian friend says \\'Yes, Vintage Chophouse is one of my favourite restaurants in the city\\', you may want to laugh, but trust me, I\\'m right there with \\'em.\\nBCBG has SUCH glamorous and beautiful clothing & accessories, but let\\'s be honest: It\\'s not practical to shop here all the time. The merchandise is extremely pricey, not that I\\'m saying it\\'s not worth it, but I am saying it\\'s hard to justify dropping that kind of cash on a day-to-day purchase. \\n\\nSo you know why I LOVE this store in particular? Because every year during B', 'actual_label': 18, 'predicted_label': 18}, {'text': 'oxing Week, they have an INSANE sale.

The sign is gigantic and all lit up and the space is very impressive. \\n\\nThe service was super friendly and I was floored by their selection of wine! Every single brand and type my mind could muster up, Enoteca had in-house! \\n\\nAs Lindsay K. mentions, they are just getting started so there are promotions right, left and center, and I too got 5% off my purchase!\\n\\nGreat selection, impressive space and exceptional service. Any questions?\\nYesterday a friend and I headed over to The Cheesecake Cafe because we were FAMISHED.\\n\\nI h\\nad not been there for years and it was an absolute trip down memory lane to even step foot in the joint.\\n\\nI promised myself that I was NOT going to have cheesecake for lunch on a tuesday, so for the first time in a long time (and maybe a first ever), I perused their lunch menu rather than their dessert menu. \\n\\nThe selection that The Cheesecake offers had me absolutely floored. They have everything you could want. Asian fare, sandwiches, wraps, appetizers, soups, salads, you name it. Since I was Starvin\\' Marvin\\', I ordered the lunch trio which is a half sandwich, a bowl of soup and a salad. I specified I wanted dressing on the side, mustard instead of mayo, and rather than a club sandwhich, I wanted a veggie sandwhich. Did they get it all right? HELL YES.\\n\\nBy far the BEST half sandwhich I\\'ve had in a long while! Fresh ingredients piled high with care and healthy sides of soup & salad. \\n\\nOur waitress was FANTASTIC. We got our meal within about 7 minutes of ordering and both of us were 10\\n0% satisfied with the service, our meals and our surroundings.\\n\\nI didn\\'t realize how much The Cheesecake Cafe has going outside of their cheesecake but let me tell you - I\\'m already planning a visit back this weekend. Seriously, it\\'s THAT good.\\n\"Hello Ladies...\", the first words uttered out of my mouth as I walked into Gravity Pope. The \\'ladies\\' being the rows and rows of jaw-dropping shoes.\\n\\nI\\'ll admit it, I love shoes. But for some reason, I hadn\\'t discovered Gravity Pope until just last week. Let me just say - it\\'s been my loss completely.\\n\\nGravity Pope is a top notch shoe boutique. They\\'ve got men\\'s shoes, women\\'s shoes and kid\\'s shoes. They\\'ve got boots, salsa shoes, winter shoes, stylin\\' kicks and anything else your mind can muster up that is \\'shoe-like\\'.\\n\\nAs I perused the store, I discovered that I can\\'t afford myself. The first pair of boots that I was drawn to were $750...I know, I know. It\\'s not the store, it\\'s me. They have a wide range of prices, but for whatever reason all\\n the shoes I wanted were WAAAAAY out of my budget.\\n\\nThe staff was nice and the store itself was very well kept considering the number of people that were in it. It was clean (despite the mounds of slush outside) and all the shoes were properly displayed.\\n\\nThe only reason this place lost a star in my books is because out of the 6 pairs of shoes I wanted to try on, they only have 2 pairs in my size. WTF. Talk about a buzz kill.\\nSorry all you Lush lovahs, but I\\'m with Lindsay K. on this place.\\n\\nLike Lindsay K., the last thing I want when I walk into a store is a \\'bath product buzz\\'. If I want to feel like ass, I\\'d much rather say \"I had a night on the town\", than \"I walked into a Lush store\".\\n\\nBeing a bath person, I can absolutely appreciate inventions such as bath bombs, bath fizz and bath bubbles, however, regardless of my state of mind, I will NEVER appreciate a bath bomb that costs $10 and completely dries out my skin.\\n\\nYes they have soaps that smell like cake; They have bath bombs in', 'actual_label': 18, 'predicted_label': 18}, {'text': ' the shapes of cupcakes; They have soap that looks like pie and they have bars that look like chocolate. But seriously, WHO in their right mind wants to have dessert in the tub?!?!? \\n\\nI\\'m more of a \\'eat my pie first, THEN go soak in the tub\\' kinda girl. \\n\\nPlus regardless of their claim to make designer soaps and high-quality products, their stuff always makes me flake rather than glow. Oh, and it also completely drains my wallet... I\\'m not seeing the plus side here.\\n\\nA visit to Lush for me entails a headache, dry skin and a wallet that is far too light for my liking.\\n\\nTwo words: No Thanks.\\nOne of the oldest Ardenes in the city, and it just so happens to be the one I frequented back in the day. In fact, believe it or not, this is where I got my ears pierced!\\n\\nEvery time I step foot into this store there\\'s something so nostalgic about it. I know it\\'s more my memories associated with this store than the store itself, but I am most definitely a fan.\\n\\nAs per all Ardene stores, they carry ev\\nerything from funky socks to unique hair accessories. They\\'ve even got sterling silver jewellery for extremely reasonable prices!\\n\\nPlus it\\'s right inside the mall! It\\'s not like it\\'s out of your way or anything!\\n\\nSo hey, if you need to get ahold of me or if anyone\\'s looking for me, I\"ll be at Ardene taking a trip down memory lane :)\\nMy first experience with Nando\\'s Chicken happened to be while I was dating a guy on the West Coast. I should have known he wasn\\'t the brightest crayon in the box when his idea of a good time was taking his vegetarian girlfriend to a chicken joint. \\n\\nLucky for me, Nando\\'s chicken doesn\\'t serve chicken alone. Unlike Mr. boyfriend, they keep vegetarians\\' needs in mind. For those of us who don\\'t eat bird, they serve wraps, veggie burgers, salads, fries, rice, baked potatoes and dessert. \\n\\nThe food was decent, as was the pricing. \\n\\nI recently took a trip down memory lane by visiting the location here in Calgary, and I was happy to see that my experience here par\\nallelled my experience in BC. \\n\\nThe service is fast, the food is decent, and the atmosphere is welcoming.\\nI LOVE the Pita Pit. It\\'s one of my absolute favourite places in the city because not only do they serve reasonably-priced and delicious food, but they serve HEALTHY food. That makes my heart happy.\\n\\nMy favourite thing to order at \\'The Pit\\' is the Garden Pita with Hummus and swiss cheese. OH MY GOD. SO good. \\n\\nIt\\'s the perfect meal to grab and go. It\\'s not messy, so you can feel assured eating and walking down 17th.\\n\\nThe only thing I wish is that The Pita Pit carried an egg salad pita option. As if that wouldn\\'t be SO good eh?!?!\\n\\nAh well, with or without the egg salad, it\\'s STILL the bomb. Hell, I\\'m heading over right now!\\nI haven\\'t eaten this Joey\\'s for what feels like a decade. And speaking of a decade, last night, I met up with a girlfriend that I hadn\\'t seen for a decade at this location of Joey\\'s and boy were we impressed! \\n\\nWe sat in the lounge and were there for about 4 hou\\nrs. I ordered the vegetarian Chinatown lettuce wraps and my girlfriend ordered the Viva salad. Not only was our food fantastic, but the service is what really sealed the deal for me. Our server was attentive but not overbearing. She got the hint when we first got there that we needed about an hour to just catch up. She completely left us alone, and let us get all caught up, and THEN she came to take our order. \\n\\nI don\\'t have a single complaint about our experience at this particular Joey\\'s last night. \\n\\nFantastic all around, and I WILL be back :)\\nCalling all pool sharks! Want an amazing place to play pool, have some drinks, and actually have an audible conversation? The Garage is the place for you.\\n\\nBelieve it or not, The Garage is one of my all-time favourite first-date spots. Why you ask? Well it\\'s like this:\\n\\n#1. If you\\'re a bit of a pool shark like me, then it\\'s a good place to sink some balls (excuse the pun) and find out if you\\'re date can handle you winning now and then.\\n\\n#2. Yo\\nu can actually hear each other talk at The Garage, which automatically means that your date is interested in what you have to say - and let\\'s face it, if he\\'s just getting together with you in hopes that he wont be able to hear you, well, it\\'s clearly not going to work.\\n\\n#3. The food and drinks are reasonably priced and the servers are fantastic. They GET when you give them the eye and want some solo time with your date. They also get when all you want is the bill.\\n\\n#4. There are TVs all around The Garage, which means you get to see what your date finds more interesting: you or the televisions? There IS a right answer here.\\n\\n#5. Once you\\'ve had your fill of playing pool, eating some grub and getting to know one another, there\\'s plenty more to do in the area. If the date is going well, you can always go for ice cream, go feed the ducks, or go for a romantic walk around the market and the path outside. If the date is NOT going so well, the parkade is conveniently located right by The Gar', 'actual_label': 18, 'predicted_label': 18}, {'text': 'age, or you can always escape via the C-Train which is only a few blocks away.\\n\\nThe Garage is the perfect place to get to know that special someone you\\'ve been having in your thoughts. Put the important questions on the table and get your \\'Is he/she worthy of dating me?\\' screen test out of the way at The Garage.\\nSometimes I feel like I\\'m getting a little old to be prancing around dance clubs surrounded by 14 year olds who know all the words to the latest remixed Miley Cyrus song blaring over the speakers. I don\\'t know what\\'s worse: realizing that they are actually blaring a Miley Cyrus song in public, or realizing that I am old enough to be the mother of all the people dancing around me. \\n\\nThis is where The Whiskey comes in. I\\'m not going to lie to you and tell you that it\\'s always packed with a mature crowd. Not the case. But what I like about the Whiskey is that there are at least some people my own age there. Yes, the 14 year olds are still there, but at least I can look past them a\\nnd see some folks who have been on this planet for a bit longer. \\n\\nThe music at The Whiskey is definitely my scene. Pop, R n\\' B and Top 40. Plus everyone\\'s always there to have a good time. \\n\\nWhat I don\\'t like about The Whiskey are that the bouncers can often be pretentious and annoying. I remember a couple of times my dates were wearing sneakers (the hot kind, NOT the worn, torn kind) and we got turned away at the door. Ahem...the REASON my boys were wearing these sneakers is because they can bust a move. They would have been smart to let them in, but hey, I guess no dance club these days is perfect. \\n\\nOverall, The Whiskey is one of the better dance clubs in Calgary. Plus if you\\'re a student, they throw the BEST Bermuda Day Shorts party in the city. I have yet to have as much fun as I did at The Whiskey back in my BSD days. \\n\\nI\\'d recommend The Whiskey if you\\'re up for a frivolous night. You\\'re bound to get hit on, you\\'re bound to get your groove on, and you\\'re bound to have an interes\\nting night, no matter how it ends.\\nIt\\'s a total fluke that I stumbled upon this place, but I am super glad that I did. \\n\\nThis store carries a wide variety of Mediterranean groceries and when I went, it wasn\\'t busy at all! The prices are AMAZING and their selection is impressive. They\\'ve got everything from baklava to Jordan almonds, fresh produce to halwa.\\n\\nIt\\'s conveniently located in a strip mall that\\'s got a ginormous Shopper\\'s Drug Mart, and yes, a Tim Horton\\'s as well.\\n\\nDo some shoppin\\', have some java and get all the ingredients you need for that fab Mediterranean dinner, all in one stop. What could be better?\\nOwned and operated by local Calgarian Executive Chef Rebekah Pearse, Nectar Desserts is taking our city by storm.\\n\\nHaving graced our city a mere 3 years ago, Nectar sits in a league of its own on the very popular downtown strip known as Inglewood.\\n\\nBoasting the mantra \"To enchant and delight from first sight to last bite\", Nectar delivers on all counts...and then some.\\n\\nHav\\ning trained in Europe and Canada alike, Chef Rebekah brings all your dessert dreams to life. With a mind-blowing assortment of desserts made fresh daily on-site, Nectar is quickly becoming THE #1 dessert destination in town.\\n\\nWant me to paint you a picture? It goes a little something like this:\\n\\nCitrus Chiffon cake, Triple Chocolate Malted Cake, Carrot Cake, Banana Chiffon with Espresso Mousse Cake, Red Velvet cake, custom cakes.\\n\\n*large intake of breath*\\n\\nBlackberry Mocha tarts, Mango-Passionfruit tarts, Raspberry Blood Orange tarts, Banana Brulee tarts, Sweet Potato Pecan tarts, Fragrant Lemon tarts.\\n\\n*Another large intake of breath, beginning to speed up*\\n\\nFlourless macaroons, decadent cookies, fruit cobblers, homemade ice cream, homemade sorbet, brownies, and the list isn\\'t anywhere near being through.\\n\\nBasically what I\\'m saying is this:\\n\\nWith the most delicious desserts you will ever taste, the most inviting atmosphere in town, the greatest service imaginable and catering & pastry\\n classes available to your heart\\'s content, Nectar Desserts is THE place to be seen. if you haven\\'t been yet, the only person missing out is you.\\n\\nSo see you there this week, ya?  Mmmkay, sounds good.\\nFrom the outside, this place doesn\\'t look like anything special. But from the moment you walk in and are welcomed by a super hot wait staff, until the moment you clean your plate to the last morsel, I\\'d have to say that O\\'Sullivan\\'s is one of Calgary\\'s best kept pub secrets.\\n\\nWhether you\\'re into karaoke, slot machines, beautiful servers, beer or amazing food, O\\'Sullivan\\'s proves to have a little something for everyone. \\n\\nThe evening that I went with a friend, it wasn\\'t so busy that we couldn\\'t hear each other speak, but it wasn\\'t so dead that we felt like loners in a bar. The crowd was mixed, composed of students, professionals and elders alike, and the vibe was inviting and laid-back.\\n\\nI\\'m surprised I hadn\\'t discovered this place until just this week. Now that I have however, frequent vi', 'actual_label': 18, 'predicted_label': 18}, {'text': 'sits will most definitely be finding their way onto my \\'To Do\\' list.\\nThe name may not sound all that appealing, but you can\\'t judge a book by its cover.\\n\\nI ended up making a special trip over to The Diabetic Depot (DD) when I just wasn\\'t finding enough of a selection of low-carb foods at the regular grocery stores in town. Word on the street is that due to new laws, grocery stores can no longer carry carb-free/carb-conscious goods. So now, in order to get that selection, The DD is the go-to place.\\n\\nI had spent WEEKS on end looking for a number of very particular low-carb pitas and wraps and I had searched every grocery store in town to no avail. Finally, I found exactly what I needed at The Diabetic Depot.\\n\\nThis place is super tiny and is pretty darn pricey, but at the end of the day, we all have to decide for ourselves what we believe to be worth our coin. To me, it was well worth it.\\n\\nThe other thing I really appreciated about this place is that they had their products labelled accor\\nding to the type of diet you may be on. Ie: They had a big \\'Dr. B choice\\' label under all the goods that are allowed on The Dr. Bernstein Diet, etc etc. I found that extremely helpful to see.\\n\\nI may not shop here all the time, but for the times that I will be desperately in search of a very specific carb-conscious item\\', chances are very likely that you\\'ll find me perusing The DD\\'s shelves.\\nI get that everyone and their dog loves Lululemon wear. I get that it\\'s made from recycled materials, is super comfortable and super trendy. But to be honest, I\\'ve only ever owned one Lululemon piece of clothing and it is a hoodie. Again, to be honest, it\\'s not my most favourite hoodie. I find it very heavy.\\n\\nI\\'m not hating on Lululemon AT ALL, I\\'m just questioning it a bit because the times that I\\'ve been, the service isn\\'t all that and personally, I can\\'t justify spending $90 on a full sleeve shirt made from recycled milk bottles.\\n\\nLululemon is a bit of a cult. You walk in and you\\'ll find the runn\\ners and the \\'yoga-doers\\'. The people that shop at Lululemon are always super fit and super well off. I despise that classism is a prominent part of the Lululemon shopping experience.\\n\\nWhat I do love about Lululemon however are the quotes and mantras that come on every bag. I love bouts of positivity and faith. But I\\'m gonna be honest: The bags aren\\'t enough to make me want to drop a couple hundred on a couple of shirts.\\nYou know what makes me happy?\\n\\nCobs Bread. That\\'s what.\\n\\nCobs Bread reminds me a lot of a bakery in Toronto that I used to frequent. The bread is SO friggin good. You know you\\'re in the vicinity because all you can smell is fresh baked bread.\\n\\nOnce you get inside, there\\'s big bread, little bread and flavoured bread, OH MY! Any type of bread your brain can muster up, they sell it. And you know what? It\\'s GOOOOOD!\\n\\nI\\'m definitely a fan.\\nWanna know what this store reminds me of? Christmas. Seriously. The smells, the looks, and the music: Christmas I tell ya.\\n\\nI actually lo\\nve Pier 1 Imports. It\\'s a really neat store and they carry really neat stuff. I have to be honest though: I\\'ve NEVER bought anything from here. The prices are a little hefty, and I\\'m a \\'stuff\\' purger, NOT a \\'stuff\\' collector, so it just doesn\\'t make sense for me to shop here. I do however LOVE to look around. I just like looking at their pillows, their glasses, their Christmas ornaments, and all their knick knacks.\\n\\nFor a number of reasons, just setting foot inside this store makes me happy. It gets me excited about the holidays and it gives my senses a true feast.\\n\\nPier 1 Imports is a fascinating store... even if you are there solely to window shop!\\nLondon Drugs is a handy store to have around. They carry everything from candy to electronics and this particular location is huge!\\n\\nConveniently located in Brentwood Mall, this London Drugs is walking distance from the Brentwood C-Train stop. It\\'s also located walking distance from The University Of Calgary, and it makes picking up suppli\\nes for school super easy.\\n\\nThe service is good and their selection is impressive.\\n\\nYay for London Drugs!\\nI\"m with Christopher W. on this one. I recently went into this Hooters and it is HURTIN\\'.\\n\\nI have no problem going to Hooters - they DO have great wings (Not that I eat them, but the company I keep likes them)! Plus after my many experiences at the Hooters on John Street in Toronto, I have been missing the patio and the fun crowd that would always gather there.\\n\\nA trip to this Hooters definitely didn\\'t help my Hooters fix. There were only older men in the joint and it was pretty deserted overall.\\n\\nIt\\'s safe to say I\\'ll save my Hooters nights for the T-Dot. It\\'s just not happening up in here!\\nI checked out Wanderlust earlier today. The best way for me to describe it is as a store that carries a ton of \\'this and that\\'.\\n\\nI\\'m talkin\\' jewelry, hats, wallets, earrings, skirts, shirts, hanging lights, motivational word hangings, and the list goes on and on.\\n\\nKatie C. is bang on when she de', 'actual_label': 18, 'predicted_label': 18}, {'text': \"scribes its clientele as the young hippy/bohemian type.\\n\\nFrom what I saw, the store does carry a whack of 'stuff', and if 'things and things' are YOUR thing, well, then this store may just be for you.\\n\\nGive it a shot and let me know what you think.\\nCalgary is known around the country for our 'saddle-like arena'...yes, you guessed it, the Saddledome.\\n\\nUnlike any other arena in the country, ours is actually characteristic of our city and is easily distinguished from any other.\\n\\nI love that in any cityscape or skyline portrait of Calgary, you can always distinguish our city with the Saddledome.\\n\\nHaving been to a slew of concerts here as well, I can honestly attest that this arena is as good as any other in the country.\\n\\nIt's big, it's grand and it's the perfect place to draw crowds of people together with sporting events and performers.\\n\\nI'm most definitely fan.\\nAfter my experience at Jubilations, I didn't want the evening to end, so I wandered over to Aussie Rules. And boy, does it ever!\\n\\n\\nDuelling pianists, dancing, good food, great vibe, high-energy crowd, cheap cover ($9) and fun people; How can all that NOT make for a good time?\\nI'm planning on taking a luxurious trip this year (considering I haven't had a vacation since 2004) and I've been doing research online like a mad woman. You know what though? Sometimes a person just wants a bit of help. Or even just a bit of advice when trying to figure out how to ensure your vacation is going to be *perfect*. \\n\\nThat said, I wandered over to the fine people at the Flight Centre in Chinook Centre and I gotta say - they kinda made my day. Not only was I greeted literally THE SECOND I walked in, but the woman helping me was extremely thorough in her search. She listened attentively to my 'must haves' and within 15 minutes of being there, she had printed off a slew of suggested destinations, along with costs, perks and overall information. \\n\\nTalk about a visit WELL worth my time! \\n\\nThe crew at Flight Centre is an absolute gem.\\n If you're thinking about taking a trip, go talk to them!\\nYou already know my obsession with grocery stores, and you also know how much I especially love grocery stores that are surrounded by other opportunities to shop. So when a grocery store is located INSIDE a mall, you know I'm gonna give it mad props.\\n\\nLocated inside North Hill Mall, this particular Safeway bodes exceptional customer service, convenient parking, easy access for those who do not drive (Lion's Park C-Train stop), a Starbucks inside and convenient shopping hours. Plus did I mention it's located inside a mall?!?!?\\n\\nGet your groceries bought, your bills paid (Roger's Wireless is inside the mall, as are a couple of banks), and add the finishing touch to your latest outfit by picking up a hot new accessory. One stop, hella shop!\\nWhat an interesting concept: An Indian on-line restaurant that delivers Indian fare right to your door. \\n\\nI didn't think it could get better than this when I decided to try these guys out over t\\nhe weekend.\\n\\nUnfortunately, the idea is a lot better than the food they actually deliver. When the food arrived, it was so greasy that I could barely distinguish one dish from the next.\\n\\nThe food was WAY too greasy and a little too spicy to enjoy. And trust me, if I'm saying it's too spicy, it's because it really IS too spicy.\\n\\nGreenchili.ca was a one time deal for me. Been there, done that, never again.\\nHaving been established over 3 decades ago, Byblos Bakery is a notorious bakery in town. They are known best for their white and whole wheat pitas, but they also carry everything from baklava to kataifi.\\n\\nA good majority of stores around town supply Byblos Bakery pitas and not only are they the freshest around, but they're also the biggest. And if you happen to be lucky enough to pick them up while they're still warm, you will vow to never eat another type of pita for the rest of your life.\\nI recently made a trip over to Map Town and was absolutely FLOORED by the number of maps, globes\\n and guidebooks they carry.\\n\\nIn fact, the whole store radiates a glow in the evening hours because of the amount of globes in-house!\\n\\nI never knew a place like this existed! In an age where it's difficult to find really elaborate and extensive maps, Map Town really stands apart from other stores.\\n\\nThey've got everything you need when it comes to maps, and it's especially helpful for those of us who are a little directionally impaired.\\n\\nThe next trip I take, I'm making a pit stop at Map Town. One thing's for sure, with a visit to this place, getting lost just got a whole lot harder.\\nWhen you're cruisin' around downtown and your fuel light has been on for a little too long, things get stressful. Considering there are only really 2 gas stations downtown Calgary (and they just happen to be located near one another), I was lucky to make it to this one just in the nick of time. \\n\\nIt was a beautiful Saturday afternoon and I appreciated that this gas station wasn't busy. \\n\\nIn fact, the staff w\", 'actual_label': 18, 'predicted_label': 18}, {'text': \"as so nice that I wanted to stay a little longer so I agreed to get my car washed :) \\n\\nThey have all the amenities: gas pumps, vacuum, car wash, snack bar (including a Tim Hortons inside) and nice staff. \\n\\nNothing else to ask for - not from a gas station anyways ;)\\nI just got back from meeting someone over at Fiore Cantina Italiana on 17th. I wanted to update y'all on my thoughts of this place and since I've got an hour or so before I'm heading out elsewhere (gotta fill that Yelp review quota ;) ), now's as good a time as any. \\n\\nThings I loved: \\n- They offer parking (behind the restaurant there are spaces reserved for their patrons) \\n- Very nice atmosphere \\n- Great location \\n- Excellent service \\n- Excellent food \\n- Reasonable pricing \\n\\nLike Lindsay K., I don't have anything bad to say about this place. \\n\\nAs for the guy half way down the block, you know, the one that was projectile vomiting all over the sidewalk, well, that's another story.\\nLike many others I'm sure, I wandered into The\\n Wild Bird Store hoping to see some exotic creatures. It didn't take me long however to realize that The Wild Bird Store is precisely that - a store promoting WILD birds, NOT caged ones.\\n\\nNeedless to say, the store didn't have a single live bird inside because that would be cruel. But what they DID have was everything to make sure we can do our part and treat these exquisite animals with respect.\\n\\nNot only did this store have every possible kind of bird feeder your mind could muster up, but they also had bird houses (all different kinds, depending on which species of bird lives in your neighbourhood), bird books, stuffed animal birds that mimic their actual bird calls and more bird food than I could have possibly imaged. We're talkin' red millet, white millet, Nyjer, corn on the cob, nut mixes, fruit mixes, and the list goes on and on.\\n\\nI found this store to be extremely educational and it was a breath of fresh air to step foot into a store that supports such an important cause - keepi\\nng our local birds wild!\\n\\nTake a walk on the wild side and discover all that is The Wild Bird Store!\\nThe other day a friend suggested that we meet for breakfast at Humpty's. I have to admit, I wasn't thrilled about the suggestion, but I figured it had been a good decade since I had been there, so I'd give it another go. \\n\\nI have to be honest: the menu at Humpty's was more impressive than the way I remembered it. They had everything from Eggs Benedict (In fact 6 different variations!) to burgers, and wraps to waffles. \\n\\nThe prices at Humpty's are reasonable and our server was pretty friendly and efficient. \\n\\nThe food was OK. It wasn't mind-blowing, but it wasn't disappointing either. \\n\\nOverall, better than I recollected. Was it the best I've ever had? Absolutely not. But will I avoid it if someone else suggests it? Absolutely not.\\nThese days, it's rare to step foot into a record store. But every once in awhile, I wander into HMV just because I like the experience of going through the 'T\\nop 10' display and I like physically browsing through the CD/DVD racks. \\n\\nI just wanna say that the service at this HMV is excellent. \\n\\nI wandered in a couple of days ago and was extremely impressed with the service I received. A very professional sales guy helped me with what I was looking for and he was extremely friendly and courteous. \\n\\nJust wanted to give credit where credit is due and the next time I'm craving an HMV run, I'm definitely heading back here.\\nI officially have a new favourite mall in town and yes, it's name starts with 'South' and ends with 'Centre'. \\n\\nFor whatever reason, I had NEVER been to this mall in all the years that I'd lived in Calgary. On an absolute whim yesterday, we decided to make the trip over and I couldn't have been more pleased with my new discovery. \\n\\nSouthcentre Mall is like a mix between Chinook and Market Mall. It's got 2 floors and all the shops I love and then some. It's even got some stores that no other mall in the city has such as Murale an\\nd Crate and Barrel. \\n\\nWhat I love even MORE about Southcentre is that it isn't PACKED like the rest of the malls during this time of year. I went yesterday, a Sunday, mid-afternoon, when FOR SURE Market, Chinook and CrossIron Mills Malls would have ALL been painfully packed, but Southcentre was pleasantly uncrowded. \\n\\nAside from all the exciting shopping, Southcentre mall also has a stellar food court with unique restaurants in it such as Rasoee, an Indian cuisine fast food joint. \\n\\nIn the two hours that I spent at Southcentre Mall, I visited all my favourite shops, visited shops I've never been too, had a bite in the food court at a restaurant I've never tried, had rockstar parking because it wasn't packed, and I enjoyed line-free stores and easy-breezy shopping. You see why I love it so much?!?!?\\nSo right now I'm in the phase of my life where I have just moved back to Calgary and I'm looking forward to moving into my own place. The best part about getting a new place is the furnishin\", 'actual_label': 18, 'predicted_label': 18}, {'text': \"g and decorating part of it.\\n\\nNaturally I've been visiting home/kitchen stores like they're going out of style and it was only a matter of time before I made my way into Home Outfitters.\\n\\nCouple things:\\n-I did appreciate the fact that when I went, this store was not crowded like I know it sometimes can be\\n- Despite its empty aisles however, I found this store unbelievably overwhelming. There's stuff EVERYWHERE. I honestly didn't know where to look first.\\n\\nThe service didn't stand out because the only place I saw people were behind the registers - which wasn't helpful to me because I didn't make it that far.\\n\\nI'm glad I deflowered my 'Home Outfitters' self but chances aren't very likely that I'll be back. There's no reason to: There's far better service and far better pricing elsewhere!\\nI have to give mad props to the lovely ladies workin' at BOTH the Jacob store itself, AND the Jacob Connexion store right next door. \\n\\nI've been looking for a particular type of sweater FOREVER and Jacob\\n just seemed like the place to get it. Lucky for me, I happened to come across a group of 3 fantastic saleswomen who were working at this 'duo-store.' \\n\\nOne of the girls actually tried on the sweater for me, because I was wearing a dress. She took the time to put all her stuff down and try the sweater on so that I could see what it would look like on. I thought that was super sweet considering the store was pretty busy, but she was adamant about helping me find exactly what I was looking for. \\n\\nSure enough, I ended up leaving with exactly what I had envisioned. \\n\\nI can't stress to you how great the service was in both these stores! Happy shopping y'all!\\nIf you love Thai food like I do, DEFINITELY try the Rose Garden's Lunch Buffet (cost is around $15/person)\\n\\nEverything from the salad rolls, all the way to the sticky rice mango dessert is DELICIOUS. Plus, being a vegetarian, it's nice to see they have meatless options in their buffet.\\n\\nThe decor is beautiful & welcoming, and the servic\\ne has been good every time I have been.\\n\\nBe warned: this place is PACKED during lunch hours, but it's definitely worth the wait.\\nReasons why I enjoy Juan's Mexican Restaurante:\\n\\n- It's Mexican food...need I say more?\\n- It's location is PRIME - right on Stephen Ave\\n- The service is great\\n- The prices are reasonable\\n- You can go there and have dessert as your main course :)\\n\\nTo anyone going to Juan's for the first time, I highly recommend the Champinones Al Ajillo as the appetizer. Their Burritos, Enchiladas and Tostadas are delicious as the main course, and I MUST emphasize that the absolute piece de resistance is their fried ice cream for dessert. If you're feeling ballsy, do what I did and order the friend ice cream as your entree. Trust me, your tastebuds will thank you.\\nTHE best service I have ever had at a CIBC. EVER.\\n\\nThe staff here makes a conscious effort to go above and beyond when it comes to customer service. In fact, if you get there a few minutes early, you can always be su\\nre to see the manager having a meeting with the employees. I'd imagine they'd be talking about a whole lot of things, but I can guarantee that one of them is how to go about dealing with clients. They truly shine in this area; their level of customer service is exceptional.\\n\\nI've never had a problem here and I've always left with a smile on my face. \\n\\nThank you to the wonderful staff at this location - your hard work is being noticed and I thank you all for a job VERY well done!\\nBulldog is a very hip coffee joint in town. Not only is their java good, but it's also beeeeauutiful! They take special care in creating jaw-dropping designs atop every single glass.\\n\\nAnd their coffee isn't the only thing they've got going for them, their food is delicious as well. I'm a big fan of their scones and their cookies!\\n\\nThe prices are reasonable and the staff is extremely friendly.\\n\\nMy only one complaint is that the space is a little too snug for my liking. In my books, bigger really is better ;)\\nMy \\nMom woke up this past Saturday morning with an unbearable tooth ache, and after having called her regular dentist to no avail, we started researching walk-in dental clinics in Calgary.\\n\\nWe decided to try Expressions Dental (formerly Petra Dental Group) because they take walk-ins and emergency appointments. They told us to come in right away (My Mom's regular dentist, whom she's been going to for the last 20 years, said the earliest they could get her in was Monday night at 7pm).\\n\\nAs soon as we got there, we were greeted by two lovely ladies at the front who had us fill out some information. Within 5 minutes, my Mom had already gone in to see first the dental assistant Casey, and then the AMAZING doctor, Dr. Lori Gee.\\n\\nDr. Gee suggested she pull the tooth, which she did, and scheduled a follow-up appointment for one week later, which will be free of charge. 3 X-rays, 1 tooth pulled and a follow up appointment ended up costing $295, which is EXTREMELY reasonable, considering my Mom's reg\", 'actual_label': 18, 'predicted_label': 18}, {'text': 'here, I only saw one other customer.

The overall blend of flavours and hot/cold was amazing and very refreshing. \\n-Tortilla soup had a nice tomato flavor with a nice amount of avocado and tortilla chips\\n-They have a nice drink menu with sangria, margarita, mojito, Corona, etc. \\n\\nDislikes:\\n-Service is slightly slow, but worth the wait.\\n-Drinks seem expensive\\n\\nOverall though, I\\'d visit again because this place has some true authentic Mexican food.\\nThere\\'s something very nostalgic about pita pit with me.  I first got introduced to fast food pitas when I was at university about 15 years ago and remember being in a d\\norm room and ordering a pita and having this guy on a bike deliver it to us (basically the green version of Skip The Dishes).  On a side note, I was in uni 15 years ago!!!! Crap! I\\'m old!!.  \\n\\nI digress, but I definitely like the options here better than Extreme Pita.  Extreme Pita caters to the more generic taste buds whereas pita pit has a fusion of Middle Eastern and North American.  I had the regular spicy black bean pita and it was great.  I got a bunch of grilled veggies on it, beans, a bunch of other greens with chipotle mayo and it filled my tummy without making me feeling bloated.\\n\\nVerdict: if you are in the area, and want a quick, fast healthy meal (as opposed to Smoke\\'s Poutine or Burger\\'s Priest), this is a great choice.\\nHad the pho special from this little joint next to Oceans.  Prices are reasonable and food was fairly good, however I found the portions a bit smaller than normal and slightly pricier.  Like maybe $0.50 to $0.75 more expensive.  Not a big deal and maybe it\\'\\ns because I\\'m spoiled by the abundance of Vietnamese places in Mississauga.\\n\\nOverall, it\\'s good for the area but nothing to go out of your way for.\\nCame here when it first opened and was really good. Went here again while waiting for my gf to do some spa type treatment and the food was great!  Best part? It was free!  The guy was a trainee and his manager gave it to me for being so patient and it was the first one he made for a customer!  Awesome service!\\nGreat service here.  I wanted to haggle more with them but the service here is so great, that I can\\'t really complain. Got a \"smart\" flip cover case and screen protector for my S4 for $15 and they put it on for me. Smart cover is cool as you can answer the phone without opening the case.\\nProbably more like 3.5 stars.  \\n\\nI bought a Groupon for this place ($29 for 10 classes; they also have a one month option for unlimited for $39 and two months for $69).\\n\\nI think the $29 is the best deal unless you plan to attend more than 10 classes p\\ner month, which is kind of tough (but if you do - good on you, you\\'re gonna be shredded).  \\n\\nI didn\\'t have much time to look at the gym, but from what I can see, this gym specializes in boot camps and personal training.  I\\'m not sure if they provide access to their gym besides their classes.\\n\\nIn terms of the equipment I saw, it was freeweights, suspension ropes, those yellow things that you do pull-ups/dips on, tires, punching bags and a couple of rowing machines.  \\n\\nThe classes themselves are fairly large (10-20 people) which I think is the perfect amount.  It\\'s small enough that they can pay some personal attention to you, while not totally focusing on you too.  You go at your own pace, but I always to try to stay with the group to keep going.  It\\'s a good workout.  \\n\\nVerdict:  If you are looking for a gym where you can get a full body workout and can\\'t afford personal training and need motivation to exercise, then this is the perfect environment.  The trainers are friendly as are th\\ne members.  \\n\\nHowever, if you are a person who doesn\\'t need motivation, needs weight machines and cardio machines, then this probably isn\\'t the place.  However, if boot camps are your things, the atmosphere is great and very inviting.\\nA brand new Fit for Life opened in the Hudson\\'s Bay Centre near Yonge and Bloor. I was super excited as I thought they would have plenty of healthy options including lots of vegan options.  Sadly, they only have one or two vegetarian options for breakfast and lunch/dinner.  I came on the first day (and I\\'ll excuse hiccups because they were obviously trying to work through the kinks) and got a vegetable burrito which was okay.  Nowadays, when I order a burrito, they either put in brown rice or give you a choice of brown or white rice.  This place only had white rice. So I stuck with it, but I seriously don\\'t understand how a place called Fit for Life can only have white rice and no other grain options. \\n\\nAt 8.99, the burrito was not cheap, it was somewhat ', 'actual_label': 19, 'predicted_label': 19}, {'text': 'filling, but not necessarily satisfying. I felt it was missing something. They had guacamole, but I didn\\'t really taste it.\\n\\nVerdict: It\\'s normal fast food \\'healthy\\' but nothing spectacular.  I\\'d rather go to Salad Days.\\nDue to Pho Mi 99 on Grand Park being a bit of a disappointment these days and Golden Turtle being closed, this is my new local pho joint as it\\'s close to my house/near Square One.\\n\\nUnfortunately, these guys seem to be empty most of time (only 3-4 people in there at any time) and I\\'m not sure why. It may be the location because even though they are located on Hurontario (arguably the busiest street in Mississauga), the plaza it is in is quite dingy.  Regardless, I\\'m starting to really like this place for the following reasons:\\n\\n-The servers are really nice.  It\\'s a family run business and they operate as such as they seem to remember/know everyone\\'s name.\\n-They seem to have daily lunch specials which are different than other places.  I had My Tho today (seafood plus bee\\nf and some pork) with glass noodles in broth and I also had some type of duck pho on another day for very reasonable prices  Their broth isn\\'t overly salty but still very tasty.  \\n-Their special pho is pretty decent and comparable to all other places.  \\n-It\\'s a bit more sophisticated than other pho joints as they seat you and actually talk to you instead of just pointing and not saying anything.  \\n-The actual normal \"special\" pho is pretty good.  I like the broth and the amount of meat, however my only minor issue is that there isn\\'t enough rare beef.  \\n\\nVerdict: If you are in the area and are considering Golden Turtle or Pho Mi 99 @ Grand Park, I\\'d re-consider and come here instead.\\n\\nTip: Debit/cash only.\\nSo this isn\\'t really a \"town centre\" or a mall, but it\\'s more of just a lot of big box stores within the same area.  There are lots of brand name stores like Best Buy, Future Shop, 2001 Audio Video, Sony, Tiger Direct, Banana Republic, Wal-mart, Canadian Tire, BCBG, Rockport, Winners\\n, HomeSense, Marshalls\\' and the list goes on.  Some of these are outlet stores and some are just normal stores.  It\\'s definitely a good place for people to go shopping as long as you have a car.  \\n\\nSo, come to this area if:\\n1. You are driving/have a car (not pedestrian friendly);\\n2. Are looking for decent clothing deals; and\\n3. Don\\'t mind long lineups and slightly congested traffic.  \\n\\nBut do not come here if:\\n1. You are taking the bus. You will spend hours getting from one plaza to another\\n2. Are looking for great food (though I just saw that Tandoori Flame is opening this fall where Tuckers used to be)\\n3.  you are that person who has to \"tag along\" with your significant other to all the stores.  You won\\'t have anything to do except suffer in the store and dream of your reward later for being so patient.  :-)\\n\\nHonestly, this is better than Square One for shopping, but if you are looking for really good food, not the place.  Actually, this place is probably better than the newly opened\\n Premium Outlets.\\nI took a trial lesson here and they were very patient.  As a result of their patience, I decided to take a few paid lessons.  While the studio is quite small, there is enough parking (at least during the evening and on Saturdays), \\n\\nI\\'ve taken a few private lessons with them and the instruction style is a good balance between making sure you have the proper steps and making you do them right and also patience (since people are bound to make mistakes).  She makes you feel comfortable as well and you don\\'t feel the least bit intimidated even though there are all levels of dancers around you.\\n\\nOverall, so far a pretty good experience.\\nAlrighty folks, will get straight to the point here.\\n\\nCoffee: Better than Tim\\'s but not as good as McD\\'s and no loyalty card that I am aware of.\\n\\nFood: Breakfast combos are cheap as they start at 3.99, fairly tasty and more options than Tim\\'s.\\n\\nService: slightly longer than Tim\\'s and McD\\'s but more personable.\\n\\nVerdict: I like this place.\\nI\\n\\'ve been to this place three times in the past three years.  I haven\\'t reviewed them because I felt like I had to give them a few more tries.\\n\\nI think I\\'ve had a bun, a Portuguese tart and an apple danish on my latest visit.\\n\\nThis place looks like your typical European deli/cafe with a few tables, except they have 3 or 4 large booths that can fit 4-5 people at the back.  \\n\\nIn terms of selection, they have lots of fresh breads and desserts. I would say they probably have more than Nova.  \\n\\nWith regards to the apple danish I had - I really liked the flavours, but I found the pastry itself to be a bit soft and not flakey enough for my liking.  \\n\\nVerdict: It\\'s a good quick bite before or after your commute from the Cooksville GO.\\nOkay, maybe I\\'m spoiled by having Qoola so close to me, but this place did not live up to expectations. I dropped by this place on my way home to have some frozen yogurt with some fresh fruit. However, I was quite disappointed as it didn\\'t have fresh fruits and al', 'actual_label': 19, 'predicted_label': 19}, {'text': 'l they had were some frozen fruits and some imitation fruits.  while I really enjoyed the yogurt itself, I did not really enjoy the toppings.  I got some mango and lychee poppa or bobba (something like that) and some type of nut topping.  At $0.59/oz, I thought the ingredients would at least taste fresh.\\n\\nNope, once I bit into it, I was like \"wow, these are canned mangos and sugar balls made to taste like lychee\".  That \"wow\" was a \"omg, people actually like this stuff?\"  I know, I know, people will be thinking \"why don\\'t you get the sweeter toppings\"?  I don\\'t like sweets, but I love yogurts and I love fruits.  They go perfectly together.  So this may be a great place to get a \"dessert\" snack, but not a great place if you are in the craving for a fruity yogurt.  Sorry.\\nI came here for lunch last week and ordered the beef dinner plate for $9.95.  It came with rice, salad, beans, sour cream and salsa.   \\n\\nI thought everything was okay, but not outstanding.  In addition, I asked for the \\nsalsa medium spicy and wasn\\'t even spicy to me.  The beef was tasty, but slightly too tough however there was an ample amount. The sides were alright.  \\n\\nSo would I return to this place? Sure, why not?  Would I make a special trip to Toronto for this place? Most likely not.\\nBest \"shopping\" mall ever...in that a woman can\\'t really shop here and all you can do is eat!!! LOVING IT!  lol\\n\\nThis is a giant Asian food court that has at least 2 of every type of oriental food (sushi, Korean, dumpling house, congee places, HK style cafe) and plus there is an actual food court inside the mall.  My favourite places here are Ding Tai Fung, Szechuan Garden and Congee Wong.   Oh yeah, besides food, there is a golf store and a movie theatre.  Not sure why there is a golf store...but oh well.  \\n\\nThe only downside is that it can be hard to find parking here during the lunch and dinner hours, but otherwise, solid food mall (*cough* shopping mall).  \\n\\nIt\\'s a good middle of the night place, where you can c\\natch a movie and eat dinner.\\nHeadline: Decent vegan food, but pricey.   \\nDate of most recent visit before review: 12/24/2013\\n# of Visits: 1\\nFood order(s): BBQ tofu stir fry, small corn soup\\n\\n\\nPros:  \\n-BBQ tofu stir fry tasted almost on par with my mom\\'s and I liked the fact it came with avocado.  \\n-Everything is vegan\\n-Corn soup has plenty of veggies and it tastes like it includes pumpkin and/or squash.\\n-Entrees appear to be homemade by two nice ladies.\\n\\nCons:\\n-It\\'s pricey.  I paid $13.99 for my meal which is very pricey for lunch considering it is not a proper sit-down restaurant. \\n-While I liked the taste of the tofu stir fry, it tasted like the soy protein/bean curd you get at Chinese grocery stores that\\'s pre-cooked.  Also, it was quite oily\\n-For the price, I would have expected to get real cutlery and a real bowl instead of a take out container and an actual coffee cup for soup.\\n-Corn soup, while great flavour seemed to have excess salt.  I had to drink 2 bottles of water and a co\\nffee to clear out the after taste.  \\n\\n\\nVerdict: I think it\\'s good food, nice people, but too pricey and lacks creativity in their dishes for a pure vegetarian meal.  Would visit again, but more like a once every 3-4 months.\\nWhile it may not look like much being inside Galleria Supermarket, WOW delivers on both value, taste and quality.  \\n\\nWe already had a light breakfast, but the aroma coming from this place was so great, I had to order something.  So I got your typical pork bone soup (asked for less spicy) and it came with some banchan (kimchi, seaweed and potato) and purple rice for $6.99 plus tax.  \\n\\nThis PBS was so tasty and meaty and both me and my DC agreed that it was way better than the Owl in Mississauga.  Also, the broth was amazing too.  Not too salty and had a very homey feel. Loved it.\\n\\nVerdict: awesome PBS and great value.  Give it a try if you are within 10 minutes drive.\\nI\\'ve been to three Artisano bakeries in the past few years. One in Oakville, close to where I used t\\no live, one, one in North York where I used to work and this one on Dundas near my mom.  \\n\\nI have to say this is the best one I\\'ve been to for the following reasons:\\n\\n1. The one in Oakville is small and too cramped and gets very loud.  \\n2. The one in North York has very mediocre service and is a bit dirty to me.\\n\\nNow for the good part, this place is big (used to be Lucy\\'s Seafood), service is decent and food is piping hot.  \\n\\nArtisano is the basic quick lunch/breakfast place that is a step above, I\\'d like to say it\\'s a Starbucks with real food or Tim Horton\\'s with much better coffee.  \\n\\nMust try:\\n\\n-Eggs in my pocket or Scrambled Eggs in my pocket - it is like a breakfast panzerotti and it may seem pricy at $7.99, but it comes with a skewer of fruits and enough for two. \\n\\nBest Deal: Freshly baked muffin (a real one unlike the pre-made Tim Horton\\'s or whatever they serve at McDonald\\'s) with a coffee for 2.59.  Best part - free refills!\\n\\nSo-so deals/food: Any of the two item combo\\'s. They', 'actual_label': 19, 'predicted_label': 19}, {'text': ' are okay, nothing to write home about - so that\\'s it - done. \\n\\nBiggest downside - I wish I had one closer to where I live now - Square One area instead of that Panera bread rip-off.\\nI came here for a quick breakfast one day while working from home.  I had their egg crepe plus a warm soy milk.  It was very reasonably priced, ingredients were fresh and the atmosphere is very clean.  \\n\\nThe egg crepe was fluffy and crispy and was cheap at 3.50.  It wasn\\'t big, but made for a good little snack.  I don\\'t you can expect much else for this price.  The soy milk was very good too.  This place is reminiscent of the old Chinese food courts in Chinatown (when they were actually clean and had good quality food for cheap prices) but in a much better atmosphere.\\n\\nVerdict:  Breakfast is decent and may try for lunch soon.  Check it out.\\nOkay, I\\'ve cooled down a bit now.  According to the website, they open at 12, but they didn\\'t open the doors until 12:30.  Strange.  \\n\\nI was the first customer in.  Whi\\nle the waiter was very friendly, he had to switch b/w the kitchen and serving people.  I don\\'t blame him, but rather the owner.  \\n\\nService: 1.5/5  Okay, I still gave this guy a 15% tip, but the overall service was horrible.  They said they were short staffed, so I get it.  But here were my issues:\\n\\na) While it\\'s a family business, the kids should not be running around the restaurant when I enter. Granted, it was just when they opened but when my parents owned a restaurant, we were told to play in the basement and stay out of sight. \\n\\nb) It took 20 minutes for my small soup to arrive.  It took another 5 minutes for my entree to arrive.  If the soup was going to take that long, they should have told me.  \\n\\nc) A non-waiter served me my soup and spilled a portion of it on the table and never cleaned it up.  \\n\\nd) Look at my pictures. I can\\'t eat that without a knife without looking like a pig.  I waited for about 3-4 minutes and no one came out, so I just grabbed my own knife from their cut\\nlery shelf (slightly inside the kitchen).  \\n\\nGranted, they did try to serve dessert to make up for the horribly long wait, but I was in a rush.  I thought worst case scenario, I\\'d be in and out in 40 minutes.  It was like 1 hour and that was with me eating fast.  \\n\\nFood: 2.5/5 meh, nothing special.  Found it underseasoned.  Paratha was not bad.  \\n\\nAmbiance: 1/5 Decor is nice but all the yelling coming from the kitchen is terrible.  Ruined the entire mood.  \\n\\nVerdict: If this were an older restaurant, I\\'d never come back and give them only one star, however I may come back in 1 year from now to see if they worked out the kinks and provide better service.\\nBeing the math nerd that I am, I\\'m going to start this with a lame math joke.  \"Absolute\" in math will turn a negative into a positive and keep a positive positive.  Absolute comedy does exactly that, it will turn a negative mood into a positive mood or if you\\'re already in a good mood, it will  maintain/extend that good mood.  If you u\\nnderstood that joke, then let\\'s have a math party and if you didn\\'t, can I please hang out with you because I want to be as cool as you.  :-)\\n\\nSeriously, here\\'s the breakdown:\\n\\nLikes - much cheaper than Yuk Yuk\\'s and Second City.  Will still keep you laughing. For an entertainment venue, drinks and food aren\\'t totally insane prices.  Food is served relatively fast, as is food and the servers are always walking around to make sure you are satisfied.  \\n\\nDislikes: Not many, but kind of odd how they will take credit/debit for the food, but not for the box office.  Find it odd\\n\\nVerdict: Great cheap night out.\\nI would say 3.5/5 for this.\\n\\nI had a Groupon for this place where I paid approx $10 for $20 worth of food. I ordered the taco sampler which had steak, pork and fish and something else.  \\n\\nThe tacos weren\\'t bad and I thought the presentation was lovely.  It\\'s probably one of the better tacos I\\'ve had in the GTA but not even close to Mexico but WAY WAY WAY better than Taco Bell.  \\n\\nI rea\\nlly enjoyed the steak one.  What I also liked was that they give you so many types of dipping sauce too.  \\n\\nIn addition, this place is gorgeous.  When you drive in, you think you are parking your car into someone\\'s big mansion parking lot with the nice statue and setup.  In addition, inside is beautiful and reminds me of the large restaurants in Mexico City. \\n\\nSo why only 3.5 stars?  \\n\\na) The flies.  I saw some really big flies near my table and had to keep shooing them away. Not the biggest deal, but ruins the experience slightly.\\n\\nb) For the price they charge (even though I had a Groupon), I kind of wish they served nachos.  \\n\\nAt most sit-down Mexican restaurants, I\\'m used to getting nachos.  I was kind of disappointed I didn\\'t get them.  \\n\\nHowever, overall, I\\'d still visit again and try something different.\\nMy friend took me here for a birthday lunch.  We came for their Sunday brunch.  Not a big menu, maybe only 6 or 7 items.  \\n\\nI ordered the Unchicken and Waffles and she ordered th', 'actual_label': 19, 'predicted_label': 19}, {'text': 'e Huevos Rancheros.  I came here based on it being on a tv show and a recommendation of a friend.  The venue is very relaxing and a bit hipster like (i.e. casual tables and servers are in normal clothes).  \\n\\nI usually eat healthy vegan foods and find these absolutely delicious, so I figure deep fried vegan food would be a treat and have amazing taste.  I\\'ve had \"unhealthy\" vegan food as well from places such as Grasshopper and Grasslands.  Sad to say, but the Unchicken and waffles was kind of bland.  Now, I didn\\'t feel sick and it wasn\\'t greasy, but it was very plain.  I honestly would have much preferred a quinoa bowl for some reason. Maybe my taste buds have changed.  However, the collard greens were excellent.  \\n\\nI was able to get a bite of my dining companion\\'s Huevos Rancheros and they were excellent.  It would have tasted even better had their been hot sauce or salsa, but sadly, that was not provided. :-(  \\n\\nVerdict: Meh as a brunch place.  It probably explains why they weren\\'t j\\nam packed at around 12:30 to 1 pm when most brunch places on Bloor are always full with lineups.  Maybe their dinners are better?\\nRead my previous review first.  I really enjoyed the food quality the first time and this time as well.  The service wasn\\'t great the first time but my coworker told me to give it another chance.\\n\\nThis time,however the speed of food coming out is absolutely unacceptable for an ayce restaurant.  It\\'s almost like they purposely serve you slow or are understaffed in the kitchen so that you eat less.  It took a full hour for all our sushi, rolls and kitchen food to come out even though there were only 2-3 tables.  It was very awkward as some people don\\'t want rolls, some don\\'t want sushi and some don\\'t want hot food.  It made for a very uncomfortable lunch.  Also, servers are so frowny.\\n\\nVerdict: not for work lunch and need to be patient.  Never coming back.\\nFirst time I had soon tofu and it was pretty good.\\n\\nPros\\nQuick and efficient service 3.5\\nFriendly wait st\\naff 3.5\\n\\nCons\\nSmall, not much ambiance 2 \\nSmall menu 2\\n\\nNeither pro nor con\\nFood was average, interesting experience but a bit on the salty side.\\n\\nIt\\'s a good place for quick soon tofu but I would have moved if they had Pork bone soup\\n\\nEdit: moved = loved\\nI\\'m quite surprised by all the negative reviews here.  This is a fast food chain for sushi and maybe because I\\'m always in a hurry, I lower my expectations.  \\n\\nHowever, there\\'s a diablo roll which I find absolutely delish.  It has some spicy salmon on top and is well made.  They usually have a express combo and I get that. I do admit at over $10, it is expensive, but fast food is always expensive (i.e. McDonalds combo even cost around $8, so I don\\'t expect sushi to be cheaper).  \\n\\nI also remember having the cherry blossom roll and it is also very good.  However, the other basic rolls like California and avocado are very basic, but it\\'s not bad.  \\n\\nThe miso soup is too salty though and it is from a package (I think).\\n\\nOverall, it\\'s a g\\nreat place if you have a sushi craving, work in the area and need a quick lunch.  Not worth making a special trip, but worth it if you are close by.\\nAh, this is where I used to go when I ditched class in high school (umm..I mean during lunch time...uh..yeah..that\\'s it).  \\n\\nQuiet local mall.  If you are looking for MEXX, American Eagle, Aeropostle type shops and not anything more higher end, this mall will do the job and will be very quiet, so you should get very good customer service.  The mall hasn\\'t really changed over the past 5 years.  Same old shops, same food court, same banks, still has Shoppers and Timothy\\'s coffee. Nothing to write home about, it gets the job done.  \\n\\nLooking for more shopping? Better off driving 15 minutes to Square One or 10 minutes on the highway to Erin Mills town centre.\\nThis used to be a Shopsy\\'s way back when I used to work in the area (about 6-7 years ago).  They\\'ve done a huge renovation and the atmosphere now is quite chic, similar to a Moxie\\'s or an\\n Earl\\'s. \\n\\nService: I came for a Sunday brunch and food was served fairly quickly.\\n\\nFood: Ordered the breakfast burger. It was basically eggs, and panchetta with lettuce and tomato on an omelette.  The taste was exactly what you would expect with eggs, pork and lettuce and tomatoes.  However, what I liked the most was the bun. It was a bit sweet, but very moist.  It was great.\\n\\nVerdict: Will visit again if in the area.\\nA smaller version of Square One, but with ample parking minus the crowds. Nothing special about this mall, but I like their \"Centre Court\" where they sometimes have mini-golf for kids and where Santa Claus is.  \\n\\nThe only weird issue about this mall is that it\\'s kind of confusing.  It\\'s not really a square, not really a circle, but it\\'s more of an octagon shape with some weird intersections, so it\\'s very easy to get somewhat lost.  Not really lost, but sometimes, you end up going all the way around the Centre court, when in reality, the exit where your car is parked was ', 'actual_label': 19, 'predicted_label': 19}, {'text': 'the closest exit lol.\\nHeadline: Coffee that tastes like the original in a hipster vibe for the corporate hipster wanna-be  \\n# of Visits: 1\\nDate of most recent visit before review: 12/24/2013\\n\\nPros: Had a Costa Rican coffee.  I\\'ve been to Costa Rica and it tasted the exact same. It wasn\\'t watered down, but had a nice dark smooth flavour.  So definite points for that.  Also had a great assortment of coffee accessories and they have their own roasting room.  \\n\\nCons: A bit slow.  I was the 3rd person in line and still took about 3-5 minutes to get my drip coffee.  \\n\\nVerdict:  Nice coffee shop with real coffee and makes you appreciate the effort that goes into making coffee.\\nThis is your standard Panera bread.  Nothing special, but it\\'s good for the following:\\n\\n-Breakfast\\n-Wi-fi\\n-Any type of coffee\\n\\nNot good for:\\n-Big groups (booths are a bit crammed)\\n-Lunch (I find the pick 2 ridiculously expensive and very bad value).\\n\\nWhat you should get now: they have a breakfast special where you get a\\nny breakfast item + any espresso/cappucino/latte for $6.99.\\nLocated in Port Credit and next to No Frills, this isn\\'t a bad place to have a coffee.  There is ample seating and the staff is very friendly. It is your standard Second Cup. \\n\\nHowever, there is one big downside and that is you have to ask for the key to use the washroom.  To me, that is very unsanitary and really takes the place down a level, so I have to dock a star for that.\\n\\nOverall though, if you want a quick coffee/tea to go, not a bad choice.\\nThis is a small place and the owners and their son are very friendly.  \\n\\nThey do write that their wassabi has a kick, and it does taste good.  What I don\\'t understand is why they use the wassabi to stick the fish to the rice??!!! \\n\\nI just want to taste the fish and the rice!!!  I want to try again...but don\\'t have the heart to...though it was very reasonably priced.\\nI came here for a Meetup and they graciously shut down the restaurant for our crew of 35 to 40 people.  \\n\\nIt was $25 \\nfor a full three course meal. This is a bit over my budget as my limit is usually $20 before taxes but i have to admit this was great value.  \\n\\nOrder: Mussels in white wine tomato sauce broth (appy), Cajun blackened salmon with fresh fruits on top and veggies on the side (entree) and espresso panna cotta (dessert).\\n\\nLikes:\\n-The white wine tomato sauce broth was delicious.  As my dining neighbour said \"Broth is so good, I\\'m literally licking the bowl\".\\n-Everything was extremely fresh ( and is locally sourced).\\n-Largest portions I\\'ve ever seen for a prix-fixe menu.\\n-They aren\\'t cheap and for the fruit toppings, they give you fancy fruits too such as Dragon fruit.\\n-I\\'m not the best picture taker and my photo\\'s don\\'t do this place justice, but presentation is beautiful.\\n-Service is very friendly.\\n-Open kitchen.  You see all the cooks make all the food in front of you.\\n\\nDislikes:\\n-While the salmon was amazingly fresh, it wasn\\'t spicy enough for blackened food.  \\n\\nYeah that was my only disli\\nke.\\n\\nVerdict: Though it doesn\\'t look like much from the outside, this is definitely one of the better \" fancy food \" places in Toronto and I\\'d visit again.\\nThis new restaurant took the place of Indian Hut, which was an okay restaurant.\\n\\nPros: \\n-I really like the ambiance. It feels very homey yet sophisticated.\\n-They have decent lunch specials for around $10.  Chimchangas, enchiladas and a few other things.\\n-The servers are very nice.  \\n-Free tortilla chips\\n\\nCons: \\n-They\\'ve only been open for a month, and they got a super busy lunch rush and service was slightly slow but still acceptable.\\n-They have vegetarian options but no vegan options. \\n-No appetizers just mostly entrees.  \\n\\nI ordered a chimichanga and it was crispy and tasty.  The side salad that came with it was tasty too.  \\n\\nVerdict: This is more of a 3.5 star but I\\'m rounding up since they are new and to offset the one star from the other review because it\\'s not really deserved considering that person never even went to the rest\\naurant.\\nSo I decided to take an easy walk along the Lakeshore in Port Credit and lo and behond...I found Seasons during the summer (is this a really bad pun??).\\n\\nThis place is small, quaint and cozy, but in a good way.  It\\'s not hustling and bustling (keep in mind, this was around 9:30-10:30 am in the morning on a Sunday) and provides a nice relaxed informal atmosphere...perfect for a Sunday morning. \\n\\nOrdered the eggs Benedict, which were excellent. After watching many episodes of Masterchef US and trying it myself, I am very picky on them (poached eggs need to ooze out the yolk without being under-cooked, English muffin has to be crispy, bacon needs to have the right texture and hollandaise sauce needs to be tasty). Seasons hit all of those notes, so it was perfect.  I also got a coffee and it tasted good too (not sure if it was the relaxed atmosphere - but it was much better than Timmy\\'s).  \\n\\nThe only downside is I\\'m such a cheapskate, so $15 for breakfast is a bit much to me, but i', 'actual_label': 19, 'predicted_label': 19}, {'text': 't was eggs Benedict (that really could be for two people - at least for breakfast) and a coffee.  It\\'s not expensive at all, but I\\'m just cheap.  \\n\\nI\\'ll probably make this my once a month special treat breakfast.   Overall, great spot.\\nI went here because I am always curious about ethnic grocery stores.  It\\'s average.  \\n\\nPros:\\n-nice hot food section\\n-good assortment of olives\\n-nice assortment of fresh fish\\n\\nCons\\n-layout is a bit strange (why is the seating area so far from the hot food area?)\\n-seating area was dirty and not cleaned\\n-prices are average\\n\\nOverall, it seems good for Middle Eastern warm foods, but I can go to Paramount for that and the groceries are average.\\n\\nThe large fish selection is good as well, but it\\'s cheaper at Chinese grocery stores.\\nBest Pho in town?  REALLY?  This is what their sign says outside.  If this is the best pho Toronto has to offer, I\\'ll stick eating my pho in the suburbs.  This place is always packed during lunch time with business types and not many \\npeople who live in the area.\\n\\nI think this is a place where the business types are trying to be cool and hip by having \"Asian food\" even though this place is probably one of the worst pho\\'s I\\'ve ever had.  That\\'s not to say it\\'s bad, it just doesn\\'t compare to 99, Lac Vien, or 88.  The broth is very salty and like Rainie said before me, their meat is always overcooked for a pho place.  Not authentic at all as a lot of the meat in pho is supposed to be slightly cooked and then cooked in the broth itself.  Also, the broth doesn\\'t come steaming hot like it should. It\\'s more just hot.  \\n\\nVerdict: if you want \"fusion\" pho - sure try it out, but if you want authentic - go somewhere else. Ginger is probably better.\\nIf you doo doo on Doo Roo, then I must call you cuckoo.  While walking along Bloor street in Korea Town, I spied with my little eye a sign that said Doo Roo.  Out of pure curiousity, I walked in and saw a nice spacious area that was quite clean.  I took a look at the prices and I t\\nhink they were reasonable.  They seemed slightly more than the other shops in Korea Town, but not a lot.  This place had much better atmosphere so I completely get it.  \\n\\nI ordered the Soon Tofu which is mostly tofu with some seafood and a cracked egg cooking in the soup. It was $7.10 so not as cheap as some other places in the area, but still very reasonable.  However, it was more than worth the price because of the banchan/side dishes you get.  \\n\\n\\nThey gave me 7 side dishes!! It was crazy!\\n\\n1. Some kind of Korean radish pancake - very yummy\\n2. Spied bean curd - decent\\n3. Potato salad - pretty good, but I have no idea what this has to do with Korean food.\\n4. Pickled cucumbers\\n5. Sprouts\\n6. Some kind of green veggie (not seaweed)\\n7. Kimchi - which tasted like it was made in house - very good but not too spicy.  \\n\\nThey also offer free refills on these but I didn\\'t want to be too much of a glutton, so I only asked for more kimchi.  \\n\\nAs for the soon tofu, it was loaded with fresh tofu, w\\nasn\\'t too salty and came with purple rice.  It had a delicate natural flavour without being too overpowering.  Delicious.  \\n\\nAlso, the service was wonderful.  So what did this all come to with tax? $8.00.  Yep. That\\'s it.  What a steal.  \\n\\nVerdict: I\\'m coming back Doo Roo!\\nAlright, so I\\'m not big on breakfast joints because I\\'d rather have a nice breakfast at home and something about paying $15 for eggs and bacon doesn\\'t appeal to me.  However I had a Groupon for it so I was down with that.\\n\\nLikes:\\n-they have freshly squeezed orange juice.\\n-Montreal smoked meat eggs Benny (rare to see) and a very big portion.\\n- very friendly servers. \\n- clean\\n\\nDislikes:\\n-somewhat limited parking at it\\'s in the same complex as a gas station and car wash.\\n\\nOverall, a very solid chain breakfast joint and it is cheaper than Cora\\'s and less greasy than Sunset grill.  Will visit again when I\\'m too lazy to make breakfast.\\n# of Visits: 1\\nDate of last visit before review: 12/28/2013\\n\\n3.5 stars (though I\\'m going\\n to round down to 3 because I don\\';t think it deserves 4)\\n\\n\\nOrdered veggie burger, which was made of fava beans.  It had a nice crisp to it.  What I also liked was that they have a good choice of toppings and it\\'s fully customizeable, which is great.  \\n\\nI think this is a decent burger place and better than your typical Harvey\\'s, McD\\'s, etc, but not super and nothing special.  Of course, I\\'m trying to stick to a primarily pescetarian diet these days, so I didn\\'t have their meat burgers, but I see they have lots of options and they were fairly busy at 3 pm on a Saturday, so that\\'s a good sigh.  Their beef is all fresh, ground in house and halal.  \\n\\nHowever, its worth noting that they have funnel cake (which I\\'ve never had before) and a 15 oz burger.\\n\\nVerdict: If you live close by, eat halal meat, and want funnel cake or if you want a 15 oz burger, this place is right for you.\\nUpdate: Wow, just wow.  The food aroma is so good here and doesn\\'t smell bad unlike some other Indian restaurants', 'actual_label': 19, 'predicted_label': 19}, {'text': ' that are smaller. Don\\'t buy into the hype of Tandoori Flame for a lunch buffet, come here for quality buffet and service instead\\nYou ever see that Seinfeld episode where they go into the soup shop and you have to know what you want or you don\\'t served? I feel like that at A LOT of good Chinese restaurants.\\n\\nWhile Congee Queen isn\\'t that extreme, I feel weird if I don\\'t order within the first 2-3 minutes of sitting down.  We usually get our food within 10 minutes of sitting down and spend the next 20-25 eating it so we are in and out within an hour.  \\n\\nRegardless, I LOVE THIS PLACE!! Cheap, big portions, good portions, fast service (not very talkative) and fairly clean. \\n\\nRecommended Dishes: \\n\\n-Empress Fried Rice (this is Eel fried rice with some other meats and seafoods).  Some of you may not be that adventurous, but this tastes like chicken with a very sweet sauce on top of yeung chow style fried rice.  It\\'s a bit pricey for Chinese restaurant at almost $15, but it\\'s worth it.  \\n\\n-Sa\\nlt N Pepper Squid - ever had golden fried calamari or salt n pepper pork chop? Well mix the two together and this is the flavour you get (btw, no there isn\\'t pork, all squid and it\\'s not round).  \\n\\n-Chili turnip cakes- not too spicy, small kick, but very tasty.  It\\'s not as bad as it sounds (us Chinese really need to learn better marketing skills).  When I talk to my white friends, I say the name and they are like \"eww\" but when they have it, they are like \"OMG, this is so good\".  How can I explain it? Umm...I have no clue..try it..it\\'s GOOD!\\n\\n-Any sizzling plate with meat.  I love sizzling food! Be warned, wash your clothes immediately after or else you\\'ll reek like an old grill.\\n\\nOverall, if you want good food and don\\'t care much for service, go here, because it has seriously good food.\\nI like this Winners, they always seem to have some very nice furniture if you can dig through and it\\'s very cheap sometimes.  You get something that look likes a $200 items for $50.  We\\'ve bought draw\\ners, comforters, bar stools from this place. Granted, they are never in mint condition, but it\\'s very easy to do little touch ups here and there.\\n\\nI\\'ve also recently discovered a gourmet food section, which has jams, oils, marmalades and cookies from Europe and they are fairly fresh as they all have two to three year expiry dates.  It\\'s a little rack, but it\\'s so cute and I can\\'t help but buy these little things because I love trying to be European.  lol.  \\n\\nAlso, this Winners isn\\'t insanely busy, so that\\'s a plus too. All in all, a-OK.\\nI\\'ve come here twice for their Latin nights on Wednesdays (previously know as Azucar Wednesday and now known as Los).  \\n\\nIn terms of the music, it is 70% Bachata, 30% salsa/other and they\\'ll open another Latin/Top 40 room if the crowd dictates.  The floor is decent to dance on as well.  I genuinely enjoy social dancing at this place.  \\n\\nIn addition, paid parking is close by and it is a 2 minute walk from Bay or Yonge/Bloor station. \\n\\nHowever, I have a f\\new problems with this place:\\n\\n1. The bar doesn\\'t accept credit cards and cash only.  That\\'s really messed up.  \\n\\n2. The men\\'s washrooms are terrible.  They are clean but cramped as well.  Both stall doors don\\'t close and the urinals are so tight together, it\\'s awkward.  \\n\\n3. I understand not opening two rooms because it\\'s not a big enough crowd, but when you advertise a top 40/reggaeton room and a salsa/bachata room, you definitely should open both rooms as it is two different types of crowd. One crowd that enjoys social dancing and less drinking and another crowd that\\'s more there just to party and drink.  \\n\\nOverall, I would go back to this place, but I just wish they could fix #1 and somehow #2.\\nWe ordered takeout for a going away party from this place.  They delivered within 30 minutes (which shouldn\\'t be hard considering our office is a 5 minute walk away), and ordered some party pizzas.  They are much better than Pizza Pizza.  Not salty and the crust doesn\\'t feel doughy.  I really\\n liked their veggie and chicken pizza, which had some kind of basil and pesto.  \\n\\nAt this point, probably my fave pizza joint in Yorkville.\\nThis place has a very high quality of the food.  \\n\\nBlack cod dinner is a good size and bento box B has a great assortment of food.  The sashimi is very fresh and the black cod has a slight hint of sweetness which is cooked perfectly.   In the words of my friend \"the black cod was awwwwwwwwwesome!\"\\n\\nThe atmosphere is also quaint and cute. I would give this place 5 stars for quality and atmosphere but it is a bit on the pricy side. Still worth it for a great experience.\\n\\nThis is definitely a great date place or taking out visitors from out of town.\\nOkay, tried something different this time.   I actually had to go back two times because they mixed up my order.  One day I ordered a large shrimp burrito and they gave me steak accidentally.  I was already home so I didn\\'t feel like returning it. I called them and they said sorry and offered me a free shr', 'actual_label': 19, 'predicted_label': 27}, {'text': 'imp burrito next time.\\n\\nWell, the steak was rely good and very well seasoned, much better than the haddock.\\n\\nAs for the shrimp, it was very good.  What I really liked about it (besides being free lol), was that used large prawn type shrimp as opposed to the small ones that other fast food establishments.  It was great value,\\nWeird, but great.  Love the patio.  It\\'s odd, but beautiful even though you are staring at warehouse buildings.  \\n\\nOrdered lamb sandwich - excellent though kinda pricey at 8.99.  Included two huge pita bread with no dipping sauce, appreciate it but what are two people supposed to do with those huge pieces of bread when they both ordered sandwiches/shawarmas?\\n\\nOh well, it\\'s good, will try again later.\\nYou are what you eat.  I ate sausage. So I\\'m a pig.  Actually I really am because after going to one food truck in Celebration Square, I went to the one next to it.  It was $9 for the sausage.  I liked the crispiness of the bun (i\\'m one of those people who when they ha\\nve a hot dog, that the bun must be put on the grill, so it\\'s crispy and toasty!), however the sausage was very average.  For a place that specializes in sausages, I would expect a bit more flavour and their \"gourmet sauce\" tasted like standard burrito sauce.  The sausage tasted like I could have bought those pre-cooked sausages from a grocery store and just heated it up.  \\n\\nThe only redeeming thing about this food truck was that they had Boylan soda and I\\'ve been craving that for a couple of weeks now.  :-)\\nThis festival is in it\\'s 2nd year and still in it\\'s infancy.  \\nIf you follow Canadian comics, these aren\\'t no namers either.  The headliners for opening night were Mike Bullard (from Open Mike) and Frank Spadone.  \\n\\nHowever, there were 3-4 other Canadian comics who were also amazing.  The best one was definitely Darcy Michaels.  I think he got the most laughs.  \\n\\nSo the review breakdown:\\n\\nProduct (the show): 5/5 - hilarious.  I think my throat hurts and larynx hurts from all that la\\nughing.  \\n\\nAtmosphere/Venue:  4/5 - while these are somewhat makeshift venues, the comics, the event organizers make it work.  Being in a church laughing at dirty jokes is awkward, yet adds to the hilarity and uniqueness of the festival.  Some of the other nights are at the Royal Canadian Legion and Clarke Memorial Hall.  However, I have to say the acoustics were pretty good.  The only slight issue was the chair setup because it would be hard to see the entire stage if someone is bigger than you.  \\n\\nPricing: Tickets showed $45 advance/$50 at the door for opening night for 3 hours of comedy.  That\\'s a steal, considering the quality of comedians.  Other tickets showed $26 advance/$30 door for other shows, which is equivalent to that of local stand up comedy clubs, but these guys are real pro\\'s.   \\n\\nVerdict: WORTH IT!.\\nThis place is located within a health store called Noah\\'s (way at the back).  They have a good size \"buffet\" bar where you pay by weight plus soups, wraps and some snacks. \\n The buffet bar is $2.60/100g which is average by Toronto standards, but pricey by mine.  However, the food is quite good and seems to be prepared daily and very fresh.  They have an assortment of salads, cabbage rolls, tofu and lentil inspired dishes.  I\\'ve tried their hot dishes twice and also had a samosa.  While I loved the food, the problem is that it isn\\'t very warm or piping hot and the samosa I had was practically frozen and no offered to warm it up for me.  \\n\\nI might visit again, but only if I\\'m passing by.  It\\'s great takeout food, not necessarily food you want if you want to eat something there before a workout or something.\\nI think some of the reviewers are being too harsh here, but I kind of get it.  When you think \"steak and cheese\", you think greasy goodness.  This is quite the opposite.  It\\'s fresh beef, natural ingredients and not greasy at all.\\n\\nPersonally, I really like that. I get sick after eating too much grease and this was the first time I had a steak and cheese\\n without feeling bloated after.  I found it quite tasty.  \\n\\nThe guy working the cash was very friendly too (who I think was the owner).  My only qualm is that i found the fries a bit soggy and they could have been crispier.  However, I told him that and he just said \"thank you, next time tell us you want it crispy\".  So I really appreciate that.\\n\\nVerdict: Decent lunch spot.\\nSurprisingly nice atmosphere in a run down mall and plaza.  This is a ma and pa store, with a European owner.  I really like these kind of shops because you can tell they really care about the food quality.  \\n\\nThis is not fast food, this is a sit, enjoy your breakfast type of place, like a coffee shop with good food. I ordered #52, which was 2 eggs, sausage (or bacon), cheese in a large crepe that comes with fresh fruit.  The crepe itself had a soft, crispy nature (does that make any sense?)..what I mean is soft but with a bit of crispiness, so I think that\\'s a good thing.   \\n\\nI went very early, so I was the first c', 'actual_label': 19, 'predicted_label': 19}, {'text': 'ustomer, and there weren\\'t any people after me, which made me feel bad because the owner was very nice, so I encourage people to try this out.  Also, while coffee isn\\'t amazing, it\\'s still very good (better than Tim Horton\\'s).  \\n\\nAs for the atmosphere, clean and modern, so it seems like a good place for people to hang out and chit chat.  \\n\\nI think I will return, but the downside is I work in Toronto and want crepes for breakfast, but they don\\'t open until 9 am and I\\'m downtown by 7:30 a.m.  Maybe another weekend breakfast spot?\\nI came here a few weeks ago with a friend.  I didn\\'t have their pho as I couldn\\'t find any vegetarian options (they had pho with vegetables but wasn\\'t in their vegetarian section so I assume it was probably made with meat broth).\\n\\nI ordered the Chinese vegetables with stick noodles.  It tasted okay, but I found there was too much gravy and the noodles weren\\'t dried out properly so it was really wet and the noodles were very soft.  \\n\\nWhat I did like about this pl\\nace was that it was one of the cleaner and better decorated pho places I\\'ve seen.\\n\\nVerdict: The food is average, but decor is good and ambiance is nice.\\nTLDR: Come here before 11 am and it is probably the cheapest Shanghai style restaurant in the GTA. Dumplings as low as $0.99 and buns are $1 each before 11 am. \\n\\n$23.67 - this was my bill before tips but including taxes.  It included the following:\\n1. Corn congee - $1\\n2. Xiao long bao (4) - $1\\n3. Xiao long bao with crab meat (4) - $1.99\\n4. Pan Fried Xiao long bao (4) - $2.99\\n5. 2 steamed veggie buns - $1 each\\n6. 1 steamed veggie bun - $1 each \\n7. Jelly pork or something - $3.99\\n8. Noodle bowl with bean curd - $5.99\\n\\nWe had no idea about their specials and arrived at around 10:45 and just furiously ordered random specials. \\n\\nFrom what I gather the 0.99 Xiao long bao were the best values since you get 4 dumplings and also the best tasting. They also looked like they had a lot of soup in them and the skin was very thin.  The steamed buns \\nhad a nice thick, but not too thin wrapping and the veggie bun was filled with preserved veggies.  \\n\\nWhile the noodle bowl with bean curd for $5.99 was the most expensive, the noodles weren\\'t your typical thick Shanghai or udon noodles, nor were they ramen. The best way to describe it is a thicker vermicelli, not really al dente, but not soggy either.  The bean curd had a great flavour to it, as did the broth.  \\n\\nIn terms of the pricing, items 1 to 6 listed above were the pre 11 am specials.  All the XLB (xiao long bao) pricing is for the first. If you order more, then you pay $1 more (i.e. normal XLB would be $1.99 for every order thereafter).  However, all the buns and congee are $1 each and you can order as much as you want. \\n\\nThe only thing severely lacking is service.  We had to call the waitresses a few times and while they were busy, we still got our food. The only thing is that when we had to wait for a table, they would say the number in Mandarin only and not Cantonese or Engl\\nish which got me really nervous that we\\'d be waiting for seats for a while.  \\n\\nVerdict: Very good food, plenty of vegetarian dishes at super cheap prices as long as you are willing to put up with sub-par service.  Will visit again.\\nSo I\\'m not super big into frozen yogurt, but I do find it refreshing at times. \\n\\nLikes:\\n-Everything is organic\\n-GMO free\\n-The fruit toppings are very fresh and none of that frozen garbage.  The lychees and kiwi\\'s were so fresh and absolutely delicious. \\n-Free samples.\\n\\nDislikes:\\n-It\\'s a bit more expensive than YoYo\\'s at $0.65/oz vs. $0.55/oz.  While that doesn\\'t seem like much, if you buy 10 oz, it\\'s a $1.00 difference.  However, you get what you paid for.\\n\\nVerdict: Good fro-yo place while you do your shopping in Square One.\\nThis place is a hidden gem.  When you think of the places at Hwy 5 and Hwy 10, you think of good food in a dive.  This place is the complete opposite.\\n\\na) There is a parking lot in the back and it\\'s not as cramped as all the other one\\'s \\nat the 5/10 intersection.  \\n\\nb) It\\'s nicely decorated and has a bit of class to it. It feels like somewhere you could take a date or have a nice family meal. \\n\\nc) Owner and server are friendly.  \\n\\nd) They have exotic juices. E.g. I\\'ve been looking to replicate my soursop juice experience from Costa Rica for a few years now and couldn\\'t.  This place actually uses ripened soursop pulp from Colombia as opposed to the shipped ones here which is actually a benefit. You can actually taste the combination of sour and sweetness that comes from fresh soursop.  \\n\\nAs for the food itself, I was really hungry so I had:\\n\\n1) Empanada app (3 small ones for $4.50)\\n2) The special of the day, which included Sopa de avena (\"oat soup\" - but it really is  like a hearty chicken and vegetable soup) and a beef dish with salad, rice, and plantain for $10.99\\n\\nThe empanada\\'s were stuffed to the brim, hot and crispy and the salsa they served with it was pretty good.\\n\\nThe soup was light yet hearty at the same time.', 'actual_label': 19, 'predicted_label': 19}, {'text': 'me confused there for a lifetime while he put away dog food who finally helped me. Oh hey, bud! What took\\'ya so long? \\n\\nNow, I can\\'t gripe too much because they do offer obedience classes for about $109 for 6 weeks. This pays for you to come in once a week to work with your pup. That sounds like a good deal to me, but I\\'m not really sure what else it out there. Is that good or bad? Who knows...\\n\\nMy favorite part of this trip (which cost me $50 for a stuffed animal and a discounted leash/collar) was the interaction I had with the guy at the cash register. I\\'m under the impression this guy was not only having the worst day of his life, but also hungover and maybe experiencing a migraine at the same time. Holy-mother-of-GOD. This was the most uncomfortable moment of my life. It was like every thing I did and every move he made was this painful inconvenience for him. I wanted to give him a cookie or something to make his day better. Either that or donate a hundred dollars to his cause. \\n\\nI\\n managed to help him eek out a smile before I left, but that was pretty much the most miserable checkout experience of my life. \\n\\nOh, they have healthy dogs foods. So, yeah, that\\'s cool. Just a note: I don\\'t think all PetCo\\'s are like this, but I do believe that Steelyard in general needs to get it\\'s life together.\\nTake out or dine in, these ladies know what\\'s up when it comes to authentic Mexican yummies. \\n\\nAnd by ladies I mean the last time I ate there the owner and her daughter actually came to our table to make sure everything was delicious! We ordered too much food and couldn\\'t eat it all (pretty big portions here, folks)--they noticed and were worried we didn\\'t enjoy ourselves. On the contrary! We were gluttonous and left full and happy. But I appreciated the attention--and the fact that they offered to take some of the food off our bill, which we politely declined--after reassuring them everything was awesome, of course.\\n\\nThis is not a fancy restaurant by any means. It\\'s definit\\nely a little \"hole-in-the-wall\" ish, but not nearly as bad as some of the diners I\\'ve been to. Sometimes your arms stick to the tables or the menus, but the food makes up for it. Also, I hear some complaints about the area, but I\\'ve never had a problem. \\n\\nMy guy swears by their chicken taquitos, but I\\'m always trying something different. Their chicken burrito is great, I love their salsa and really I haven\\'t had anything I didn\\'t like here. Take out orders are usually ready in under 15 mins. And some might gripe about only one or two free baskets of chips and salsa before they charge you, but come on. Think about what you\\'re complaining about. I\\'m sure you\\'ll see you sound silly. Two FREE large portions are more than enough, and it\\'s not like they have that limited for large parties. \\n\\nAlso.. they have a parking lot. Free, ample parking is such a nice luxury!\\nWhen my boyfriend (LV native) and I first cooked up the idea to spend my 30th birthday in Vegas, a stop at Roberto\\'s was the fir\\nst thing he mentioned we HAD to do. \\n\\nI mean--he was so serious, you guys. Feasting on their chicken tacos was a must--as many times as possible while we were there. Boy am I glad my boyfriend has great taste, because Roberto\\'s changed my life. And from his expression as we gobbled down this authentic, Mexican goodness, I could tell they tasted just the same as he remembered. \\n\\nFirst, it\\'s cheap and it\\'s fast--but the portions and the quality of the food will knock your face off. \\n\\nSecond, get yourself some chicken tacos. As many other Yelpers mentioned, their all-white-meat chicken is shredded perfection. It isn\\'t seasoned to all hell, just ever so slightly, so you can still taste the chicken. And yea, it\\'s greasy--but it\\'s because they deep fry those suckers fresh in front of you. Ermahgerd. And if you really want to taste it as it should be, just get shredded cheese and lettuce on \\'em. That\\'s it. Then top it with some of their delicious, homemade hot sauces. It\\'s everything that\\'s r\\night in the world. And if one form of shredded chicken and cheese, deep-fried in a fresh tortilla isn\\'t enough, then please let me recommend their taquitos!  We get them with just cheese melted on top with a scoop of their homemade guacamole. Perfection in crunchy, gooey, food form. \\n\\nRoberto\\'s tacos are a Vegas must-try. Just ask the folks who live there or grew up there--they\\'ll point you in the right direction. And I trust me some locals (and Yelpers!)\\nA very cute little locally owned cafe, but not much to back it up. It\\'s quite unfortunate too, because they have a beautiful stone patio to chill on and the owner is awesome.\\n\\nI hate saying this, but when you order a large coffee the cup should be filled. What my BF got was a 60% filled cup and that is unacceptable. There was no signage or information about the coffee they used and the brew was very weak. It just doesn\\'t have the convenience factor for a professional to grab some joe on the go. Plus, I couldn\\'t connect to the WiFi and', 'actual_label': 20, 'predicted_label': 20}, {'text': \" the employees have to give you the password.\\n\\nThe food we ordered was just not good either. Tuna melts do not need to be caked in mayo--but I feel like NEO doesn't understand this in general. There was hardly any tuna meat on the sandwich and the portion was super small. \\n\\nI give this place two stars because I feel like there is some positive and there is a ton of potential. It's barely 4 months old and they're building out the inside for more seating in the colder months. I think they could really do well if they utilize some local ingredients to step up their lunch game. There really is no room for in Cleveland anymore for Sysco food--especially with the national culinary attention we've been getting. \\n\\nI really do wish this cafe nothing but the best, but they can't keep going down the same path they're going down now.\\nI'm back at 3-stars for my final update of Panda Wok, and here's why...\\n\\n1) They delivery sushi that doesn't suck. \\n2) They never forget chopsticks when you order sus\\nhi (but they often do if you order anything other than sushi, so always ask.)\\n3) They have yet to forget all my specifications when I make orders (i.e. no fish roe, extra-crunch, no onions in the lo mein, etc.) \\n4) Again, they take credit card payment.\\n\\nAnd lastly, even if they just make it, delivery times are hardly ever longer than they tell you. I think it's worth noting that sushi takes longer than their other items. I find that strange since there's cooking involved with their other menu. I guess it takes longer to roll sushi than it does to cook like 3-4 entrees.\\nI go to this Rite Aid because it's close to my house--but that's just about the only positive about this location. \\n\\nWell, I take that back. They sell cheap wine and are open later than the surrounding grocery stores and wine shops. Unfortunately I haven't found a wine elf to deliver the goods right to my house, so finding a store that's open late for purchasing is muy importante. Oh, and when a stray pup followed us in \\none time the shift manager kept him in the break room while we called for help. But that's about it. \\n\\nThere are a few reasons why this location continues to fail: \\n\\n1) Lazy, slow as molasses staff. I've never experienced a pharmacy, drive thru and checkout this.frickin.slow in my life! I truly don't understand this.\\n\\n2) There's *always* some snafu with my Rx. It never runs smoothly. \\n\\n3) A call-in refill that would take any other pharmacy an hour takes them 4. Seriously? \\n\\n4) Each and every time I've come to this location I fear for my life. I know it will get held up at gun point eventually while I'm there... it's just a toss up of when. The people who creep around this location are terrifying. Then they come inside and float around like zombies. I get crass things yelled at me anytime I walk up to the door and when I leave the store. It's just a hot mess. \\n\\nI'm beginning to think it might be worth the extra drive else where.\\nLet's get something straight before you read on: I don't g\\nolf. This review isn't about golf. And yes, I realize I'm reviewing a golf course. \\n\\nHowever--it's winter in NEO and that means one thing: SLEDDING! This is one of our favorite, family-friendly places to sledd in the snowy months. Why? There's a pretty large hill with some dips that will make your stomach drop. And there's a smaller hill, perfect for young sledders just getting the hang of things. It's always packed with kids accompanied by parents, which is a huge plus. Everytime we go Edgewater, it's fun, but there are so many unsupervised kids--it's just too dangerous for a little one. \\n\\nBut, I'd say for kids 10 and under, this place is the perfect sledding location. We've even taken our dog and I've seen others with their pups, too! \\n\\nNo frilly stuff, no lodge, just hills and snow. \\n\\nCan't wait to come back to try some snowshoe action and maybe even some cross country skiing--both available down in the Metroparks!\\nHmmm... maybe the last reviewer came in on an off day, or something \\nbecause my experience with Classic Connection Restoration was completely different. \\n\\nAs in fan-freakin-tastic. \\n\\nI've been a frantic mess lately trying to figure out the *real* issue with my check engine light before my tags expire. One place would tell me it was the converter and that I needed to replace the whole thing, plus both oxygen sensors. The next would tell me they could fix the converter with a universal fit part, but mark it up to $600+ my arms, legs and first-born child. \\n\\nI actually walked into Classic Connection about something completely different. See, I came home from a work trip to find my side mirror shattered. My boyfriend had just had the entire backside of his Jeep reconstructed here for a super fair price. Plus, they were one of the only places who didn't turn him away! I came in to see what they could do with my mirror and told them about my other horror stories. He looked up parts right in front of me, told me prices and fixed my car for a phenomenal price. \\n\", 'actual_label': 20, 'predicted_label': 20}, {'text': '\\nBeyond that? Well, turns out they ran a diagnostic test on my car and couldn\\'t find anything wrong with my converter. Therefore, they did not charge me for extra parts, labor or time they didn\\'t need to spend. Additionally, they cleaned up my headlights to look brand new and fixed my side mirror for like $50 (part included.) \\n\\nI\\'ll for sure be back to get some other areas of my car fixed up, especially some under guards before winter. These guys are nice, fast and honest. That\\'s hard enough to find in just a regular mechanic, let alone a body shop. \\n\\nI\\'m not sure what the other yelper experienced, but both my boyfriend and I can vouch for this business from two different experiences. We\\'d totally recommend this place to anyone in Cleveland who needs body work.\\nThis coming from someone who doesn\\'t like sweets all that much: Pour that homemade, warm, caramel sauce on me and call me Sally, baby.\\n\\nSweet mother of \"Moses\" this place is derrricious. \\n\\nNostalgia out the tush for a new founta\\nin shop? A little tricky, but they nailed it. I felt like I was transported back to a simpler time when ice cream cured all, no matter what the problem. Oh wait... it still does? Well it does here. \\n\\nI\\'m a simple creature--one who appreciates simple flavors. I ordered a single scoop of house-made vanilla ice cream and warm caramel sauce. ZOMG--perfection. You know how warm caramel get\\'s chewier against the cold ice cream? I\\'m drooling right this second. \\n\\nJason got the Gordon Square which featured a homemade brownie, hot chocolate and caramel sauce and their special bananas foster ice cream. All I can say is that afterwards, he said he could spend a weekend there eating everything and not get sick of it. And the boy? Well they made him a special rootbeer float that they don\\'t normally make since he was good at school that week. Umm, you win my loyalty if you\\'re good to the kids. \\n\\nI have a funny feeling we\\'ll be spending a lot of time here this summer. Oh, and it\\'s the perfect \"bring y\\nour out-of-town-visitors\" kind of place too.\\nMy first trip to Number One Pho left me happy with a belly full of warm goodness on a cold night. But it also left me troubled... do I really have to choose? Can\\'t I love both Number One Pho and Superior Pho?! WAH! \\n\\nIn my opinion, these two restaurants serve two different kinds of pho. Superior\\'s broth packs a big punch with spices. Number One\\'s broth hangs out in the background with a much milder flavor. At Superior I stick with just brisket because I found their regular beef pho a little chewy. But at Number One their regular beef cuts were super-tender and tasty--no brisket needed. In fact, with their lighter broth and super-skinny rice noodles (think angel hair-esque) they really let the meat of this soup dish shine. While Superior Pho\\'s broth really takes over all other flavors. \\n\\nI liked...\\n... that it wasn\\'t super busy and we could just come in, sit down and be served without the hassle of huge crowds or waiting\\n... that our pho was \\nserved within mere minutes of ordering it, pipping hot--beef perfectly prepared\\n... that it looked a little more like a restaurant, a lot cleaner and less scary than it\\'s competitor\\n... the thinner pho noodles were a great change of pace! \\n... that it was easy to find and get into. Better than a hidden maze through other businesses.\\n\\n\\nI didn\\'t like...\\n... that it was so dead I was wondering if something was wrong with this place! \\n... that there was no Sriracha or hoisin bottles on the tables for you to use yourself. Instead they give you a small bowl with both condiments pre-rationed for you. I want to make my own call on how much I use. \\n... the measly one plate of fixings for two orders of pho. Each person should either get their own plate, or a much larger portion for two \\n\\nTo sum it up, it\\'s going to be really tough to choose now between these two neighboring competitors. So maybe I\\'ll just make whoever I\\'m dining with choose instead.\\nI\\'ve read the other reviews--I\\'m still not sur\\ne how I had a completely different experience than those who had a bad stay. But here\\'s all I know...\\n\\nThank godness for Aloft! My colleagues come into town pretty often and after staying in cool, boutique hotels around the country, not having one in our downtown area was a bummer. Aloft has set the new standard for \"stay\" in Cleveland. Modern, chic, fun and posh without the huge pricetag. Don\\'t get me wrong, there are some gorgeous, old hotels downtown, but that type of hotel doesn\\'t always fit what you\\'re looking for--and they\\'re ususally over-priced or a 15 minute drive over to the east side of Cleveland.\\n\\nThe decor is on point--it\\'s new construction on the new east bank of the Flats, so it still has that new smell. The lobby makes you feel like you\\'re somewhere else on vacation or something. A really cool experience. When I walked in, I immediately felt proud that it\\'s now here in Cleveland. The lobby transistions into the hotel bar and lounge, w xyz.

Do yourself a favor and check out the balcony, grab a drink and watch the trains go by. \\n\\nOur room facing the Browns Stadium, so we were not bothered by any train noises, etc. I didn\\'t hear doors slamming, nothing. It was a very peaceful night of sleep. The windows are huge and some face the new Ernst & Young building, so just make sure you utilize those blinds. The space wasn\\'t huge, but it wasn\\'t super small, either. The bathroom had all those modern, cool touches you\\'d expect from a W Hotel and there was some unique storage. Overall the decor of the room was super minimal, almost a little cold, but comfortable. \\n\\nThe location is obviously close to so, so much to do in Cleveland, so you\\'re all set there. You really can\\'t loose. I had zero issues with valet, parking, etc. Awesome food and nightlight options if you don\\'t want to even leave the building--win.\\nThis is a good option for delivery pizza with a savory\\n sauce and chewy crust. \\n\\nNormally we\\'re Angelo\\'s Pizza people, but you get sick of eating the same take-out pizza all the time, right? Plus, while I enjoy Angelo\\'s, it\\'s rare that I like bakery-style, deep dish pie like that with sweet sauce. Also, the past few times we\\'ve been the last stop on their delivery route. And you know what that means? Luke-warm, congealed cheese pizza. Yuck. I know they\\'re trying to save time, but I want hot pizza. \\n\\nPapa Nick\\'s helps us with hot delivery pizza because we\\'re so close. Is it the most amazing pizza I\\'ve ever had? No. But it\\'s a better delivery option for us, as stated above. \\n\\nOne thing I\\'m not a huge fan of though is how much more expensive Papa Nick\\'s is compared to Angelo\\'s. I believe there is a delivery fee, as well.\\nI can\\'t believe that as a life long Clevelander this was the first year that I\\'ve made it to this super-fun event! \\n\\nThese Tall Ships sail in from all over the world and people actually live on them for the entire summer--I m\\nean, just imagine trying to shave your face on a boat? Ha! The vessels themselves are awe inspiring, huge and take you back to a historical time when cannon balls were sent soaring through the air and pirates captured ships. Wait... pirates still do that? Well, OK then. \\n\\nIf you\\'ve got some extra coin (an extra $45 to be exact) you can actually take a ride on one of these bad boys, but otherwise, you\\'ll pay $14/adult to stand in lines, waiting for chance to explore about 10 of \\'em, big and small. My favorite was the Norwegian ship which hosted a year long school program where seniors in high school go abroad traveling to ports all over the world and learn. Pretty neat stuff! \\n\\nBeyond that, there\\'s a few entertainment-like shows, live music, St. Edwards drum line, face painters, magicians and other miscellenous performances to keep you busy around the boats. There were plently of food options, ranging from both healthy (sugar-free lemonade, kabobs, grilled chicken) to unhealthy (typical\\n carnival foods, kettle corn, soft pretzels and smoothies.) Occasionally you could find a beer or two--but all of the above was priced at premium festival prices. You know... $6 for a half lemon, ice, sugar and water mixed in a cup and called lemonade. But I think most people expect that much.\\n\\nNow that I\\'ve actually paid to get into the Festival, instead of just watching it from afar, I don\\'t know if I\\'d pay the prices to come again. But it was worth going once and I had a blast. Plus, if you\\'re into taking pictures, there were plently of photo opps to keep your artisitc eye snapping.\\nInsta-meh as soon as we walked in the door. \\n\\nWith all the build up about this place, I couldn\\'t believe how disappointed I was with Empress Taytu. It was completely empty inside when we arrived, so I\\'m not entirely sure why 1) our dinner took 2 1/2 hours and 2) we were the first people there, but the last to leave. \\n\\nI will say that maybe I\\'m just not a big fan of Ethiopian cuisine, but typically I can \\nforgive lack luster food when the ambiance and service are amazing. This was not the case tonight. Although, since this was my first experience I\\'m not ready to judge all Ethiopian off this visit. \\n\\nAlso, we did have a pretty tasted appetizer that was similar to an Indian samosa. I just wish I was as pleased with the rest of my meal. My bill was really high and I barely touched my food. The \"womp\" elf has definitely struck.\\nEvery time I walk into Chelsea\\'s I have to convince myself that if I get lost, someone will find me. But you know what? I\\'m not 100% sure they would. \\n\\nI know that vintage shops are usually like a maze of mish-moshed items typically grouped by men\\'s or women\\'s clothing, housewares and knick knacks. I\\'m prepared for the cluster and over whelming feeling when I walk in. \\n\\nChelsea\\'s is different. You still get that \"feeling\" at first, but then you realize how über organized everything is. I mean by decade, theme, fabric styles--you name it.

You can head over here and rent something from their ginormous collection for a couple of weeks. Simple as that! They\\'ve got everything from wigs, hats, shoes and other accessories. A true one-stop shop!\\n\\nAs for me? Well, I stopped by looking for a costume for a Hollywood/Red Carpet themed party. I had no idea what I was looking for besides that I wanted to be \"old glam.\" These ladies pointed me in the right direction and even searched through their favorite dresses to find me something perfect. I left with a red, sequenced dress with a slit--ala Jessica Rabbit/ Betty Boop. Can\\'t wait to put it all together and be a little 1920\\'s-esque starlet!\\nI tend to \"eat with my eyes first.\" \\n\\nTo clarify, my eyelid\\ns don\\'t have teeth. But you know what I mean. These French pastries are not only divine in taste, but visually stunning. \\n\\nYesterday I planned a French-themed, day-date to celebrate my mother\\'s existence (thanks for being born Mom!) She just got back from visiting Paris and Bordeaux, so I figured a stop at the very popular Coquette Patisserie was the perfect way to begin our day. And, if anything, we could find out if these macarons were truly the real deal--as most NEO versions I\\'ve tried have been crunchy atrocities. \\n\\nErmahgerd. These are the real thing--FINALLY! I watched my mom\\'s face light up as she bit into the first of the 4 flavors we tried. I joined in with equal delight as she exclaimed, \"Cara--these are just like they are in France!\" And while I\\'ve never traveled overseas to try them in person, I know to expect a chewy, soft, light cookie that blends well with the decadent filling. These were perfect.  \\n\\nWe also enjoyed some French press coffee, a raspberry sponge cake with\\n pistachio filling and a lemon tart. I\\'m not a big lemon dessert fan... or really a dessert fan at all. These treats are the exception. The raspberry cake was moist layers of cake, a layer of pistachio in the center and it was life-changing. The lemon tart was the perfect balance of fresh, tart, sweet and refreshing.  \\n\\nI do have some minor criticisms--mostly service related. And keep in mind that they didn\\'t change the fact that the product and vibe of Coquette is 5-star, period. \\n\\nWe came in at 10:30AM knowing they opened at 10AM and hoping that would be efficient time for them to be set up and organized for the day. They were still not at 10:35. There were hardly any pastries in the case. No savory items were available. The gal at the counter looked like she had just got there and was still stocking the case. If you\\'re telling the community you\\'re open at 10AM, I don\\'t think it\\'s smart to be scrambling 35 minutes afterwards without your FULL stock in place. This was our first experi\\nence here and that wasn\\'t a great first impression. She was nice enough, but we felt like we were bothering her by asking questions. We got snappy responses like, \"this is all we have\" when I asked about any savory options. And a mere 10 minutes after being seating, we saw her bring out an entire tray tarts and quiches. Knowing that we wanted those, she could have mentioned that they would be ready in 10 minutes--especially since she knew we were dining in. There is such time, effort and care put into making all their pastries so perfect. It would be nice of some of that was also translated and shown through their service.\\nThis is a tough review to write because the girls who helped us were dolls, but this place needs to step it up a notch on just a couple of fronts....\\n\\n1) Although the girl who did my sister\\'s pedi and gel mani was the sweetest ever (and did a great pedicure)--when a client calls and makes an appointment for a gel mani SPECIFICALLY, you don\\'t give them someone who has\\n never done one before. Period. My sister, although ultimately happy with the result, had her nails redone about 4 times. The girl who was helping her did everything she could to make sure that when my sister left, her gel mani was right, but still... poor form. \\n\\n2) When I came in I told them the design I wanted on my nails, they told me they could do it. They couldn\\'t. In fact, they have one girl there who can do nail art the way it\\'s supposed to be done. That\\'s it. And she wasn\\'t there. My gal ( I will not share her name because I don\\'t want her connected to a so-so review. She\\'s great!) just couldn\\'t get the help and support she needed. She could do some nail art, but there was NO ONE there to help her with what she couldn\\'t do. She tried two different methods to get my nails done and just couldn\\'t get it. I felt awful for her--but I also was getting really upset. By the time we left we had been there about 3.5 hours. That\\'s WAY tooo long. I had things to do and I had not planned o', 'actual_label': 20, 'predicted_label': 20}, {'text': 'n more than 1.5hrs, which is more than enough for your standard pedi and gel mani. \\n\\n3) I also watched them turning away multiple walk-in clients when their signage outside clearly stated \"walk-ins welcome.\" That could seem like a positive to some, but to me I saw two customers leaving with a horrible taste in their mouths... it was visible on their faces. If I were the business owner, I WOULD NEVER want any employee of mine to treat a potential customer that way. There are so many ways to remedy that situation. But if I were a business owner, I\\'d offer any walk-in client who couldn\\'t be served anytime that day a discount on their next service. But that\\'s just me. \\n\\nNow on to the positives, which there are plenty. The space itself is large and very clean. Each pedicure station looked freshly cleaned--all with signage assuring you so. Their gel nail color selection is one of the best and most updated I\\'ve seen around. You\\'ll have a hard time choosing most certainly. They have a simple a\\nnd moderately priced pedicure, but be careful what you say \"yes\" to as it will add extra charges. They have varying scented lotions you can pick from for your pedicures and the pedi\\'s themselves look great. My gel manicure, although not entirely what I wanted, was a well-done manicure-- and my sister\\'s was too, after 4 tries.\\nHell-to-the-yes.\\n\\nThey\\'ve upgraded to working gas pump credit card readers! That brings One Stop up a star, methinks. Plus, their prices aren\\'t too outrageous in comparison to the rest of the stations around Ohio City. \\n\\n\\nThe creepy factor? Still going strong. Although, I think over time I\\'ve come to accept this and deal with it. Hopefully that doesn\\'t work against me... *currently knocking on wood*\\nSo far this place seems like your average, American-Chinese restaurant with its deliciously greasy take-out and fried staples. But where this place really shines is in its delivery service, hours and swiftness! \\n\\nI\\'ve only had the wonton soup, vegetable fried rice and \\ncrab rangoon--all of which was average, yet tasty. Each item required a bit more soy sauce and hot sauce from me, but I\\'m a sodium/spice-o-holic. My beau thought everything was tasty enough without additions. I agree with some of the other Yelpers who mentioned the crab rangoons could use a bit more filling, but you can\\'t complain too much about deep fried goodness. \\n\\nI would love to see some chopsticks in the bag, if it\\'s not too much to ask. I also thought it was strange that they sent saltine cracker packets for the wonton soup. Ha. I\\'d take some shrimp chips or crunchy noodles instead. \\n\\nAlso, this place gets busy on weekend nights and they\\'ll estimate a pretty long delivery time for you. Don\\'t despair! They told me an hour and a half once and were there in under 25 minutes. \\n\\nQuick, cheap, good and you don\\'t have to leave your house. YES.\\n\\n(Oh... and they take credit cards over the phone. But I mean, this is 2014.)\\nYea, yea.... I know some folks believe Sheetz (or Super Sheetz to \\nMatt M, hehe!) is the sign of all evil. \\n\\nBut when you live in Ohio City and your closest gas stations make you feel like you might get mugged, stabbed and left to die on a daily basis, this little gem in Mentor can seem really nice! This coming from someone who choses to live in an urban environment and runs scared of suburbia. \\n\\nI\\'m not sure what other gas stations (other than the sub shop at GetGo) let you punch in your food on an ordering screen, just the way you like it, and get it made for you within 5 minutes. Also, love their healthier food options, like to-go fruits and veggies. Check out their wall\\'o slushies and milkshakes, too. Occasionally they have a low cal strawberry banana slushy that is heavenly. They also have a large wine selection, for a gas station, that is. How can you beat that? Also, I\\'d don\\'t think I\\'ve seen so many different fresh, hot coffee varieties in any gas station before. \\n\\nAre you savoring fresh, locally-grow produce and nibbling on vegetarian-fed, ca\\nge-free meats? Probably not. But is it better than the ghetto, scary gas stations and even some of the nicer ones out there, combined? Yes. \\n\\nDouble bonus? No ATM fees on their end! WOO!\\nLike high school mathematics, this little, local pet shop has unfortunately slipped my mind for a long time. \\n\\nThankfully, I remembered that I used to love coming here! It\\'s the cutest pet shop ever--like, something right out of a movie. These are true animal lovers here with a local business  that supports other local business. I even suggested them to a film maker who was looking for a quaint, locally owned pet shop for a documentary. \\n\\nThe staff is what shines over everything here. These people really know their stuff! They even know how to set up a saltwater tank, which is not easy. But don\\'t sleep on the selection. They have reptiles, amphibians, rodents, dogs, cats, you name it! Lots of great pet foods, products and more. \\n\\nI can honestly say that I can\\'t wait to come back here with my pup.

I\\'ve lived in Cleveland my whole life, but Artefino is the perfect example of one of the lesser-none-places you will most likely accidentally stumble upon. But, you\\'ll be damn glad you did! \\n\\nI know I\\'m always preaching this, but it\\'s hard to find a work-friendly atmosphere you can hang out in all-day, get stuff done all while boasting lots of healthy food options. The Root, Nexus Cafe and now, Artefino is on this awesome, limited list. And man, do I feel stupid before judging this book by its cover! \\n\\nYou have plenty of healthful breakfast items to grab on-the-go, and it\\'s offered all day long! There is little I love more than breakfast sandwiches whenever I want them. Egg whites? Whole grain breads? You got it! Same idea goes with their homemade soups, freshly prepared sandwiches, tasty salads an\\nd melty, pressed paninis. They have more than your fair share of veggie-friendly items, too. Oh, and smoothies made sans syrup-y, fattening, calorie-packed crap! You can even design your own sandwich and make it into a half combo with soup or salad. \\n\\nThe staff is super-nice and you can see all the food being made to order. I can\\'t wait to chill and have some more working lunches here! I was even wrong about the metered parking in the front--there\\'s free parking in the back of the building!\\nA creative and innovative idea, yet seemingly simple: A bar that serves hot dogs with over 50 different toppings. \\n\\n...Damn, I wish I would\\'ve thought of that!\\n\\nDisclaimer: I\\'ve never been a huge fan of hot dogs. Now, there are a few exceptions to this. First, baseball games seem to always turn this feeling around. Second, there are times when I\\'ll be in the mood for one, but that\\'s very random. Third, I have to know what\\'s in the wiener, doggone it! Typically a kosher beef one will be fine with me.\\n \\n\\nWith all that being said, I really enjoyed myself at Happy Dog. I knew I was going to a divey bar with live music, great tater tots and pick-your-own dog toppings. What I didn\\'t expect was how delicious and fun it was going to be!\\n\\nI walked into the corner bar with a dimly lit interior and sat my tush on a bar stool. Musicians were warming up their instruments and people were chatting it up, enjoying their self-made wiener concoctions. I noticed right off the bat that this place had some history. It wasn\\'t sparkling new and was far from any \"gastro-pub\" feel, which was sort of a relief. The vibe matched the down-to-earth vibe of most Clevelanders, with a splash of hipster. I immediately felt relaxed and ordered myself a brew. \\n\\nMy zen-state was immediately interrupted when I took a look at the menu of toppings. Holy COW! It can be a little overwhelming at first, especially for Miss Indecisive over here. But once you figure out what you actually like and what you think would be good \\ntogether, it\\'s easy! (And that\\'s coming from someone who can\\'t make a damn decision to save her life at times.)\\n\\nI finally picked my ridiculously unhealthy combination (I refuse to tell what..it\\'s embarrassing), plus some tots, and divine yumminess ensued. Granted, I could only finish half of this monstrosity, but it was delish to say the least! This was partially due to filling myself up with the crunchy, perfectly fried tots of potato-y goodness. This is the kind of place that makes you want to come back just to try a different mix-up of crazy toppings. Plus I heard that Happy Dog serves a mean vegan wiener. That\\'s definitely on my \"to-try\" list. \\n\\nMy service was good, but nothing to write home about. I mean, I sat at the bar -- I wasn\\'t really expecting 5 star service from someone taking orders from a bajillion drinkers. I guess that sort of thing doesn\\'t really bother me, especially when I know what I\\'m getting myself into. If I wanted to be catered to, I would\\'ve gone somewhere el\\nse. But hey, I wanted to have a fun time with my food, enjoy some good beers, live music and a low-key vibe. That\\'s what I wanted and that\\'s what I got.\\n\\nSo yeah, here\\'s the shortened version: \\n\\nHappy Dog = Awesome Cleveland business and innovation + Fun and creativity with your food + chill, unpretentious vibe + live music. This place will be what we call a \"Cleveland Institution\" in no time, if it\\'s not considered one already.\\nI think I\\'ve been way too harsh on ya, Rite Aid. \\n\\nYes, the staff is still a little slow. Well, more like really slow. But they\\'re usually very, very nice. I\\'ve also learned that their issues with my Rx wasn\\'t really all their fault. Some of it, yes, but mostly it was just because I had crappy insurance. Now that I have great insurance, life is much better--and dealing with the pharmacy here is much easier. \\n\\nPlus, they pretty much have anything you might need in case it\\'s late and no one else is open. You know... just in case of emergencies. Bandaids, medicine', 'actual_label': 20, 'predicted_label': 20}, {'text': \", milk, wine, cheese, wine, As Seen On TV treasures, wine, make-up, GNC vitamins, wine, toiletries, wine and wine. \\n\\nLastly, while most everything is a little pricier than your average store because of the convenience factor, they have great sales sometimes and their wine is always thrifty.\\nIf falafel joints in CLE were all dinosaurs, Maha's would be the Falafelraptor that ferociously bit the heads off all its competition, defeating them all with one fell swoop. \\n\\nThey are *that* good. \\n\\nIn fact, if you say you love falafel and you haven't experienced Maha's yet, then I can't even listen to you until that's changed. Seriously. Do yourself a favor and hit up either location, the WSM or this one across from Metro Hospital. Walk up, order a falafel and hummus wrap with hot sauce, bite into it and enjoy your mind being blown. The ingredients mix together creating a slightly spicy dressing of hummus, vinegar-y hot sauce cuddled-up with fresh tomatoes, lettuce and the star of the show, the m\\nost perfect falafel in Cleveland (maybe even the world.)\\n\\nAs many of the other yelpers have explained thoroughly, these aren't your average fried balls--oh no. They're creamy, moist on the inside, crunchy and perfectly browned on the outside. And don't even get me started on the flavor. I mean, usually I can't even stomach falafel, but this is just the way it was always meant to be made. \\n\\nOther notables? For one, on a whim I ordered up some grape leaves with yogurt sauce. They were out of the lamb ones, but I was excited to try the vegetarian ones (I wanted those anyways.) Well, I have to say that these are some of my faves. I really, *really* hate mint in anything but toothpaste, mouthwash and gum. That includes grape leaves and yogurt sauce. These could have had mint in them, but I couldn't taste it--and they were divine. There was a tartness about them, although I'm not sure if it was from the sauce or the stuffed grape leaves themselves--either way they're a win in my book. \\n\\nLast\\nly, the overall service is awesome. I stopped in for carry-out and the owner herself helped me. She was such a sweetie, offering up suggestions when I told her it was my first time. I read about her and how she makes everything from scratch and talked to her about her daughter running the WSM stand. She even gave me insider tips on what times to go to her stand to avoid the crowds. Awesome. I'm an Ohio City resident and as much as I love the Market, I don't love the crowds when I'm trying to quickly satisfy my falafel cravings. This location is a fabulous alternative for busy WSM days, or even when the Market is closed.  Plus, parking is a snap and they accept credit cards.\\nA great cafe will pull you in from any side of town (within reason). \\n\\nArtefino is cute, artsy and has the glorious smells of whatever the Soup of the Day is cooking up, but doesn't really have that pull for me. \\n\\nLike many of the other yelpers mentioned, I wouldn't drive over here just to grab coffee and/or lunch, \\nbut if I was already in the area it's a great solution! The menu appears to be fresh and relatively healthy, which is definitely a plus. \\n\\nTheir service seems nice enough and efficient and there wasn't a huge crowd at any point. As far as I can tell, this place has it's regulars who come here, sit in the same seat they always do and take a nice break from the workday. Speaking of seating, there isn't a ton. They have a smaller, lounge area with plush couches and then a few tables and chairs. Keep this in mind if you're thinking about having a meeting here. \\n\\nOverall, it's a great little place with good coffee and fresh, healthy food options. It's just a bit out of the way for what it offers. \\n\\nP.S. There's only metered parking, from what I could see, and even though it's a borderline desertland out there, the cops are on those meters like white on rice.\\nJust when I thought Happy Dog couldn't get better, they surprised me with awesome service on a pretty bad day. \\n\\nThis visit was probab\\nly the best I've had. We decided to head out for hotdogs, beers and relaxation to help us out of our funk. We greeted and chatted with, which felt great after a pretty darn awful start to my bf and I's day. Drinks served immediately, maintained throughout our visit and overall, we were just taken really, really good care of. \\n\\nI went with my usual Chicago dog with Sriracha and even though they don't have poppyseed buns, the Orlando ones are delicious (and a secret shout out to CLE.) Once again, so delicious. We also put in an order of nacho cheese covered tots (don't you dare judge--like I said, it was a bad day) and our server recommended some additional dipping sauces she thought we'd enjoy--and we did! The green, chimichurri stuff and the hollandaise were both winners, and I would have never known!  \\n\\nI have to admit--I can't do Happy Dog when it's crammed with people and loud music. I think I'm getting a little old and crabby, because I hate not being able to calmly approach the ba\", 'actual_label': 20, 'predicted_label': 20}, {'text': \"r to order a drink and relax... but anyways. This visit was slow, easy, relaxing and perfect. AND we hit happy hour so this tab was super-small, which also added to our mood improvement.\\nAaaaand, I'm back!\\n\\nYes, I couldn't stay away! I just had to come back to for a workday at The Root. \\n\\nFor a Thursday morning/afternoon, it was pretty busy. Just like me, many folks were posted up working for the day and enjoying all The Root had to offer. We decided to grab a table and immediately head up to the counter to get some noms. \\n\\nI opted for an unsweetened hot chai latte with skim--which I've only ever been able to get at Phoenix Coffee. I know they use PC's beans, but I was elated to find out they could make my drink just the way I like it! My first sip was as good as my last, and let's just say it didn't last long. I was even tempted to get a second, but I'm watching my caffeine intake. \\n\\nIt wasn't long afterwards that our tummies started talking to us. We grabbed a build-your-own pizza to\\n share with provolone cheese, traditional sauce, extra mushrooms, basil and garlic. To supplement our pie, we also both ordered their side salads, which you can pick your choice of greens and dressing. Romaine and balsamic it was for us! Everything was superb and perfect for a fulfilling, healthy, light and satisfying lunch. The pizza was thin crust, crispy and fresh. You could tell the dough was made with whole grains for added benefits--melikey. The salads were obviously freshly prepared and cut right before serving. \\n\\nNot only was the food great, but the service was equally awesome. With no shortage of smiling faces and helpful suggestions, these folks know how to treat newbies and regulars feel welcome. \\n\\nThe Root is definitely going to be in my heavy rotation for second offices.\\nWhoever says Cleveland isn't beautiful, I dare you to go to Ponte Vecchio and open your friggin' eyes. \\n\\nGorgeous, breathtaking, phenomenal view of of our unique city. A perfect blend of industrial, metrop\\nolitan and natural. Bam. Right there in front of your grill. \\n\\nThis is by far one of the most romantic places to eat in C-town. Not only is the view great, but the interior is so cozy, yet modern and it's tucked away at the end of the Superior Viaduct. Talk about an adventure just finding this place! Oh, and during the summer months, the patio is king. \\n\\nNow, I know some people have mentioned that the prices can get a little bit high here. Yes, I agree. But that just means you haven't discovered their insanely awesome happy hour deals yet. So yeah, you should get on that. Seriously though, Ponte Vecchio doesn't mess around with the HH deals. We're talking about discounted top shelf martinis, wine and GOOD beers. Oh yeah, that's what I'm talkin' bout. I've left there one too many times a wee-bit too tipsy. And the high-end booze isn't the only thing on special. You can peruse the appetizer menu and get some pretty bad-ass stuff to nibble on. Not some crummy bar food either. Gourmet good\\nies. Yum.\\n\\nThe service has always been spot on for each and every one of my visits, and trust me, I've been there A LOT. (That's what happens when your significant other lives in Stonebridge for about a year.) Plus, they're all really friendly. So much so that it almost felt like Cheers when we'd walk in there. \\n\\nOh, and just in case I didn't make this clear before, the food is delicious. I've had some many different things on the menu that it's a little hard to remember, but I know the stuffed peppers are one of my favorites. We would even try to order take out, but get sucked in to the amazing vibe of the restaurant when we'd go to pick it up. \\n\\nBut yes, they do offer take-out if you can resist the urge to stay. Why would you want to though?\\nMy world just screeched to a dead stop. Did I really just find my new favorite hummus in Cleveland? Have my teeth just really torn through a soft, delicious pita with the most glorious chick pea concoction on it imaginable? \\n\\nI think, yes. \\n\\nI se\\nriously believe that I deserve a sucker-punch for having lived in Ohio City for a year now and never trying Nate's Deli until today. I've heard so many great things, yet I could not wrap my mind around trying yet another hummus that would most likely disappoint like all the rest. Well, I was wrong and I admit that now. *Shivers* \\n\\nThat's the first step, right? \\n\\nWell, now that I'm addicted to this glorious deli, I'm not sure how I'm going to deal with it being open only for lunch. Why, God?! Why?!?! I must nosh on the fresh, fan-tabulous fattosh with crunchy pita pieces! What if I can't make it in time?! \\n\\nOK, OK... I know I need to calm down. I just feel so lucky to be close to Nate's. On top of that, I've heard great things about their corned beef as well. Hello lover. You're next on my to-try list.\\nI'd like to personally thank Crop Bistro for providing me with one of the top three dinning experiences of my life--and by that I mean I gorged myself in every sense of the word on the mo\", 'actual_label': 20, 'predicted_label': 20}, {'text': 'st creatively decadent, indulgent and visually stimulating meal ever. Ever ever. \\n\\nJust a little tip from me, try to snatch up one of those coveted Chef\\'s Table spots with whoever you\\'re eating with. Maybe it\\'s because I\\'m obsessed with cooking... or it could be that I\\'m a sucker for lots of personal attention. Whatever it was, this was like a Food Network show on steroids right in front of my face. All the excitement, the talent, the smells, sights, sounds--I couldn\\'t have been happier. Seriously, a permanent smile was plastered on my face for the entire duration of our meal. \\n\\nThe service? Impeccable. Not only was the staff über attentive without being annoying, we got pampered to the fullest by the head chef (mastermind) of Crop, himself! Yep, we got to sample little shot glasses of bisque (oh.my.god.so.good.) and got great suggestions on what to order right from the source. Our servers paid close attention to every detail, as well as all the cooks preparing the artful dishes. \\n\\nSha\\nll we talk about the food? I have two words for you: Balsamic Popcorn. Anyone who knows me is well aware of my obsession with this fantastical snack prepared just normally with butter and salt. This was the best popcorn I\\'ve ever scarfed like a starved animal in my life. Honestly, I was a little embarrassed as I plowed through the large plate of this glorious dish while my boyfriend watched in horror... but not enough to care. The biscuits, bib salad with fruits and walnuts, all so-damn-delish. Simple ingredients prepared with local produce and a creative twist. Love. Finally, (as if I needed more food) this gloriously large steak was set in front of my lusting eyes and full stomach. Oh, you\\'d better believe I made room. Although I took most of it home, the combination of flavors, spices and potato-y goodness was quite an indulgence. \\n\\nSeriously, people--we are lucky to have Crop in Cleveland. There is not one part of my experience there that didn\\'t top the charts. I say \"experience\" r\\nather than meal because that\\'s what it was. The atmosphere, concept, staff, food, everything is just phenomenal. \\n\\nSo, I guess you can say that I\\'m on the Crop bandwagon now, and damn proud of it!\\nI must update my review after the wonderful dinner I had tonight!\\n\\nFirst of all, I finally experienced Crop\\'s wonderful Sunday prix fixe menu. At $25 bucks a pop for a phenomenal (and huge) three course meal, life just doesn\\'t get better. \\n\\nSecondly, we went with a ginormous Yelp group of 19 people, including 3 children and one baby, and everything went beyond smoothly. Special entrees and prices ($10) for kids, like their amazing mac \\'n cheese and handmade chicken fingers make this a dream come true. On top of that, all the dinners and side dishes came out at once!! Yes, that\\'s right. Almost 20 people and no one left sitting without food while others just looked down at their plates wondering if it\\'s getting cold. \\n\\nDid I happen to mention that everything was downright delicious? I thought I\\n loved Crop before, but now... it I think we\\'re soul mates.\\nI really have zero complaints. \\n\\nMoving can be rough in any situation, but moving while your shady ex-landlords are watching you is much worse (long story... we\\'re pressing charges.) Anyways, these guys made it a breeze while adding laughs along the way! \\n\\nThey showed up right on time with a huge truck and maneuvered that bad boy on Bridge Avenue. If you know CLE neighborhoods, that\\'s not an easy feat. They started right away with explaining everything we needed to know, had us sign paperwork and answered all questions we had. \\n\\nFirst, they told us the more we helped moved things ourselves, the quicker it would go which would essentially make it cheaper. They were totally OK with us helping shave some time off our end bill, which was a huge help. \\n\\nSecondly, these guys move FAST. The were tackling large furniture items left and right and I was surprised how quickly they moved. Honestly, I was worried about one of the guys who \\nwas a little on the smaller side (not an insult, just a bit lean), but he totally rocked through everything. And all this while carefully removing doors, not damaging walls and they fit everything perfectly and safely inside the truck. WOO! \\n\\nThird, we were just moving up the street, and they made sure they found the most efficient and quick way to get what was in the truck into our new house. They didn\\'t wait around, racking up time and ultimately costs. Major bonus. Along the way they asked us where we wanted things, so by the time they were done, we had all our furniture in the right rooms. \\n\\nLastly, these guys were so.nice. Like, really cool dudes. We bought them lunch and they took their \"lunch break\" time off our bill! And they were talkative and fun! Movers who are fun? Yes, they exist. I would recommend these guys to everyone.

I was more in the mood for something fun like wings. The only appetizer that appealed to me was garlic bread with cheese so that's what I got (I gave Gord a piece).  It was okay, not great. It seemed like it had been made an hour earlier as it was warm, not hot.\\n\\nGord ordered New England Clam Chowder and said it was good.\\n\\nOur server was Bianca and she took good care of us.\\n\\nI'd go back for drinks but not for a meal.\\nSister Sarah and I had supper at the Mandarin.

The bed was comfy,  There was a nice array of bath products.  There was a spa gift bag available for $29.50.  I've never seen a shower pouf in a hotel before.

There were snacks in a basket for sale\\n\\nThough I took a cab from the airport, there is valet parking only and it's $29/day during the week and $40/day on the weekends.

I got homefries as my side.  The burger was huge, messy and delicious!  The bun was soft, just the way I like it.  The BBQ was good and had a bit of a bite.  There was so much food that I ate the burger and left most of the homefries.  I\\'d order it again.\\n\\nI like Sunny Morning and it\\'s great knowing there is one so close to the office.\\nI had lunch today at The Bagel H\\nouse.  It\\'s a small place with a few tables jammed against the wall.\\n\\nI ordered a sesame bagel with tomatoes and bacon.  With a can of pop, it was $6.  The bagel is apparently \"authentic Montreal-style\".  Though the bagel was on the small side, it was chewy.  The sandwich was good.  I\\'d go back the next time I\\'m craving a BLT (minus the \"L\") and even a toasted bagel with butter.\\nI had lunch today at Fancy Franks.\\n\\nYou can read books about hot dogs as you eat your hot dog.  Seating is communal or you can sit by the window.\\n\\nI ordered the Fancy-zza hot dog and a Diet Coke.  I\\'ve never had a non-basic hot dog before ... the only ones I\\'ve bought have been off a hot dog vendor on the street.  At $7.50, it was definitely more expensive than \"street meat\" but it was good.  The bun was super soft.  It tasted like a pizza burger on the top and a hot dog on the bottom.\\n\\nI was still hungry so then I ordered six mini donuts dusted with cinnamon sugar ($3).

Though there wasn\\'t as much chicken or bacon as the last time I was there, today it was very good ... soooo cheesy.  They need to work on their quality control, though, to ensure this dish is consistent in the same restaurant but also across the chain. \\n\\nSteve ordered the Slow Roasted Rotisserie Beef Kaiser with cheese.

My burrito had rice, black beans, chicken, mozzarella cheese, tomatoes, corn, salsa and burrito sauce.  I love burritos and this was a yummy one.

The chicken and rice were hot and everything else was cool, which made for an interesting contrast.\\n\\nThe fellas working behind the counter were friendly.\\n\\nI\\'d stop in at this chain if I was near one again.\\nI had lunch today at Pasta Mondo.  It hasn\\'t been there very long.  I love pasta so I thought I\\'d give them a try.\\n\\nYou order in steps ... choose the siz\\ne, the pasta (the different kinds of pasta have different cooking times, which range from a minute to six minutes), the sauce, your protein (that costs extra), your cheese and if you want veggies (that also cost extra).  I got a large, fusilli pasta (one minute to cook), arrabbiata sauce and chicken.  With a bottle of pop and tax, it came to $13.  \\n\\nTo honest, I didn\\'t have high hopes for my meal and I wasn\\'t disappointed ... it was awful.  The pasta had a weird texture.  I had intended to eat it there but because the cheese wasn\\'t close to being melted, I took it back to the office figuring the cheese would melt on the way over ... um no.  I stirred it in with the pasta to help it along.  I ate about a quarter of the pasta, picked out the chicken and ate it, and threw the rest in the garbage (I hate throwing out food).\\n\\nThere were two staff.  The fella taking the orders and making the pasta looked miserable, was unfriendly and didn\\'t seem like he wanted to be there.  The cashier was a\\n bit but not much better.\\n\\nI definitely won\\'t be back.\\nWe had a beer there yesterday afternoon.\\n\\nThe back part was jammed ... it seems to be a popular spot for a late lunch. We looked at the menu and was surprised that were weren\\'t more \"pubby\" foods.\\n\\nWe sat at the bar and yakked with Steve, the bartender.\\n\\nThey had a great beer selection and a massive scotch selection ... the most expensive scotch is locked away in a safe and is $1,000 a shot!\\n\\nWe liked it there and will be back!\\nI went to the Neon Museum this afternoon.  They give hour tours for $18.\\n\\nThe nearly two-acre campus includes an outdoor exhibition space, known as the Boneyard, which features more than 150 signs, four of which are restored, a visitors\\' center housed inside the former La Concha Motel lobby and the Neon Boneyard North Gallery which houses additional rescued signs and is used for weddings, special events, photo shoots and educational programs.\\n\\nImportant historical pieces in the boneyard include the signage f\\nrom old casinos and businesses including the Moulin Rouge Hotel, the Stardust, Desert Inn and Caesars Palace as well as many others. Not just neon signage, the museum also houses fiberglass sculptures including a giant skull from the Treasure Island among others.\\n\\nIt was a fun and interesting tour and I\\'d recommend it.  There were sooooo many old signage from days gone by in every shape, design and colour.\\n\\nGuy was our guide and he was knowledgeable and funny.  He gave us a lot of the history and information about many of the signage.\\nI had supper tonight at Jimmy Buffett\\'s Margaritaville.

Then a girl climbs a ladder above the bar and goes into a volcano and comes out i\\nn a bikini.  She comes down a slide and lands in some water and does some Cirque du Soleil moves.  Then she dances for a bit.\\n\\nI ordered Buttermilk Fried Chicken, minus the green beans (so they gave me extra mashed potatoes, though I didn\\'t eat them all).  Real chicken rather than processed ... yay!

I had tomatoes, humus, garlic sauce and tahini.  After the shawarma was put together, it was put on a grill to heat it up.  The chicken was tender and had a nice spice.  It was  tasty and fun and messy.\\n\\nI\\'ll be back!\\nI had supper here tonight with two friends.  It was such a nice night and we sat on the patio (it\\'s huge).\\n\\nLiz had the Legendary Banquet B\\nurger (Classic Franburger topped with melted cheddar cheese & bacon) with sweet potato fries. She said it was good.\\n\\nDeb had the Baked Macaroni & Cheese (Not your ordinary mac & cheese! Tender pasta with 5 different cheeses [cheddar, parmesan, Swiss, Jack & blue], fresh cream & baked with a herb crust). She said it was very good.\\n\\nI had Fran\\'s Chicken Sizzler (Grilled chicken breast glazed with Fran\\'s Jack Daniels BBQ sauce, bacon & mozzarella cheese). I substituted the fries, homefries or tortilla chips & salsa for healthier white rice. Other than the chicken being cool (it was supposed to be hot), it was delicious and I would get this sandwich again.\\n\\nOur server was Julia and she took good care of us. She gave us the right amount of attention but left us alone so we could yak. It\\'s been a few months since I\\'ve Deb and Liz and it was good to catch up.\\n\\nLiz left a bit early to catch a drive home with a friend. Deb and I sat around and yakked a bit more. When we were leaving, Julia gave\\n us a hug good-bye.\\n\\nWith good food and service, I betcha we\\'ll be back!\\nI had lunch today at Shoeless Joe\\'s.\\n\\nI ordered Buffalo Chicken Tenders with medium wings sauce and dill dipping sauce along with garlic mashed potatoes.  The mashed potatoes were hot and tasty.  The tenders were just warm and overcooked, which made them hard on the outside and dry on the inside.  I don\\'t know if I would get them again.\\n\\nBonnie was my server.  She was friendly and took good care of me.\\nThis No Frills is on my way home from work ... plus there\\'s a liquor store next door.\\n\\nI stopped in yesterday for the first time on my way home from work.\\n\\nIt looks like a big store but it\\'s actually a small crappy store.  There\\'s not a lot of choice. The workers were stocking shelves when I was there.  There were stocking carts in the way and the workers were quite abrasive (obviously no customer service training).  The lack of signs made me wonder what the cost of things were.\\n\\n I won\\'t be back.   The one at Lansd\\nowne/Dundas is so much better.\\nI\\'ve been craving a chicken roti.  There was a long line-up where I usually go so I headed to Bacchus Roti Shop today for lunch.\\n\\nI ordered a chicken roti and a Diet Coke.  It was just okay.  The chunks of chicken were tender and tasty.  It seemed like the potatoes were mashed rather than chunky.  Overall I wasn\\'t crazy about this style of roti.\\n\\nDick Bacchus, the owner, was taking the orders and serving the food.  It would have been nice if he had been friendly ... he wasn\\'t welcoming at all.\\nMy husband and I spent the afternoon at Ontario Place.  We were out for a walk and wandered in because admittance is now free (you pay a set fee if you want to do stuff).\\n\\nIt\\'s definitely showing it\\'s age.  There\\'s not much to do unless you\\'re about ten.\\n\\nWe wandered around, had lunch at the Marina Grill and went for a helicopter ride.\\n\\nNo doubt we\\'ll be back to hang out on the patio of the Marina Grill.\\nI love burritos and my favourite place to go is Burrito Boyz.\\n', 'actual_label': 21, 'predicted_label': 21}, {'text': '\\nI was in Etobicoke today so stopped in at their Queensway location for lunch ...

I got chicken, rice, beans, cheese,\\ntomatoes, black beans, corn, salsa and burrito sauce.  As always, it was delicious!  I had cut it in half with the intent of eating half there and taking the other half home for supper ... but I couldn\\'t resist and ate the whole thing!\\n\\nThe staff was friendly.\\nI had lunch today at Heart Attack Grill on Fremont Street.\\n\\nIt\\'s a fun concept.  The servers and hostesses are dressed like nurses and are cheeky.  You have to wear a hospital gown (so in case you have a heart attack, you are already dressed to go!).\\n\\nThere is no diet pop and everything on the menu is not healthy.  They only take cash.\\n\\nIf you weigh more than 350 pounds (they have a scale), your meal is free.\\n\\nI ordered a rum and Coke.  The rum comes in a pill\\n bottle with your name on it (\\nTake dosages by mouth until your date looks desirable.  Side effects include dancing on the table and starting fights.)\\n\\nI ordered fries and a single burger.  They have an eight patty burger if you are up to it!  The burger was good ... I like that it didn\\'t seem like a frozen processed patty and the bun was soft.\\n\\nBy the way, if you don\\'t finish your burger, they spank you with a paddle.  Seriously!  I saw four guys get spanked and it sounded and looked like it hurt.  Needless to say, I ate all my burger!\\n\\nKortney was my server and was extremely friendly, fun and attentive. \\n\\nIt was a fun atmosphere and the food was good.  I\\'d go back.\\nGord and I had supper this evening at Louis Cifer.  It opened in October 2014 and it\\'s been on my radar for a while.\\n\\nThe bathroom signs are fun.\\n\\nIn addition to selling beer from other providers, they brew their own beer onsite.  You can buy a growler to take home.  Gord started with the ESB (and liked it) and I stuck wit\\nh the Original Sin Blonde (which I liked).  His favourite was the Retox IPA (an one-off).\\n\\nGord ordered with Mac \\'n Cheese Poppers.  I had one and it was good.  Gord enjoyed them and said he\\'d get them again.  Gord and I both got Jumbo Wings.  I got mine with Stout Sweet BBQ sauce and they were messy and delicious.  Gord\\'s were Lemon Salt \\'n Pepper Dry.  I had one and it was good.  It had just a hint of seasoning and looked and tasted grilled.  We would both get them again.  I found the wingette was a bit small but the drumettes were closer to \"jumbo\".\\n\\nI was still hungry so ordered a piece of chocolate cake.  It was just okay and I wouldn\\'t order it again.  The berries and whipped cream were good.\\n\\nThe place was jammed and there was lots of friendly staff buzzing around checking on how things were which was nice.  Alex was our server and she took excellent care of us.\\n\\nWe\\'ll be back!\\nAfter Gord and I walked around Trinity Bellwoods Park, we crossed the street and got an ice cream at L\\na Diperie, which we ate in the park.\\n\\nStep one is to choose the size of your ice cream what kind of a cone you want and step two is to choose your dip.  Steps three is to add toppings ... we passed.\\n\\nI got a medium ice cream with an orange sorbet dip and Gord got a small ice cream with dark chocolate/orange dip.  Yum!\\nI\\'ve been a member of this gym since it opened.\\n\\nIt\\'s a nice gym ... I like it.  It\\'s so close to where I live.  And the staff and owner are extremely friendly.\\n\\nA couple criticisms, though ...\\n\\nThere is no air conditioning.  During the heat and humidity of the summer, it is brutally hot in there, especially on the second floor where the machines are.  I didn\\'t go much of the summer because of that ... it encouraged me to keep my laziness at home where it\\'s air conditioned.  There are lots of fans but they don\\'t do any good.  So I\\'m looking forward to the cooler weather so I can start going on a regular basis again.\\n\\nAlso, though there are a good choice of classes, they k\\neep changing and/or disappearing.  I liked the Tuesday evening cardiokick class and then all of a sudden the teacher/trainer (who I liked) and the class vanished.\\nGord and I had a late lunch at La Cubana this afternoon.  It\\'s been there for about three years and I\\'ve walked by it about a million times but I\\'ve never stopped in.\\n\\nI started with a Cuba Libre and Gord had a Raspberry Lime Rickey (non-alcoholic).  They were both so tasty that we ended up ordering a second.\\n\\nGord love love loves black bean soup and ordered one.  He said it was the best black bean soup he\\'d ever had.  I had a taste and it was good (I\\'m not a big soup eater).  It had a bit of a bite.\\n\\nGord also ordered a Cuban Medianoche.  They make the buns in-house and they were really soft and delicious.  He said it was a good sandwich and he\\'d get it again.\\n\\nI ordered beans and rice and a Chicken Medianoche (without avocado) ... the bun was soft and the chicken was tender.

The lodge theme inside was fun.  They only serve craft beer (ie no big beer companies).  The Gosebuster by Liberty Village Brewing Co. was good!\\n\\nGord and I both got meat pies, something we never order in a restaurant.  I ordered the Traditional Beef Pie and it was delicious.  I would definitely get it again.  The fries were freshly cut.  Gord ordered the Aussie Import, which he said was delicious, along with a kale salad.  He\\'d get it again.  So colourful!\\n\\nThere was a fun vibe in the lodge.  The only thing I found a bit of a conflict was the music.  When we got there, the tunes were Motownish.  Then they switched to 80s.  Then they switched to reggae, which was really out of place for a \"lodge\".\\n\\nPhil (one of the owners) and Trish were friendly and took good care of us.\\n \\nWe\\'ll be back!\\n\\nI had a meeting in Unionville this morning and I met a friend afterwards for lunch at the Unionville Arms Pub & Grill.\\n\\nIt was quiet when I got there about 11:40am but fairly full when we left.  We sat on the dining room side.\\n\\nLeeAnn ordered Grilled Chicken Souvlaki (Tender pieces of marinated chicken breast served with a Greek salad, rice, garlic toast and tzatziki) ... she said it\\'s what she usually gets there and it\\'s good.  It was a big meal!\\n\\nI had Chicken Curry (Tender chicken breast in Vijay\\'s authentic coconut cream curry sauce served on rice) and it too was good.  There was a lot of chicken and the sauce was tasty.\\n\\nKatherine was our server and she took good care of us.\\nGord and I had supper this evening at Chimac Pub & Fried Chicken.  It\\'s a Korean chicken restaurant.\\n\\nWe shared a whole bone-in Chimac Fried Chicken with yangneom sauce and soy garlic sauce, which was served with picked radish.  The chicken was hot, tender and freshly made.\\n\\nGina was our server and she took g\\nood care of us.\\nI had lunch today at St. Louis in Ajax.\\n\\nI usually get their wings (I love their wings!) but got the bucket special for a change.\\n\\nThere were three riblets, three breaded buttermilk wings, three boneless chicken pieces and fries.\\n\\nIt was just okay ... it was nice to have a variety, though.  But I like their wings better so will get that again in the future.\\n\\nCaley was my server.  She was friendly and took good care of me.\\nI love love love pizza and I had supper tonight at North of Brooklyn Pizzeria.  Our neighbours, Nikki and Andy, had recommended it a couple months ago so I thought I\\'d check it out this evening.\\n\\nI ordered a 14 inch pepperoni pizza (it\\'s six slices) to go.  I ate half of it there and took the other half home.  It was a really good pizza.  It was a thin crust pizza and there was a bit of a bite ... maybe the pepperoni.  I thought the sesame seeds was a strange thing to put on a pizza but it worked.\\n\\nI\\'ll be back!\\nI had lunch today at the Pork & Pickle a\\nt the Montreal airport before catching my flight home to Toronto.\\n\\nI ordered a Montreal Smoked Meat Sandwich and fries.  It was just okay.  The bread was a bit dry and hard like it had been sitting out for a while.  It would have been nice to have more mustard (or a bottle of mustard on the table).\\nAfter you go through Security in the Montreal airport, there are only two restaurants to choose from. Tim Hortons is good if you don\\'t have much time and Moe\\'s Deli & Bar is good if you want a sit-down restaurant.  I caught an earlier flight home today (12:15pm instead of 1:15pm) and still had an hour for lunch so I ate at Moe\\'s.\\n\\nI sat by the window and got some work done (free WIFI).\\n\\nI\\'ve been to Moe\\'s a few times and the food is good ... I\\'ve had a burger and chicken parm. I felt like something different today so ordered the jumbo smoked meat sandwich on rye and fries and a Diet Pepsi. They aren\\'t kidding when they call it \"jumbo\"!  I hadn\\'t had breakfast this morning so was hungry. I ma\\nnaged to eat most of the sandwich, a couple of the fries, and none of the pickle or coleslaw. It was good and I was quite full afterwards.\\n\\nThe service wasn\\'t the fastest, though, so I\\'m glad I had time. There were four servers and less than 20 people in the restaurant yet all the servers seemed to disappear for periods of time.\\nGord and I had an early supper today at The Bedford Academy.  We\\'d never been there before. \\n We sat inside where it was cooler.\\n\\nGord is a fan of mac \\'n cheese and ordered the Baked Chorizo Macaroni & Cheese.  He said it was really good and he\\'d get it again.\\n\\nChelsea, our server, said the burgers were good so I ordered a New York Style Burger (minus lettuce and onions) with bacon.

In fact, I ate all the burger! The fries were good too but needless to say, my attention was on the burger.\\n\\nI'd never been to South of Temperance and enjoyed it. The service was great (the manager came over to ask how things were and helped me on with my coat when I was leaving) and the food was delicious!

Steps three is to add toppings ... I passed.\\n\\nTo make it less messy and drippy, I like that th\\ney put the cone in a plastic cup.  It was a yummy ice cream!  I  ate it across the street in Trinity Bellwoods Park.\\n\\nMaybe I'll try pina colada or peppermint dip next time!\\nGord and I love love love burritos and have been waiting for Fat Bastard Burrito to open in our 'hood for a while.  It opened on Thursday so we stopped in this afternoon for a late lunch/early supper.\\n\\nThey have a selection of burritos, quesadillos, poutine, etc.\\n\\nWe both ordered a big baked chicken burrito.  The different between then is that his had lettuce and mine had tomatoes.

My friend and I hadn't seen each other for a while and the server let us catch up (she kept stopping by to see if we were ready to order).\\n\\nI ordered the Coconut curry rice bowl (with apples, ginger + curry-buttered naan bread with chicken).  It was interesting as it had kind of a smoky taste.  The naan bread would have been better if had been plain.\\n\\nThe restaurant is in a wacky spot ... down the escalator in the basement.\\n\\nIt I was in the Yorkdale Mall and was hungry for a restaurant rather than fast food, I'd go back.\\nI love burritos and I love th\\ne ones at Burrito Boyz best!

I sat by the window and watched the planes take off and a snowplow.\\n\\nI ordered Moe's Club Sandwich with smoked meat.  It was yummy!  I'd ordered it with no lettuce or cole slaw ... but it came with them so I pulled them off and put them on the corner of my table.  My server left it there for a long long time, even after he took my plate away ... he finally took them away just before I left.\\n\\nThe food was good ... the service not so much.  It was efficient but I felt like I was being rushed out.\\nI had lunch at Swiss Chalet in Oakville on Wednesday and had their del\\nicious Cheesy Chicken Bacon Penne.

What a disappointment!\\n\\nIt was supposed to be topped with melted cheese and it wasn't.  There was a bit of cold grated cheese on top so I mixed it in with the hot pasta and it melted ... the one in Oakville was sooooo cheesy.  I guess someone either didn't know what they were doing or put it out too soon.  There was a little bit of chicken and some of it looked funky (a funny colour so I put it aside) ... the one in Oakville had chunks and chunks of tender chicken.

It's now Pork Ninjas.  Gord ordered Smoked Meat Loaf and had hush puppies and mac & cheese as his sides.  He said it was good and he'd get it again.  I ordered Buttermilk Fried Chicken with mashed potatoes and mac & cheese.  It was quite a meal and I was full at the end.  I liked everything for the most part.  I wasn't crazy, though, about the batter on the chicken.  It was too bi\\ng and puffy and overdone (I picked it all off).  I'd see if I can get the chicken without the batter next time as the chicken was tender and tasty.\\nWe had a late lunch today at Southside Louie's.\\n\\nIt was during the Taste of Little Italy.  We sat on the patio so had a great view of everyone walking around.\\n\\nI had lasagna and my husband had chicken with alfredo sauce, chicken and mushrooms.

There was so much stuff on his that it was exploding!\\nI had lunch this afternoon at Retro Burger.\\n\\nI ordered the 5oz burger combo with a side of gravy.  The fries are freshly cut.   The gravy was hot and flavourful.  The burger was good (I had mustard, ketchup, tomatoes and pickles on it).  I like that the bun was soft and lightly toasted.  There are free refills on the pop.  It\\'s a big meal and, though they were delicious, I didn\\'t finish most of my fries.\\n\\nI\\'d\\n stop in again if I was in that \\'hood and craving a burger and fries.\\nWe were there tonight for a birthday party.  There were about 25 of us.\\n\\nWe ordered supper.  I had the Italian Stallion pizza.  It was a big pizza with lots of toppings.  I wasn\\'t crazy about the crust, though.  I ate about half of it.\\n\\nGord orderd the Louisiana Style Baked Wings.  He said the wings could have been crispier and the spice was okay, not great.  The veggies were soggy but the onion rings rocked.\\n\\nOur server took excellent care of us!\\nI stopped at Five Guys Burger and Fries afterwards for a late lunch.  This chain has locations that are popping up and I haven\\'t tried one before.\\n\\nWhen you walk in, you can help yourself to some peanuts.\\n\\nI ordered a burger, small fries and a pop.  When I opened the bag, all I could see was fries.  The burger was good and I\\'d get one again. Though the fries were good, there were way too many for a small size (and I didn\\'t eat them all) and my focus was on the burger.

The jalapeño butter had a bit of a snap to it which was fun.\\n\\nWe both ordered Joe\\'s Fried Bird.  I got mine with patatas bravas and Gord got his with fries.  We both got mustard as our sauce but we found the chicken didn\\'t need it.  The chicken was good.  It was moist and the coating was flavourful.  My patatas bravas was interesting and tasty.\\n\\nWe\\'ll be back!\\nI went for a walk this afternoon and passed by Hollywood Cones (at Queen W/Gladstone).  It was sunny and warm ... an ice cream kind of day ... so I stopped in to check it out.  It just opened two weeks ago.\\n\\nYou can order cones, shakes and banana splits.

There was lots of choice.  I got a medium coconut cream pie (toasted coconut, pie crust pieces and whipped cream) with twist (vanilla/chocolate) ice cream in a cup.  It was good.  The ice cream was really creamy.  I was wondering about the pie crust pieces and it\\'s coating the ice cream along with the coconut.\\n\\nI\\'ll be back to try something chocolaty next time!\\nMy husband and I had lunch there last Saturday.\\n\\nWe\\'d stopped in the week before for drinks and liked it so wanted to get back to check out the food.\\n\\nWe shared the smoked beef brisket sandwich and the pulled pork sandwich and fries.\\n\\nThey were both moist and tasty. And the bun was really soft.\\n\\nWhen I\\'m in the mood for a pulled sandwich, I\\'ll be back.\\nI had lunch here with my colleagues today.  I hadn\\'t been to a Crabby Joe\\'s in years.\\n\\nThe service was good ... our server was very attentive.\\n\\nI ordered the baked chicken parm (lunch size) and it was delicious.\\nThis is an awesome dry \\ncleaner/tailor ... I\\'ve been going there for years.\\n\\nWayne is sooooo nice.  Regardless how busy he is, he always has a wave for us as we are walking by or beckons us in to have a chat.  Once I told him I was going away with my sister for a weekend (I only see her a couple times a year), he gave me a bottle of wine to share with her.\\nI had lunch today at the Sunset Grill.\\n\\nI felt like having breakfast for lunch so ordered 3 eggs (over easy) with ham, white toast and a glass of milk ... and it was good.\\n\\nThe servers weren\\'t overly warm and fuzzy but they were efficient.\\nGord and I had brunch this morning at the Brazen Head Pub.  It\\'s been a while since we\\'ve been there.\\n\\nBefore the Toronto Wolfpack games, people apparently meet there.  Gord and I have been to most of their home games, which are played nearby at Lamport Stadium.  The Wolfpack are now in the Super 8s (playoffs) and were playing an \"away\" game today in the UK against the Workingtown Town.  We thought it would be fun to don \\nour Wolfpack gear, go for brunch and watch the game at the Brazen Head with other fans.\\n\\nGord and I both ordered \"The Weekend\".  Gord got his with bacon and I got mine with peameal bacon.  It was a good breakfast.  The tator tots were a fun surprise.\\n\\nRather than watch an \"away\" game at home as we usually do, it was fun to watch it with other fans (plus have someone else make breakfast).  There was cheering and clapping when the Wolfpack scored and/or made great plays.\\n\\nThe Wolfpack had their first loss of the season last week so it was good to see them win today (68 - 0).\\nGord\\'s a big fan of craft beer so we went to Dieu du Ciel for a few pints of beer.\\n\\nThey brew some of their beers onsite but most are brewed at their other location in St. Jerome.\\n\\nThere is quite a list to choose from.  I had a couple of their Kolshes and a blonde (it tasted more like a wheat beer to me).  Gord love love loved the ones he had.\\n\\nThere was a good vibe in the pub ... it was packed and there were always \\npeople coming and going.\\n\\nNadège was our server and she took good care of us.  She was knowledgeable about the beers.\\nI had an appointment on east end this afternoon and stopped in to get groceries there on my way home.\\n\\nIt\\'s small, dirty and crowded.  What\\'s up with the slanted floors up by the cash registers?!\\n\\nI won\\'t be back :(\\nGord and I walked around Old Montreal this afternoon for a couple hours.  We spent some time at Notre-Dame Basilica.\\n\\nAdmittance was $5 each.\\n\\nI\\'m not religious but I find old churches interesting ... and this one is beautiful.\\n\\nA 4 hour offering candle costs $1 to light.  A 4 day offering candle costs $5 to light.\\n\\nIt\\'s very peaceful inside and worth checking out.\\nI was craving Italian food for supper this evening so walked to Guido & Angelina.\\n\\nIt was fairly quiet when I got there about 6:15ish.\\n\\nI sat at a table by the window ... a great spot for people watching.  Alas, there were lots of smokers walking by, both cigarettes and the illegal kind.\\n\\nMy red w\\nine was good.\\n\\nMegan was my server and took good care of me.\\n\\nShe brought me some bread.  It was really hard and crusty on the outside and I just had a small piece.\\n\\nI ordered lasagna.  It was made with fresh pasta and the portion was B-I-G.  Though it didn\\'t say in the description, I think there was a lot of parm cheese in it ... and I hate parm cheese.  It would have been so much better without it.\\n\\nWhen I left about 7:30ish, the restaurant was fairly crowded.\\nGord and I had supper at Earls this evening. \\n\\nWe both ordered an Albino Rhino beer ... I had a lager and Gord had a pale ale.  Yum!\\n\\nWe shared an order of Grilled Garlic Bread.  It was different but good.\\n\\nI ordered a Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich ... but without coleslaw and lettuce.  The sandwich was really good and I only had a few fries because I was full.\\n\\nGord ordered Chicken and Field Mushroom Fettuccini.  He said the only problem is that from now on he couldn\\'t see himself ordering anything else ... it was one of t', 'actual_label': 21, 'predicted_label': 21}, {'text': \"m, no one told me the Apocalypse happened here...\\n\\nOK, I lied.  Maybe it just happened in the produce section.  I really thought this Target was going to make all my dreams come true.  A place where I could buy a hot dress, pick up some unnecessary crap and shop for some fruits, veggies and meat.  All conveniently in one place.  Not so much...\\n\\nI breezed past the clothing section, which as I had heard, was a bit smaller than most to add room for the larger grocery section.  I was OK with that, knowing that there would be a fabulous and shiny grocery section to greet me.  What I found though....\\n\\nWas a post end of days scramble.  A stray apple, some onions and maybe a couple varieties of meat.  It's no Super Target, that's fo sho!  I will say, I did buy some pretty amazing Teriyaki Beef that I grilled up to perfection.  But that was probably the only win.  Oh, that and the awesome cart escalator that made me want to hop in the cart and ride it up (what, no one does that?).  \\n\\nIn all hon\\nesty, the produce section was obviously cleared out for a reason.  People want this kind of thing in the neighborhood.  Let's just keep up with the demand peeps.  I believe in you big red circle....I REALLY do!\\nFor a thrift store cohabiting downtown, I expected A LOT more.  It seemed as if there was a good amount of clothes for the space and I got pretty excited walking in.  When I started to look through the selection I surprisingly did see some designer names like Mark Jacobs and Prada but.....\\n\\nThey were all from the 80's, I swear.  I understand that's what a thrift store is...people bringing in unwanted clothes from every decade.  I just wanted something other than a bright red, huge shoulder pad stuffed pantsuit.  I know shoulder pads are back in, but I swear they're not as linebacker looking.  I also thought the prices were a little pricey for the product choice and quality.  \\n\\nI will say that the owner was extremely nice and talkative.  I just hope they get a better selection be\\ncause I agree with Andrew V., we need more shopping downtown.  Here's hoping to really super fashionable people not wanting their clothes anymore and bringing them here!\\nI may have to start every Mexican restaurant review with a warning: I'm not an expert on Mexican food but I sure did tear up the burrito I ordered!  Translation...I thought it was amazing!\\n\\nFor a burrito to please me, it needs to be big (this was huge!) and have delicious and flavorful ingredients.  I ordered the shrimp burrito and the first thing I noticed was that there was a ton of shrimp in it and they seemed to be fresh and not frozen.  I love me some sauces and I think that really topped it off for me because the queso sauce inside was incredible!  There was also loads of rice, peppers, onions, and tomatoes.  The only issue was that it was TOO stuffed and the whole thing fell apart.  I didn't really mind, considering I just ripped it apart with a fork and demolished it!\\n\\nSo now that you know I'm a fan of the burr\\nito, I have to also talk about how the chips were definitely freshly baked and probably some of the best chips I've ever had.  I realize that normally people want a kick to their salsa, but since I end up crying after a couple bites of something hot, the mild salsa was just right for me.  I also love chunky salsa, and this fit the bill.  The gauc was whipped and not chunky at all.  I was a little surprised, but I still thought it was good.  \\n\\nI just wish this place wasn't on Route 51.  How awful is 51 with the traffic??  I worry it could be the downfall of this place because it stands alone, not really around anything else. I also hope they start letting you bring in the booze...I would have enjoyed a nice Dos Equis with my meal!  But....\\n\\nAs I'm typing this my mouth is watering for another taste of that fantastic burrito.  I'll be back for you my tasty burrito friend, don't you worry!\\nYou almost feel as if they give up trying to serve good food and just concentrate on the beer.  But i\\nt's not as if it's a beer haven....just the norm....Yuengling, Miller Lite, Bud Lite, Coors, IC Light....all the Burgh staples.  \\n\\nWe (as in the boys I was with) ordered nacho's and moz sticks.  As soon as the nacho's game out I knew they would be gross.  The cheese looked like velveeta and the chicken looked scary.  The moz sticks were soggy and definitely nuked.  Yuck!  Just stay away....you've been warned!  \\n\\nThis place is simply just a place to grab a beer before or after a game.  End of story.  Ok, wait...I'm not done.  $4 for a Yuengling or Miller Lite??  No specials, no before/after game dealz?  Not cool Mullens...not cool at all.\\nFor a new restaurant I'm very impressed! I'm such a sucker for a place that has a theme that carries throughout. They obviously put a lot of thought behind how they wanted the place to look and feel. It looked like a lot of the wood was reclaimed from barns, you know, that kinda hip look right now? Are they calling it barn chic? Who knows... but I do k\", 'actual_label': 22, 'predicted_label': 22}, {'text': \"now the food was gooooood!\\n\\nI'm way into cream sodas and was so excited to see them, plus you can spike it with vodka... DONE! It was delicious too, with the seasonal flavor being pecan. The only thing wrong was that it went too fast... my bad!\\n\\nWe started off with the warm olives and mozzarella, which was good and made me want more! The crab balls were good and I think if you're really into crab, this will probably be your jam. The poutine was the only thing that was so so. The fries were legit fresh cut, but the gravy sank all the way to the bottom and wasn't very plentiful and the curds weren't very melty. This was probably the one item that was just okay. But I kept eating, so you know it was fine!\\n\\nI wanted to get just the saucy balls aka 4 meatballs. But I thought you could choose different balls and sauces (this sounds so dirty... but how can I not make this sound dirty??). But you can't do that. No ball switching allowed! SO I went with the sliders instead because you're allowe\\nd to pick your balls freely...\\n\\nI got the:\\n\\nMeatball Sliders were $3.50 each\\nClassic beef with Sunday Gravy\\nSpicy Pork with arribiatta \\nChicken with creamy parmesan\\n\\nThe best by far was the chicken with parm. I really thought I would have been down with the regular classic beef, but man was that chicken ball good! With the creamy parm it just paired amazingly. The Spicy Pork was my second fave, with a spicy arribiatta sauce to go with it. The Classic was still good, but the others just blew it out of the water!\\n\\nThe service was super friendly, and I was surprised to see it so dead, but it was a Saturday afternoon with not much going on downtown (other than a weird anime conference at the convention center). I will note that I loved their serveware! Stainless steel deep bowls with handles. It made serving and eating easier. I know that's a weird thing to notice, but I loved them and kinda want them for my kitchen now. Don't worry, I won't steal them...\\nHere's the truth (which I'll alway\\ns give you), if I hadn't gone to California Taco Shop before I went here, I probably would have given this place another star.  Since I have...it's A-OK.  Which I always have to remind myself, is not by any means bad.  \\n\\nIt's very tiny, with only two real tables, but they offer a great take out service so it makes up for the tiny dinning accommodations.  Besides, if you're like me, you inhale the burrito you purchase in 2.5 seconds and you're done, so it wouldn't matter if I had to stand and eat it.  \\n\\nI ordered the steak burrito.  I really wanted a shrimp one, but there are no seafood options on the menu.  The other menu option missing is fresh tortilla chips.  Total bummer considering they bring you a fantastic spread of regular salsa, salsa verde and jalapeno's.  I could have used something to dip in it!  So the next option was to slather my burrito in it.  \\n\\nI thought the burrito itself was good, but definitely not a giant one you'd get at Cali Taco Shop or Reyna's in the strip.  I\\nt's more of a taco size, you'll need more than one if you have a big American appetite like I do!  The steak was a little too salty for my taste, but was cooked just right.  The rice was really the winner of the burrito.  It had just the right amount of lime added.  Loved it!  \\n\\nWould I go back?  Sure, why not.  But I probably wouldn't order the steak again and I'd hope they have chips next time!  Plus, it's a fantastic addition to the neighborhood!\\nThis place is just incredible. It's a little green oasis in the midst of the upper industrial side of Lawrenceville. They have a little shop area where you can purchase terrarium creations. They come in all different shapes and sizes, plus they always seem to be of the best quality.\\n\\nI had no idea that they had an outdoor garden area, which I guess makes total sense now. But they can host bridal and baby showers and any other small-ish party on a nice day. \\n\\nNot only can you buy super cool terrariums, but you can also sign up to make them y\\nourself with the classes they offer! It really amazing me the creations they come up with, so just to be taught from the experts gives you a heads up on just buying some old succulent from Home Depot and putting it in a sad little vase. \\n\\nThey also offer wedding and special event decor and set-up. I would have NEVER thought of using succulents as accents, but holy crap, would an inventive and cool idea! Plus, the owners are just the nicest people ever, so it's easy breezy to work with them!\\nMegabus: The classier Greyhound\\n\\nThis is an actual convo between me and my mom whilst riding the bus:\\n\\nMe: I'm on the Megabus to Philly.\\nMom: You're on a shuttle to the airport?\\nMe: No, I'm riding the Megabus to Philly.\\nMom: Who are you flying with?\\nMe: No, I'm on a bus traveling to Philly that's like a higher class Greyhound!\\n\\nShe finally got it.   \\n\\nFlights to Philly were over $200 dollars.

Oh, plus I\\'m on the ground and not dying.  \\n\\nSo no crazy airport drama.  You just wait on on the corner (yes, kinda like a hooker) by the Convention Center and they pick you up and you leave right at your designated time.  NO DELAYS!  If you\\'re late....too bad...you miss the bus, literally!\\n\\nThe buses are nice enough, the seats recline, there\\'s enough room to spread out (especially if no one is sitting by you) and there\\'s plugs for you to charge your computer, phone, etc.  That\\'s obviously a definite plus.  \\n\\nThe only stops are one to a rest area for 30 minutes.  Which is nice because there\\'s a Starbucks.  I may have also had BK on the way back, but don\\'t tell anyone...I really wanted a whopper.  The other stop was in Harrisburg for a hot second.  \\n\\nThe couple of drawbacks.  There\\'s no tray to put your laptop on.  So it sat on my lap and I crouched over it in a pretty uncomfortable position for most of the trip\\n.  Also, if there\\'s traffic in whatever city you\\'re traveling through, you\\'re pretty much screwed.  The ride out arrived right on time.  The ride back was an hour and half late.  But again, the same could happen if you\\'re flying and your plane is delayed.  \\n\\nI had a really funny driver on our way back to the Burgh.  He basically gave us a lecture.  No drinking, smoking or talking loudly on your cell phones or you\\'re getting kicked off the bus.  And don\\'t you dare take longer than 30 min at the rest stop or he\\'s leaving your butt behind!\\n\\nMegabus, you are a steal and I\\'m totally into you!\\nIt\\'s happening. They\\'re taking over the world. One mall at a time and... it\\'s awful.\\n\\nAs you would expect, everything is overpriced. Like, way overpriced. My friend really wanted to go (and by friend, I really mean friend, but I admit I kinda wanted to go as well... this is the truth). So we hiked down the not so walking friendly strip all the way from Planet Hollywood down here. \\n\\nMy friend was going \\nfor those face picture mask things. Pretty much a photo on a stick you can hold up to your face so you can be a Kardashian too. For the \"low\" price of $7, you can own a piece of Kardashian Khaos for yourself. Methinks not.\\n\\nThe saving grace? The frozen yogurt store across the way. I\\'d invest in a delicious $7 treat before I\\'d invest in a $25 dollar Kardashian mug.\\nLet me set the scene for you.... \\n\\nHere it is pouring out. You walk in drenched. You sit at one of those old school checkered booths. Depressing indie music is playing in the background. Regulars are greeted by the bartender and served up their usual drink. I felt like I was in an indie movie! \\n\\nSo in real time, the place has CHEAP happy hour deals! $2 Yuenglings and $4 mixed concoctions. Yesterday was the Presbyterian. It was a mix of Bourbon, Ginger Ale and Soda Water. Not my cup of tea....but maybe someones...perhaps?? \\n\\nThe grand jewel of the place is the mac n\\' cheese. I kept hearing these tales of the most delicious mac\\n n\\' cheese you will ever feast on. Of course I had to get it! When it came out it looked like the real deal homemade version! Slightly burnt top layer of cheesy goodness. Inside a gooey noodly mixture of cheese, with a strong pepper flavoring. I believe when there was no more noodles to be found, there may have been some bowl licking. For real, that good! \\n\\nIt was sad but kinda funny because a family of four came in with some small children. They wanted to come because they had heard the \\nmac n\\' cheese was so good. Well, it\\'s considered a straight bar so they weren\\'t allowed in with children under 18. The mom was like, I called earlier, it\\'s the kids birthday! Too bad....they may have had to settle for some easy mac!\\nIt\\'s hipster grocery shopping at it\\'s best! Not too fancy like Whole Foods but \"green\" enough for those crazy kids! I like this place a lot because it offers up very fresh fruit and veggies. Seriously, you wouldn\\'t believe the difference between organic asparagus and the r\\negular old green kind. Plus they have a really great selection of organic meats and seafood. \\n\\nThe thing I really love about this place is the large selection of food to go. It\\'s great that it\\'s right around the corner from work. It\\'s in the Strip District and, gasp, there\\'s FREE parking in their garage if you buy something from the store. No more parking illegal for this girl (well, in this instance at least.) I luuurve that they sell Penn Ave Fish Company sushi to go so that I can just grab that for lunch instead of fighting the lunch crowd at the actual restaurant. \\n\\nThey also always have a plethora of soup options Sometimes 8 at a time! And although half of them sound a little scary to me, I can usually always find that delicious tomato bisque I totally crave. I also try to convince myself that it\\'s healthy even though it\\'s probably made with a gallon of heavy cream. But that\\'s beside the point. \\n\\nAnnnnnd, their baked goods!

I watch for no one looking at me in the deli and scarf at least five samples down if I can! But everything is baked fresh to order, cookies, cakes, scones, pies. It's a great place to order a cookie tray, which I KNOW yinz Pittsburghers love! \\n\\nThe added perk to this place is thee most friendliest, cheeriest, funniest guy that runs the check out line at the to go good counter that just brightens my days with his prerequisite fist pump. I'll totally fist pump for this place!\\nSeriously, one of thee most unique places to eat in the Burgh!  Big thing here is, it's an antique shop that also has awesome vegetarian food!  So being a antique shop, they draw upon that for all their decorations in the dining room area.  It's like walking into your quirky grandma or aunt's house. \\n\\nThe food could stand alone, without the antiques shop.  I ordered the lentil burger for the first time ever.  I can happily report back t\\nhat it was absolutely delish!  It was HUGE and packed full of goodies (what I found out was, lentils, bread crumbs, potatoes, etc.).  The burger kinda fell apart after a few bites so I opted to eat with a fork.  No worries, it still tasted good!  It also came with a side of chips, but I opted out because of my lame diet and ended up getting a side salad.  The side salad acted more like a full salad, it was served in a tiny bowl stuffed full of fresh lettuce, peppers and grapes!  \\n\\nSince I'm a huge fan of tea I was also super excited to see such a massive tea list.  I choose the Almond Spice black tea and am happy to report it was super tasty.  Loved that it came out in a pot all for myself!  I love my own personal tea parties!\\n\\nThe antique side is, of course, filled with a plethora of chachkies.  But there's many many treasures to be found!  I totally dug a couple of awesome 70's style dresses that inspire me to find some kind of 70's themed party (or throw one!).  I thought the vintag\\ne costume jewelry selection was awesome though!  It was a win win for me walking out of there with a full belly and a $12 vintage bracelet!  \\n\\nDon't be fooled, this place is legit awesomeness!\\nVery impressed! I feel like I'm a pretty tough judge on deli/sandwich shops.  I think it's really easy to make a boring sandwich, salad or side.  They can just end up being bland and not creative at all.  That is NOT the case with this place (look at my rhyming!).  \\n\\nFirst thing's first.  Everything on the menu looked awesome!  From the sammies to the salads to the sides, it was really hard to decide.  I'm a sucker for roast beef and horsy dressing, so I went with the Roast Beef sandwich.  It definitely held it's own with a nice amount of meat, lettuce, tomato and horsy dressing (I love me some sauce!) on a delish ciabatta bread.  \\n\\nI also sampled the bean salad and pasta salad.  I LOVED the bean salad!  It was super tasty and had great flavor.  The pasta salad was bland.  I wouldn't get that aga\\nin.  Only loser in the meal though... so I still left a very happy lady.\\n\\nThe bakery part of the deli looked incredible!  I could have gobbled it all up.  I, of course, had to get something!  So I tried the homemade s'more.  It was ooey gooey goodness!  I had my eye on a couple other items I'll certainly be back for, promise!\\n\\nAlthough the line was long, it moved along fast and was able to zip in and out in no time.  This is such a great spot for a quick lunch, if I worked downtown I might be tempted to go in every day!  Another new establishment we're lucky to have in the Burgh!\\nAs an adult, this place is awesome. As a child, I'm sure this place is even more awesome! I honestly don't know how you couldn't have fun here, unless you had a broken foot, that would suck (been there!). Actually, in reference to the foot, I did feel a little timid starting out, but once you get to jumpin', all your inhibitions fall away! \\n\\nThey have a handful of different areas for you to jump, including a r\\negular jumping area, where you have your own little square to jump to your hearts content. There's also a spot for you to jump and dunk, play dodgeball and then of course the crown jewel, jumping into the foam pit! \\n\\nFor $16 you can jump for an hour, plus you get special orange socks that have little sticky pads on them so you don't slip. But you blink, and the hour is over! Although I was totally exhausted by the time I was one. Once you get in the jumping area, they don't really allow you to sit down on the mats, you gotta keep moving or get out! \\n\\nOne thing I will note is that if it's dark, it's very hard to find. It's in an industrial park and all the buildings look the same. On top of that, the signage is pretty small and not noticeable. I feel like if they're allowed, they should have bigger signage that's well lit. That's my only gripe! Other than that, it's a fun filled evening!\\nOoh la la!

Because it looked expensive.  Unfortunately, I was right.\\n\\nSo here\\'s the thing.  I do indeed shop at boutiques.  I do indeed realize they\\'re going to be more expensive than Forever 21.  But, the difference is you may just find something you\\'re not going to find at Forever 21 and more importantly... better quality!\\n\\nI had received a pretty awesome headband/fascinator from here for Christmas so I was excited to check out the rest of the stock.  I did love every single headband they had in stock.  I picked a fun almost birdcage style headband that I know won\\'t fall apart in 6 months.  \\n\\nI also saw a lot of really fun mod looking dresses.  I actually loved a lot of the clothing in there.  It was just a tad over what I usually pay.  Although I may end up thinking about that green 60\\'s looking dress for a week and buying it.  You never know!\\n\\nI\\'d definitely stop in for the pretty headbands and scarves when I\\'m downtown though... and maybe that dress!\\nW\\nhat a cute little place!  It\\'s uber tiny, but you get the feeling it will pack a big punch.  I opted to try out the lunch first because I was very intrigued by the grilled cheese and tomato soup I had read about in other reviews.  \\n\\nSure enough, both were mighty fab!  There wasn\\'t a thing I would change about the grilled cheese.  The bread (wheat or grain) was awesome and it was toasted perfectly.  Tomatoes inside were an added bonus.  But the real winner of was the cheese.  Oh Cheddar, oh cheddar, how I love thee!  It was sharp as could be and absolute melty goodness.  I was in cheesy heaven!\\n\\nThe soup was definitely good, but not great.  I think it could have done with a little more pepper and a tad more cream to add to the bisque name.  It tasted just a tad too runny for bisque.  If I\\'m going to calorie overload on my bisque, you better commit with my heavy cream!  \\n\\nService left a little bit to be desired.  She just seemed very unenthusiastic about everything.  I really enjoy askin\\ng the server about different menu items, to get their take on what they enjoy.  Maybe I\\'m too trusting, but I assume they\\'ve tried mostly everything and have opinions about them.  I mean, I wouldn\\'t work in a place I hated their food (that\\'s maybe why I stuffed myself with one too many EnP Superburgers back in my day).  She didn\\'t really offer much....oh well, you can\\'t always have a peppy server (Lord knows I wasn\\'t all the time!).  \\n\\nI can\\'t wait to go back and try the dinner.  Everything on the lunch menu sounded awesome, and I\\'m sure dinner would be just the same.  I\\'ll be back with my bottle of red for BYOB BABY!\\nJury is still undecided. Jury being me.\\n\\nI reeeeeally wanted to like it. I love noodles, so with noodles in the name, I expected greatness! I was surprised to only see 12 noodle options with many many other food dishes listed on the menu. There were way more options for soup noodles, but not feeling like soup, I went with the \"dry\" Dan Dan Noodles with shrimp. \\n\\nI will pr\\neface this by saying, maybe it\\'s just a certain preparation that I\\'m not used to, but the peanut sauce tasted vinegary to me. Am I crazy? Maybe. But I swear it had a specific taste I could not get past. I honestly couldn\\'t decide if I liked it or I didn\\'t. I came to that realization three days later after I had eaten the leftovers for that amount of time (yes, they give you THAT MUCH FOOD!). \\n\\nAs I said, maybe it\\'s just in the preparation. But I\\'d like to come back and get some dim sum, or some bubble tea (very limited flavors) or maybe another noodle dish. A girl\\'s gotta do her research, right?!\\nEven though this place had three stars (and three $ signs, which made my cheap side a little worried) I still had heard a lot of good word of mouth, so I wanted to try it out.  \\n\\nI went about this dining process by rating it as the action started.  Our server walks up to us and asks if we had ever been there.  His response was great, telling us all about the farm to table experience they try t\\no create there.  He was extremely helpful in picking out our drinks, Lyeth Meritage for me...at $14 a glass...YIKES.  But it was really light and refreshing for a red wine.  My friend got a gin and tonic, the gin being infused with cucumber deliciousness (I assure you, I tried it a couple times).  We\\'re 5 stars at this point folks.\\n\\nWe both decided on the tasting menu since everything looked good.  $35 for three courses is pricey for me, but I was splurgin\\' here (dah, $14 wine).  To start I choose the Wild Mushroom Flatbread.  Now bear in mind, I thought the tasting menu portions would be, well, tasting size.  It was regular appetizer size, you know, for like two people.  I ate almost all of it....other than the piece I shared with my friend.  It was THAT good.  Porto mushrooms, pesto and feta cheese.  YUM!  Still 5 stars people.\\n\\nI was torn between a the healthy Sonoma Salad and the Pecan Crusted Haluomi.  Since my friend is generous, she said she\\'d get the cheese and give me a piece.', 'actual_label': 22, 'predicted_label': 22}, {'text': \"  Win win!  The salad was good but the Haluomi...holy crap!  It was amazing!  I cannot believe it's served as a whole meal.  It comes with potatoes and broccoli, but I would need something else.  Even though cheese does fill lots of voids in my life.  \\n\\nAt this point we've downgraded the score to 3 stars because our second course came out AN HOUR after our first course was served.  The server came by only once to say our courses would be close together (because we were going to a show and in a rush at this point).  He never came by to ask if I wanted another glass of wine (a no, but still).  Or just to tell us the kitchen was running slow tonight, etc.  I would have taken any excuse.  But there was nothing.     \\n\\nFinal course was the Crispy Indonesian Glazed Duck.  Don't get me wrong, it was VERY good and crispy, but I thought the glaze overpowered it enough where I felt like I was eating at a Chinese restaurant....where my meal would have been $8.  \\n\\nRegardless of the wait times I sti\\nll thought the meal was solid, if not a tad overpriced.  Would I go back?  Yes.  Would I soon or frequently?  Probably not.  The mystery of the 3 star rating has been solved.  \\n\\nSonoma Grill, get on your game, you could be a 5 star!\\nYo Pretzel, Yo Pretzel Yooooo!\\n\\nFor realz, Go Pretzel may be my new ish!  Pretzels are one of those things that are hard to mess up, but sometimes it happens.  Too greasy, too doughy, stale.  There's a a secret technique to having a tasty little twisted dough treat.  This place has it down!\\n\\nI couldn't resist the Cinnamon Pretzel (although the toasted almond one will be my next conquest) with sweet glaze.  The pretzel was fantastic.  Cooked perfectly, not too doughy, but had that fresh baked taste.  It had enough sugar to coat all my fingers, which means it was just enough!  The sweet glaze is pretty much cinnamon roll icing.  It tasted a little like icing and was incredibly thick.  I may have dipped my finger in it after I was done with my pretzel. \\n\\nSpeak\\ning of the end....of my pretzel.  I was sad when I finished it.  I wanted more, which is the point of having quality products.  They also had a variety of other flavors of pretzels and dipping sauces.  If you're looking for the total lunch package you can get a Pretzel Dog (a pretzel wrapped hot dog) and a dessert pretzel.  Done and done! \\n\\nI'm hooked!\\nVery happy on a return visit back for a different service! My sad story started with a pretty horrible Brazilian wax job there. It wasn't bad in terms of it not turning out looking/feeling okay after, but the whole process was literally very painful. I was used to getting waxed within a 20 minute span from other places. This wax took well over an hour. While I am at fault for not letting the biz know how bad it was, I never went back for another wax after torturing myself twice with the same waxer.\\n\\nI had an inkling this was just a specific person and not the biz fault. Plus, I was happy to hear said waxer had left. I scheduled a facial \\nwith Dawn and she couldn't have been sweeter. I loved how much info she gave me on my skin and what she was doing. Plus, it was just enough chat time vs relax time. \\n\\nYou can get a special first time new customer deal for $59, which they were nice enough to give me, even though I'd been there before. Facials are really just the best, and I really do feel like my skin looks and feels better. I really like that you can buy memberships too, where you can pay a monthly rate and receive special prices and discounts on services. \\n\\nI will absolutely be back, can't wait to try the message next!\\nI had been waiting to come here for a while now after being pregnant for what seems like forever, I wasn't going to come here and not eat all the meats! And all the meats I did eat... including seafood as well!\\n\\nHonestly thinking about the seafood, I almost enjoyed the seafood the most. We had a fantastic Bacalao cod dish that was reminiscent of the Italian baccala dish I love, but a Spanish version. I \\nalso loved the octopus, which was grilled to perfection. An unexpected and maybe favorite dish was the fresh tuna crudo with delicious peaches. It was such a great summer dish. \\n\\nWe ordered a huge charcuterie board with literally all the meats on the menu. I'd imagine we had about 10 meats on the tray. They were all fab, but my favorite was probably the Sherry Pork Salami. Full disclosure, we had a group of 6 people... So we may have over ordered too much food! By the time our last dishes came, we were all pretty full! Our last dish was the wings, which I did enjoy, but again, it was the last dish and we were stuffed!\\n\\nA couple of the sides I loved too were the pickled carrots and the heirloom tomato gazpacho... Which is a huge bowl and maybe not the smartest thing to order with a ton of other foods, because it was so much food! \\n\\nThe environment was great though with dim lighting and a Spanish vibe. I'd probably come to the bar and order some snacks and a wonderful glass of rose again\", 'actual_label': 22, 'predicted_label': 22}, {'text': \"!\\nThis place was fantastic! Honestly, most everything was delicious. The Preacher's Ham Biscuits were just drool worthy. Probably the best thing we ordered. I'd say that and the ribs... Which we didn't order, but a friend did and we stole... because they were so good! We also ordered the chicken, waffles and watermelon, which was crispy and moist, plus the waffles were awesome.\\n\\nThe absolute only reason it didn't receive the 5th star from me is that the mac n' cheese and gnocchi pot pie and fell a little flat. The gnocchi seemed out of place, almost like a middle eastern inspired dish. Not southern at all. It was good, but just didn't mesh with the other items on the menu. \\n\\nI also ordered an old fashion, which was on point. The only thing we thought was weird was that they really pushed the desserts on us, HARD... Right when we got sat. Their schtick was that the one dessert needed to bake for 30 minutes, or something like that. I get it... Up-sell. But, it came off annoying. \\n\\nYou de\\nfinitely want to make a reservation. I made mine a couple weeks in advance and it was still one of the only spots left. Not too hard to find in the Venetian either. I'd even come here for drinks and snacks... And probably just the ribs alone!\\nI might be over Nordstrom Rack. I feel like I find more items I like here. Especially in the shoe department! I've been able to snag some super discounted Kate Spade flats. I always seem to find the right pair of shoes for the different seasons when I'm strolling the racks. \\n\\nI wish their handbag section was slightly bigger, seems the selection is limited, but not by too much. I also wish they had a bigger kids section. The clothes are always cute, but it's so small! \\n\\nI love the jewelry section. It's actually pretty big. So if you're a baubles lover, you'll love this! The clothes section is decent too, although I feel like that's the last thing I look at. I really don't find too many items I love or want to drop the money on. Shoes is really wher\\ne it's at here!\\nWhen I heard piano bar, my first thought for some reason was dueling pianos. But it's one sole piano, with a player and rotating singers. And you know what? The singers aren't bad! They're actually good! \\n\\nThey'd have to be since Robert De Niro was in there! (Disclaimer: he was not really in here, but a dude that looked very much like him was). I was surprised that for a Friday night it wasn't too busy (and looking at other reviews!). But we were able to grab a table for 6 and slide right in. \\n\\nIt's a nice place to take a mixed group of people considering the songs ranged from classic to today. The service was super friendly too. It seemed the server was one of the only people on the floor and she still did an awesome job. Kudos to the bar staff when they rock it out when they're busy! Keepin' it classy all the way!\\nThis is not just child's play!  I really thought it would be all about lame science junk.  So, I was TOTALLY wrong!\\n\\nI know I'll sound like everyone else, b\\nut it really is for all ages.  Science for me needs to be at a simplified level.  I may have enjoyed high school English, but Science....not my strong suit!  The way they demonstrate simple ways electronics move and work  The intricate weather displays you can actually touch and learn about how all that weather stuff happens.  I mean, tot to get too technical, of course!  \\n\\nThe one thing that really brings me back to my childhood is the mini railroad exhibit.  My family used to travel down to the burgh around Christmas to see the exhibit all decorated for Christmas.  It's a special memory I have that I can still experience now.  Plus, mini things are cute, right?!\\n\\nI never realized how cool omnimax movie theaters are until I experienced the one here.  It really is a WAY different experience than watching a flat movie screen.  It basically engulfs you with sights and sounds.  I saw a show on ancient Greek islands and it was breathtaking.  The popcorn is always an added movie bonus!\\n\\nThe\\n bonus about owning a Carnegie Museum membership is that it gives you access here as well.  Plus you get a discount on omnimax and museum special events.  If you sign up for the email list you get notices on everything going on, so don't send this email to junk!\\n\\nI'm not gonna lie, the children's play area looks pretty cool.  I think I'm too big for that stuff now, but I can still learn about super awesome science in the rest of the place!  \\n\\nWait, what did I just say?!\\nWhile El Lugar is located in Federal Galley, it truly does deserve it's only dedicated page for the sole reason that I can say again how obsessed I am with their food. I have not had one single item that didn't blow me away!\\n\\nI'm currently craving the Hot Mess daily. It's one of their brunch items. I believe it may be on the main menu all the time, but don't quote me on that. All I know is that when it's on the menu, get it. It's basically a magical mix of nacho's, mole, cotija, potatoes and an egg. So freakin' good! I'\", 'actual_label': 22, 'predicted_label': 20}, {'text': 've also had their pork enchilada\\'s, which are equally as phenomenal and a super hearty helping. \\n\\nThey have tasty horchata too, which they sometimes switch the flavoring up. I need to stray from that Hot Mess when I go... But it just draws me in. As should this place for you!\\nMy hunt for the perfect wedding dress took me all over the city and beyond. I was definitely not the \"first dress you put on is the one\" kind of girl. I needed to shop around (A LOT} to find \"the one.\" \\n\\nI feel justified saying that if you\\'re about to drop a good amount of money on a beautiful dress you\\'re only going to wear once on a pretty important day, you should have suburb service. I\\'d say service here was adequate. I wouldn\\'t say they were incredibly friendly but they were efficient and my dress came in on time and the fittings all went without any hiccups. \\n\\nIn the huge bridal stores like MB Bride in Greensburg, you feel like a number. They hassle you in and out like cattle. I know it\\'s a huge store, so th\\nere\\'s a lot of traffic, but I wanted a more personal experience for something this special. That\\'s why I feel like a boutique experience is the way to go when choosing a bridal gown. \\n\\nI also liked the huge selection of dresses. They carry designers such as Maggie Sottero, Lazaro and Jim Hjelm. You can choose from the whole spectrum of classy to couture bride. I\\'ve actually been in here a couple times after my wedding and it always seems like they\\'re up on the latest in bridal fashions. \\n\\n*Important note: You absolutely MUST make an appointment to see any dresses. Especially at peak bridal time...which is almost all year except winter at this point.\\nI\\'m horrified by my experience today. It. Smelled. Awful!\\n\\nAnd here\\'s the thing. Gyms probably naturally smell awful. But it\\'s the staff/gyms job to not let that smell linger. Of course there\\'s going to be sweat, B.O. and God knows what else lingering long past your work out. But I\\'d think it should be one of the main objectives to keep it \\nsmelling fresh, because you\\'d want to keep people coming in.\\n\\nBut here\\'s the thing. I\\'m paying for not only the use of the machinery, but also the actual space. Do I want to work out in a place that smells like stale B.O.? No way! I want to work out in a clean, properly air conditioned and comfortable space. None of these things are happening here right now. \\n\\nThat brings me to my next point. Every summer the place suffers from stale and poorly ventilated air. What does that mean? It\\'s freakin\\' hot in herre! I\\'d understand you wouldn\\'t want to work out in an ice box. But this isn\\'t a sauna either. It\\'s awful and you can tell it\\'s not supposed to that way. \\n\\nI\\'ll leave you with this final fact. I hopped on the elliptical today and there was gum on the front part where you\\'d put your cell phone. Seriously?? That\\'s rude for the person that did that, but rude that no one would clean that up. I\\'m honestly disgusted at this point. \\n\\nI hope they clean up their act (literally) or I may take my\\n sweat somewhere else that does a better job masking it.\\nI\\'m going to make a bold statement and say this is probably one of my favorite restaurants in Pittsburgh. Why? Because it\\'s ALWAYS consistently excellent.\\n\\nMy only experience had been for lunch, but I finally made it to dinner and I have to say, what took me so long?? It was incredible. \\n\\nI ordered \"what they\\'re know for\" (as the waitress said), the Chilean Seabass. Another bold statement, it may be one of the best dishes I\\'ve ever had! It was so light and fluffy, but packed with flavor. Mainly because the horseradish glaze was out of control good. Add on a delicious mix of slaw and rice and it was the perfect dish.\\n\\nPlease, city folks, do not poo poo coming out to the South Hills! It\\'s so worth the annoying ride up West Liberty, promise!!\\nThis is such a beautiful space! I\\'d passed by here on so many occasions but had never peeked inside. Half of the reason might be because I\\'m not an insane baseball fan, but still, I learned you\\n don\\'t necessarily need to be to come in!\\n\\nIt\\'s an old firehouse and they\\'re restored it spectacularly. I could imagine having a small wedding or party here easily. That\\'s why I popped in finally. It\\'s interesting to check out all the memorabilia and artifacts they\\'ve collected from Roberto Clemente\\'s career and even just baseball artifacts in general. \\n\\nIf you\\'re a baseball fan, you 100% have to stop in and check it out! If you\\'re not, but maybe looking for a unique space to host an event, this should be on your list to check out!\\nI\\'m obsessed and I\\'ve never even set foot in the store! I\\'ve only ordered delivery, but all I know is that they offer up some delicious food. You know it\\'s good when you crave it.\\n\\nMy go to right now is the Pangea Bowl which is rice, avocado, black beans, corn, tomatoes and this fiery BBQ sauce I could probably pour over everything for the rest of my life and be fine with.\\n\\nThis last time I also tried a Recoverii smoothie and it was just as good as it sounde', 'actual_label': 22, 'predicted_label': 22}, {'text': \"d with coconut milk and mango. I'm sure I'll be ordering again soon, I just need to switch it up and try something different!\\nStack'd has got some stacked burger competition. With BRGR right around the corner, two Winghart's locations and two Burgatory locations... along with Tessaro's and a handful of other joints, you gotta really make those patties shine to get noticed in town. \\n\\nDid they shine? Not so much. It wasn't a bad burger. It just wasn't great either. To be honest, I really think that it may have been a frozen patty. It had that perfectly rounded shape that you see when you buy them pre-pattied (is that a word?) in the store. You're able to pick from a checklist of ingredients. I mean, TONS! And not just ketchup and mustard, but mac n' cheese and tator tots on top of the burger. I literally don't know how you'd eat the thing! \\n\\nWhat I've learned in my burger eating days is that I like to keep it simple. For me it's #1 the burger quality, #2 the cheese and #3 the sauce. I wa\\ns really excited to try the Big Mac sauce they call McDowell sauce (why that name, no idea). Listen, I can't lie. Sometimes scarfing down a McD's burger is delicious. It may be when I'm super hungry and craving that type of food, but I'll instantly regret it after. I did not instantly regret it after, but the whole burger just fell flat. While the sauce was good, I really think it was the issue with the burger. Just not quality meat, no taste and possibly from a frozen patty. \\n\\nI ordered the tots on the side because they sounded so good on the toppings menu. They were tots. Again, I could get these tots out of the frozen section of Giant Eagle. Not that I'm expecting gourmet tots... this was just something I that I knew how it would taste before I got it. I was just lusting after some fried potatoes. \\n\\nThe beer list actually looked decent and so did the boozy shakes. But after the burger, I'd be afraid to try them. Knowing that around the corner in East Liberty I'd be getting a delecta\\nble shake from BRGR. I wouldn't go out of my way to come here again. Actually, I'd probably not even suggest it. Just go to Winghart's, you'll be happy you did, I promise!\\nLooking back on the review I wrote from last year, it seems the menu has switched up quite a bit, which is always good in my book! \\n\\nI like that they were easily able to accommodate me being gluten free. The waitress was really nice about explaining the dishes I could get, which were mostly everything, save for a few items. Those few items were easily modified too. Happy to hear that! \\n\\nThe highlights were the beet conserva, fried artichokes, manzanilla olives, mackerel escabeche and serrano ham were all delicious. I could eat a whole pile of the marcona almonds myself. These are always a must when I come here. \\n\\nI did feel like we went back and forth between hits and misses. The octopus, which was so good last time, was overcooked and tough.  I'm a firm believer of telling the truth when a server asked, so we did le\\nt her know how tough the octopus was. The lamb dish was good, but the sausage was actually better than the lamb because of how much sauce was in the dish. The accompanying paella didn't have much flavor. \\n\\nThe chorizo, a favorite of mine, had so much vanilla and date sauce I could barely taste the chorizo. When I did get hints, I liked it, but could have done without so much sauce. And don't get me wrong, I love me some sauce, so it was weird how heavy they were with all the sauces.\\n\\nThe sangria we ordered was watered down and didn't seem like the wine ratio was right. I was bummed. But a bottle of red wine did the trick. I'm no wine expert, but it seems you can't go wrong with their excellent selection of wines. \\n\\nNone of the dishes were terrible, other than the overcooked octopus. I know they can do better and have an excellent head chef/owner. I don't know if maybe this was an off night? I would definitely head back in and try it out again.\\nI am an addict to their tea. I start to pa\\nnic when I realize I'm running low on my two favorites, the Vanilla Black and Earl Grey. Since the shop is on the opposite end of town from where I live, I stock up with a good amount. Seriously, when I asked for 10oz of each, the person working didn't believe me at first! \\n\\nSo why do I like the tea so much? It's super flavorful and is strong enough that those flavors come through balanced, but aren't overwhelming. It's probably the best early grey I've ever had, seriously!\\n\\nEveryone who works here is so nice too! They're happy to talk tea with you, which I love. They have over 100 different blends on hand, so there's something for everyone in terms of black, herbal, green and more. They even have a matcha blend, for those who are on that kick (not a fan, but I know a lot of people are). They also have a small amount of retail you can buy. Great gift options for tea lovers! \\n\\nMy tip would be if you have your heart set on a certain tea, call ahead. Sometimes they run out... Especially i\", 'actual_label': 22, 'predicted_label': 22}, {'text': \"f you have a fave and order a good amount. They also can brew up tea if you want something on the go!\\n\\nIf you're a tea lover, you have to go here stat!\\nThis place has been a favorite of mine since it opened.  No need to go to Benihana's ever again!  It's locally owned right in the heart of the hip South Side area.  You'll definitely need a reservation for most nights of the week as it is ALWAYS busy.  You may pay for the ambiance but it's definitely worth it for the food.  For drinks try the Key Lime Pie Martini, for an app try the Hawaiian roll and for the habachi try the filet mignon or tuna steak.  They melt in your mouth!  Added bonus, if it's your birthday you bang on a large gong!\\nI feel like this is my go-to restaurant when I'm around that side of town. It's great for happy hour, family get togethers and casual date nights. I love that you can put yourself on the wait list too, because it can get super busy on the weekends.\\n\\nI was so happy to hear that they were gluten free frie\\nndly, considering this was a fave spot pre-celiac diagnosis. The only meatball you can get gluten free is chicken. I'm wondering why that is though? Let me be clear, I'm appreciative, but I wonder if it's harder to do the beef meatballs gluten free for some reason? Anyway, also happy to see the fries and tots are gluten free. That's not always the case because they're fried in the same frier as glutenous items usually. I honestly don't think I've had fries since I was diagnosed, and they were delicious! \\n\\nI was bummed to see Auroch's gluten free beer isn't on the menu here. I saw they were mentioned on IG as being at Mercato. I asked our server and she was like, no we don't have it, and walked away. I went to the bar to double check and they mentioned it was probably their other location, which I forgot about. So here's a plea to carry Auroch's downtown too!?\\n\\nGlad this can still be a dependable option while downtown!\\nThis is a vintage shoppers paradise!  The place is stocked full of o\\nriginal vintage finds from the 1920's and on.  It may be packed full but it's easy to navigate between the different decades as they are clearly marked in select sections.  The prices aren't outrageous if you're looking for something unique for a special dinner or event.  You can tell that the owner goes above and beyond to find the best vintage selections.  It's not just clothes too, but gorgeous jewelry and a very unique selections of vintage eyewear.\\nLet me just say this up front, because everyone needs to know, this place is delicious and packs some mean flavors into every dish. Oh... and it's vegan. But that should be an after-thought, because you will NOT miss meat here. You won't even THINK of meat here. You'll just think about how every bite is ridiculously good. \\n\\nEverything about this place is just stellar. The ambiance is warm and inviting, but also casual. You actually order at the front counter and then find yourself a seat. It's pretty tiny, but has a beautiful outdoor ar\\nea that's covered. I'm wondering what they'll do with the space in the winter, because it's great to have that extra space. There's beautiful floral arrangements on every table, shelf and counter. They really create a comfortable environment. \\n\\nWe ordered the Kartofle z jogurtem migdalowym. Don't worry, you'll probably have no clue how to pronounce anything on the menu other than Pierogi. The dish is potato, apples, lingonberry and yogurt. It's different, but delicious. The potato's were crisply cooked and the combo of the berry and yogurt was great. We also got the Kanapki, which is freshly baked bread (I believe baked in house) with different spreads on top. I wish I could remember what they were, but they rotate daily. Finally we had the pierogies, which are seriously a must get here. One was sauerkraut and mushroom and the other one is smoked potato, parsnip, and turnip greens with smothered yogurt and mustard on top. Both were incredible, but I liked the smoked ones the best. \\n\\nOn\\n the weekends, I don't doubt it's packed. So my advice would be to go early. We went right when it opened at 5pm and we sat right down. By the time we left at 6:30pm the place was packed! I'm not surprised, it should be packed because it's awesome!\\nLove love love! I cannot tell you how much I love this winery. It's right in the heart of Pittsburgh! WAIT, better yet... right in the Strip District! Our very own urban winery!\\n\\nYou must go visit their digs, I promise, you won't be sorry when you're sipping a delicious red or white! This space is really beyond words. As soon as you walk in you feel like you've traveled to some far away castle in a romantic foreign city. It's dimly lit, with beautiful dark wood and a fully stocked bar waiting for you to imbibe. \\n\\nThey have six wines right now, but the grapes are crushed fresh in house (or at least in the presence of the winemaker, Tim), so you know they're not rushing to produce a mass amount of products, just a handful of marvelous blends! \", 'actual_label': 22, 'predicted_label': 22}, {'text': 't if I do, they will be there ready to provide great service again.\\nThis place is beyond amazing. \\n \\nI have had this place on my radar since it opened and after all the great word of mouth I was dying to try it. I came here with a big group of friends and luckily there was one table that was able to accommodate us. The owner, David, was a fantastic guy. He was so personable and welcoming. He was joking around with us and very patient with us even though we were taking quite a bit of time deciding what to order in between conversations.\\n\\nOur table started with some appetizers and a salad to share. We got the Crying Tiger, which burned so good, the Malaysian Roti and some spring rolls. They were all delicious. I ordered the Massaman Curry with fried tofu. It was absolutely fantastic with all the unexpected combinations of flavors. Some other dishes we tried were the Red Curry, Pad Se Ew, Black Bean Chicken, Pad Thai with Chicken and another Massaman with Beef instead of tofu. Everything \\nwas perfectly flavored and the portions were generous for the price. \\n\\nChef Lisa came out to chat with us as well and she was incredibly friendly. We were joking back and forth about the one guy in our party who ordered a spicy level 10 and what that would be rated on the Thai spicy scale. She said a 7, but I think she was trying to be kind as David said it was more like a 5 to them, haha.\\n\\nIt was a fantastic evening with even more fantastic food and to top it all off she delighted us with a complimentary order of tempura banana which were excellent with bits of coconut inside.\\n\\nI can\\'t wait to go back to try the rest of their menu. I just might become regular very soon!\\nOk, I\\'m the first to admit that I\\'m not a big fan of thrift stores for anything, beyond used books for travel and dropping off donations, but this place is huge and organized. \\n\\nGreat little spot to \"treasure hunt\" as my fella calls it and there are plenty of non-used items to choose from as well. \\n\\nIt\\'s not for everyo\\nne and yet there is something for everyone here if you give it a shot.\\nWhen I\\'m in serious need of a caffeine fix, this place does the trick. It doesn\\'t have a drive thru, so not as convenient as some but sometimes cravings can\\'t be thwarted by a little detail like that. Service is standard and efficient.\\nI\\'ve been to the Peppermill quite a few times over the years. Usually for some late night grub after a night out on the strip. \\n\\nThe food is ok, nothing amazing. Pretty standard cafe food. The portions are enormous so I often suggest sharing as an option. \\n\\nOn this particular occasion I came just to sit with some friends and have a few drinks after work in the Fireside Lounge. This was actually my first time in that area of the restaurant. On previous trips I\\'ve usually had my fair share of drinks by the time I happened upon the restaurant. The lounge is actually really cool. It wasn\\'t too busy and there were lots of cushy sofas to sit on around cool looking firepits. \\n\\nI ordered a di\\net soda (because I\\'m trying to be good on weekdays), but sampled some of my friend\\'s Pineapple Upside Down martini, which was delicious! I look forward to another trip to this lounge for food and drinks.\\nI recently purchased a tv online and wouldn\\'t you know it, it arrived broken on delivery. Wah wah. Looking for a replacement, this was the only store in town that had a replacement. I arrived around 6 and customer service quickly requested assistance to help bring the tv in from my car. Friendly and efficient service and they already had my replacement at the front desk ready for the exchange. The whole process was easy and took about 5 minutes. Fantastic. I\\'ll definitely be back to this location.\\nFourth times a charm. I\\'m officially a Fanilow. I have had the privilege of seeing Barry Manilow four times now, twice at the Las Vegas Hilton and twice at Paris Las Vegas. \\n\\nIf you like Barry, you\\'ll like this show. I saw the preview performances at Paris and I have noticed quite a few chang\\nes (for the better) in the show. They have been able to intersperse all of his classics alongside some of his newer material quite effortlessly. \\n\\nEverything is fantastic in this show. I have seen the evolution and am so happy to see all the positive changes. \\n\\nGet ready to wave your glowstick and dance in your chair.\\nThis restaurant is absolutely adorable. I didn\\'t get the opportunity to try any of their food this time around, but we sat at the bar and had a drink and I enjoyed it so much I can\\'t wait to return to give their food options a whirl next time.\\n\\nWalking in, I was pleasantly surprised by the restaurant interior. It\\'s very spacious and super cute. The perfect place for a date night or girls night out. We walked past the dining area and settled in at  the bar. Seats are comfortable and bartenders were friendly and very attentive. They have just about every bottle you can imagine, so you can request just anything your heart desires. I went with The Chandelier, from the cocktai', 'actual_label': 23, 'predicted_label': 23}, {'text': \"l menu, but my friend wanted and White Gummy Bear and the bartender was happy to oblige. \\n\\nThe drinks were tasty and pretty reasonably priced. I debated ordering an appetizer while I was there, but decided to try to be good since we had just eaten dinner elsewhere. The food menu is extensive and everything seemed reasonably priced, so I look forward to coming back soon and trying some appetizers as well as entrees.\\nI have spent a lot of time at RC Willey in the past few months.\\n\\nI've had all different experiences during each visit but for the most part I enjoy shopping here. The high pressure sales gets to me sometimes but overall I usually enjoy my browsing experience and can find a couple of sales people who are attentive without being stalkers. My favorite area to shop is the clearance center. There are usually plenty of discounted items to be found in this area.\\nI have been to this Dollar Tree location on a number of occasions and I have to admit it's one of my least favorites in t\\nown. They rarely have a good selection and more often than not I walk out empty handed.\\nThis was my first visit to a Pei Wei and I didn't walk in with high expectations, but they didn't really live up to even the low ones I had set.\\n\\nHaving had the flu last week, I decided to stick to something mild and safe on my first real meal back. I ordered a bowl of wonton soup and a kid's size of lo mein. My fella had the sweet & sour chicken with white rice. \\n\\nI ordered in advance and when we arrived our meal was sitting on the counter ready for pick up. My soup was bland, good my stomach couldn't handle much, but under normal circumstances it was too boring to order with mushy bits of wonton floating around in it. The lo mein had a lot more sauce than I was expecting. It was overly sweet and I had a hard taking a bite or two before giving up on that mess. My fella didn't like his meal either so I don't expect to give them another visit any time soon.\\nI am not the biggest fan of BBQ, but I do h\\nave a hankering from time to time. We were recently in the area and decided to give this place a try. \\n\\nThey have a number of lunch specials, as well as day of the week deals. My mom opted for the full rack of spare ribs for $18,99 that comes with two sides and a corn muffin. For sides we chose grilled pineapple and garlic mashed potatoes. While we waited our server brought out their freshly made BBQ chips so we could sample all their sauces. She went over all the flavors and we sampled them all. \\n\\nOur meals arrived and the food was good. This is one of the better chains around and I would have no reservations about returning here for another meal if I'm in the mood for more BBQ, which is usually a rare occasion.\\nMy fella and I came here during a weekday for dinner. We had purchased the Travelzoo deal for two buffets with unlimited beer and wine. \\n\\nThe place was really dead. We came at a very off hour hoping to avoid crowds and we successfully did this. The staff was attentive and frie\\nndly and we never had to remind them for refills or to clear our plates. The line is kept very clean, which is a must when I visit buffets. They don't have a lot of selection and it's kind of difficult to find some things since everything is spread our so far apart. They take minimalist design to the max. They only have 4 or five dishes to choose from for each type of food, which is a little bit of a letdown. Buffets should be all about selection and they don't have a lot of choices. \\n\\nThe food was standard. Nothing amazing, but there were a few standouts. I did enjoy the salad bar. They allow you to pick all the ingredients you want and they mix them for you. That was probably my favorite part of the meal. The desserts were limited as well. I ended up with macaroons. They were very good. Warm and chewy, definitely another highlight of the evening.\\n\\nI have to note that our beers were overly carbonated and both my fella and I couldn't even finish half of our glasses. It was Bud Light, w\\nhich was expected, but it was so bubbly it tasted awful. \\n\\nFor the price, we didn't feel ripped off, but we definitely won't be going out of our way to return. Overall, we had a pleasant experience, but it's not one of the better buffets on the strip by any stretch of the imagination. The food is really two star, but the service bumped it up to three star for me.\\nI've never been a fan of Quizno's and this location in particular isn't great. The service is always subpar. When we approach the counter I always feel like I'm bothering them. They barely utter a word of greeting and can't seem to be bothered to even crack a smile or ask if we're ready to order. On every occasion I have been here I have to start the interaction which is a little annoying. We came here recently because I'm a Groupon addict and I just can't seem to resist. I'll stick to Firehouse Subs and Subway in the area instead.\\nI have had Honey Salt on my peripheral radar for some time, but always felt rather lackluster ab\", 'actual_label': 23, 'predicted_label': 23}, {'text': \"out actually trying them. I finally got the opportunity to give them a try for lunch and without keeping you in suspense, the food and service were as lackluster as I had anticipated.\\n\\nThey were pretty busy during lunch time but we were seated immediately. It took a while for our server to acknowledge us and throughout our meal this remained an issue. He would be attentive for a minute and then he'd disappear, promising refills and spare utensils and then not delivering on these requests. I resorted to flag several waiters and busboys down for a spoon to be able to eat my soup which was cooling off quickly and get refills on tea and water.\\n\\nOn to the food. I decided on the fried chicken sandwich since it seemed to have universally positive reviews. This came with fries and I opted for a cup of soup and bread pudding for dessert, which me and my dining companion shared.\\n\\nThe sandwich was nothing to write home about, it lacked any originality and didn't have much flavor. The fries were h\\nard and under seasoned and even the soup was dull. None of the flavors did anything for me. The bread pudding was fine, but it was not memorable in any way. \\n\\nAll the food just seems overly pretentious and lacking any sort of excitement in the flavor department. Even now, over a week later, I can barely remember anything about the food. \\n\\nI don't see myself coming back any time soon.\\nMy third favorite of the three Archi's locations around town. It's the farthest from me, so therefor the one I frequent least. \\n\\nAll my same favorite dishes apply to this location. Curries, noodles, soups and eggplant are always my favorite. I still steer clear of the chicken dishes. Pork, tofu, catfish and shrimp are the way to go usually.\\n\\nMy Thai obsession knows know boundaries and Archi's (all locations) is always there to feed the addiction. Cheap, clean, good service and food. That's all I ask for in a great restaurant and Archi's delivers every time. \\n\\nI don't order drinks here either. I hate having\\n to pay for refills. Only my favorite Archi's on Rainbow has a fountain.\\n\\nGood for the location and especially right before or after the movies.\\nThere is only one store I find more boring than Best Buy and that's a certain home improvement store I won't mention here. \\n\\nNeedless to say, I avoid Best Buy as much as I possibly can. I am not the type of person who feels the need to keep up with all the new techie gadgets and spend way too much money on these silly novelty items that will only be out of date in a month or two, so when I do find myself in need of a practical item from this store my ultimate goal is to get in and out as efficiently and cheaply as possible. \\n\\nI found myself in such a need recently and luckily the service here was friendly and relatively competent. I found a sales associate to help me locate the item I needed and I was in and out in no time. \\n\\nThat's all I can ask for when I'm shopping here.\\nI'm not typically a fan of Food-4-Less. I'll admit it, I'm a snob when\\n it comes to bagging my own groceries. On this occasion, I was in the area and needed to pick up a few items for home. I was so excited by the great prices and they had quite a bit more variety than I have experienced in other Food-4-Less stores.\\n\\nThe aisles were pretty well stocked and the store was kept pretty tidy as well. I found quite a few deals on the prepackaged items I was looking for, which is great. I definitely wouldn't be opposed to try this place out again, since I work in the area.\\nI wasn't too excited about trying Wahoo's, but we got together with friends last night and compromised on Wahoo's. \\n\\nYou order at the register and then they deliver the food to your table. The menu is extensive, verging on too many options. It was a little confusing and ended up taking us a little bit to figure out what we all wanted. I decided on the basic two taco combination plate. I ordered the grilled fish taco with spicy salsa, tofu taco, white rice (they served me brown by mistake) and \\nwhite beans. My fella got a chicken burrito combination and also a side fish taco. My friends ordered as well and we all got a cookie for dessert and found a booth. \\n\\nThe food took a bit of time to come out and unfortunately our meals came out quite a bit of time before  our friends. Once we all had our meals, we dug in. The food was a little bland, even though I asked for spicy on everything. The brown rice was dry and the beans wet. The flavors weren't too exciting either. The fish was a little dry and the tofu, although nice was bland. The food was plentiful but I only ate a few bites of the sides since they were lackluster. \\n\\nEveryone else seemed to feel the same way about the food. The cookie was ok, nothing special. I don't think I'll make Wahoo's a regular on our food rotation.\\nThis is a review for the casino property, not the rooms.\\n\\nI used to come here quite often when I lived in the area, before all the renovations a few years ago and I still make the drive from time to time.\", 'actual_label': 23, 'predicted_label': 23}, {'text': \" I liked it then and still like it now. It's a great little locals casino. They always have great offers, they have a good variety of restaurants and their promotions always seem to entice me to check it out. \\n\\nI don't gamble, but I enjoy all the different gathering places they have available on property. Even during the summer they have free locals access to the pool and fun outdoor concerts in the evenings.\\nJC Penney has never been a favorite shopping destination for me, but we had a gift card to spend so we decided on this location. The customer service was pretty good and we were able to get in and out with our purchase in a very short amount of time. The inventory seemed a little less old-fashioned and dowdy than other JC Penney's I have been to in the past.\\nFarmer Boys is a good alternative to the typical fast food in the area. I wanted a sandwich for lunch and although they are far from cheap, they have good quality food and it's as close as you can get home cooked food a a driv\\ne thru spot. \\n\\nThis particular location was a little speedier than others I've been to. Big fan of that since I usually avoid other Farmer Boys locations for that reason. The service was pretty standard, nothing made it stand out more than other drive thru restaurants, but it was solid. \\n\\nI can't attest to the service when you dine inside, but I would probably stop here again if I'm in the area.\\nNot really impressed with this place. I went to celebrate a friend's birthday and it just didn't blow me away. \\n\\nThis place is TINY! We had a pretty large group with us and there were also two other events going on in the bar area at the time. Knowing this in advance, you'd think they would have scheduled more than one bartender to man the bar! But no. Service was slow and labored. He did the best he could and there were some drinks available. I'm a big fan of The Hollywood. It definitely packs a punch. Looks like their happy hour was pretty reasonable, so that's a selling point.\\n\\nThe decor is \\njust all right. Nothing amazing and nothing I haven't seen 100 times before. Just all right. \\n\\nThe parking situation is a nightmare as well. There was no one manning the valet area and no one to direct people where to park. People in our party actually had their cars towed from having them parking in the wrong area. I think better signage would be helpful.\\n\\nOverall, just ok. Nothing that would entice me to come back for more.\\nI can't believe I've never written a review for this show. I've seen it on four occasions over the years and each time is like seeing it for the first time. I came for preview performances before it opened years ago and was blown away. Being a great fan of the Beatles this show paid homage in the best way possible. If only Viva Elvis had been able to capture the same awe and fantastical feeling that this show seems to.\\n\\nI won't rehash all the same things everyone else has said about the show, only say that if you haven't gone, go. If you have seen it, go again. It\\n's that good!\\nThis is a Walgreens I pass by on almost a daily basis but I rarely go in unless I am looking for something in particular. Well stocked and the service is decent.\\nI have dropped my iPhone on so many occasions I thought it was invincible. Well, I was wrong. Last weekend I dropped my iPhone and I cracked the screen in a million different pieces. I looked up a location to fix it on Yelp and this place popped up with a lot of positive reviews. I came in yesterday afternoon and they repaired it in just 30 minutes. I felt it was a fair price and it was fixed in a timely manner, so I was happy with the service I received and would likely recommend it to others who need their phones repaired on the cheap.\\nGreenland is probably my favorite Asian supermarket in town. The store has so much variety and is pretty well-organized and clean, which I enjoy. Everything is pretty reasonably priced as well. \\n\\nI don't shop there nearly as often as I'd probably like, probably because I don't re\\nally cook. I do try to get here about every month or so, just to get my fix. Also, as someone who doesn't really cook, I really enjoy their huge selection of premade items as well as all their inexpensive kitchenware.  \\n\\nAnother great place about this place is all the food vendors that are located in the mall area as well. I can usually grab some food to go on my way out for dinner as well, which is probably my favorite part about the place. Convenience is the name of the game here.\\nThat bread, though. Every time I think back to my exceptional meal at Streetcar Po-Boys, all I can think about is their amazing bread. Perfectly crusty and doughy, I would come back for that bread alone. Luckily, Streetcar has a lot more to offer than just mind-blowing bread. \\n\\nAfter hearing the recent rave reviews for this very new restaurant, I could not wait to give them a try. The decision to drive so far out of my way for lunch was made even easier with Yelp Deal they are currently offering.\\n\\nThe momen\", 'actual_label': 23, 'predicted_label': 23}, {'text': \"t we walked in we were greeted warmly by every server in the place. I was already impressed. The restaurant is larger than expected and very cute. Lots of booths with plenty plenty New Orleans flavor gracing the walls and sound system. Service was extremely attentive and friendly.\\n\\nMy mom and I decided to each get a sandwich and share an order of corn fritters. I went with The Bourbon Street and my mom ordered the Da Saints. Our food took a little while coming out since there was a very large takeout order being prepared, but our waitress kept us in the loop so we happily chatted and took in the ambiance while waiting.\\n\\nThe food finally came out and I was floored. We had both ordered the regular size po-boys and we were sure glad we did. These sandwiches were enormous and smelled so good. We dug right in and all the flavors were just perfect. Perfectly crunchy bread that complemented the very juicy and messy nature of my sandwich. I'm usually not a fan of food that is that messy to eat\\n with my hands, but it was so tasty I didn't mind. The corn fritters were delectable as well. My mom's favorite were the homemade chips, perfectly cooked and seasoned. \\n\\nRefills were plentiful and we each enjoyed our meals quite a bit. Try as we might, my mom and I both had an entire half of a sandwich to take home with us for later. I had been looking forward to trying some of their desserts, but we were just too stuffed. Next time my plan of action will be to share a sandwich, since portions are so generous.\\n\\nI will be back, and soon!\\nI have made it my mission to try to get to as many of my bookmarks in the area as possible. Today I found myself at 808. Malasadas were sounding pretty good for lunch, so I decided to give them a try. \\n\\nI ordered the red velvet filled with macadamia nut cream filling. I also tried the regular malasada filled with guava. This one was a little on the dry side, not as fresh tasting as I had hoped. I definitely preferred the red velvet. It had a nice textur\\ne and I really enjoyed the filling. I'm don't usually like filled donuts, but this was a treat. It was the perfect texture and wasn't too rich. I also got a spam musubi to fulfill my savory quotient for lunch. Honesty, the only reason I ordered it was because they have a $5 minimum credit charge and I just was slightly short. \\n\\nThe guys working there were friendly and efficient. I wouldn't go out of my way, but they're worth a try.\\nWith my friend and in need of a sweet to top off our foodventure for the day, we wandered into Tasty Crepes. \\n\\nWhen we walked in they were pretty empty, but in less than five minutes the place was packed. Good timing on our parts.\\n\\nWhen you approach the counter there are small order forms where you mark all the contents you want included in your crepe. They have sweet, savory and pizza crepes to choose from. I opted for a sweet version with strawberries, mixed berries, chocolate brownie ice cream and powdered sugar. My OG ordered a sweet with chocolate chip \\nice cream, berries and strawberry sauce as well as a pizza crepe with pepperoni and sausage I believe. They serve Thrifty's ice cream, so that's a nice blast from my past growing up in Southern California.\\n\\nWe took a seat and waited for our creations to be brought out to us. The crepes were good and I enjoyed the the filling quite a bit. The crepe itself was a little on the dryer, burnt side and didn't have the lovely softer texture that I have come to love. \\n\\nThe crepes are a lot bigger than I was expecting and we realized we were in over our heads with three crepes total. My friend ended up taking a majority of his pizza crepe home with him as leftovers. I didn't follow up with him to see how it held up, but I didn't expect it to. \\n\\nThe crepes were decent and it's a nice spot to grab a dessert and just chat with friends since they have a decent sized dining area with chairs and tables. Portions are large and decently priced for what you're getting so sharing might be a good idea if y\\nou're not super hungry.\\nHappy hour and reverse happy hour. My two favorite times of the day! Luckily Sierra Gold is there for me when I need it.\\n\\nThe pizzas are always a good choice. They're not fantastic, but they're cheap, which sells it for me.  \\n\\nI'm addicted to the Pretzel Bites and Pulled Pork Potato Skins.\\n\\nIt's my happy hour of choice when I'm trying to be frugal, but still feel like socializing.\\nOne of my main complaints about the Vegas movie scene is that we don't get as many independent movies in town as I'm used to. I'm originally from L.A. and one of my favorite things to do used to be going to watch avant garde and independent movies. \\n\\nMost of the theaters in town tend to carry the more mainstream fair, so it's nice that Regal Village Square 18 is my go to theater when I'm in the mood for something a little more off-beat or a foreign film.

I always end up here in the evening when most other donuts in the area are already closed.\\n\\nThe donuts have always been fresh and the service is always so friendly. The guys who work here are so nice, I really have to hand it to them.\\nThe drinks and desserts are the thing here. Wish I had the opportunity to try more of their sweets, but my dining companions had little appetites, lame. This leaves me with more incentive to come back and try all the yummyness. \\n\\nWe three girls shared the Tropical Goblet, which was absolutely delicious. Their drink menu alone left me wanting more. Our waitress promised that all the drinks actually tasted like the candies they \\nrepresented. I'll be back to try the Lollipop Goblet as well as the Blow Pop martini.\\n\\nFor dinner I had the brie and ham crepe. Not the best crepe I've had, but it was pretty good for what this place was. The bits of pear and arugula were fresh and the ham and brie were plentiful, so I wasn't disappointed.\\n\\nThe restaurant overlooks the strip and the windows are wide open to enjoy the view of the strip as well as the Bellagio fountains, day and night. \\n\\nI was dying to try one of the sweet pizzas or a sundae. Even the fondues were intriguing. It wasn't meant to be on this occasion, but the dessert menu was extensive and my will is strong. \\n\\nI'll be back! Open late, just like I like.\\nI have been on quite a few occasions since my initial review and the good thing is, things remain consistent here at 808 Tapas. That's definitely a good thing. Quality, presentation and service are all on point. \\n\\nService is always incredibly friendly and accommodating. Some of my favorite dishes are the poke\\n nachos, 808 roll, nasu fries, kalbi, garlic chicken and miso cod. Everything else that I've ordered has been solid as well. Even better, they often offer  Groupons and other discounts through restaurant. com. Definitely a safe bet in the area for dinner, happy hour or lunch.\\nWhy, oh why does this awful food court even exist. \\n\\nIn a resort with some of the finest dining in the city, this food court is an insult to any human with taste buds. \\n\\nWe were on property for a show and we decided to grab a quick bite in the food court beforehand since we didn't have time for a sit down meal.\\n\\nMy mom and I decided to share some nachos and a drink since we weren't super hungry. I stood in line next to some extremely obnoxious spring breakers and ordered my meal. When I first asked for nachos, I watched the guy in back making chips from scratch, so I started to feel a little more optimistic about our food court decision, but feeling soon faded. The girl at the counter topped the freshly made chips\\n with a sad amount of shredded cheese, ran it through the warmer and then asked if I wanted any salsas to go with that. Um, even for strip pricing I would expect a little more for my $10 than a sprinkling of cheese atop 20-30 chips... \\n\\nI asked her to add chicken and then proceeded to add every possible other topping I could think of to salvage this travesty of a meal. By the end, it looked decent enough. I paid and was on my way to the table my mom had secured.\\n\\nOne bite in and I was done. He chips tasted stale, despite watching the guy make them fresh and were so salty. The chicken was beyond dry and none of the salsas tasted like anything close to food. \\n\\nI cannot stress this enough, there are so many wonderful places to eat inside Venetian and Palazzo at the same price point or slightly more, that there is absolutely no reason anyone should need to eat at this pathetic little food court.\\nOver the years, I have tried to avoid visiting this Ross because their lines are typically over\\nly slow and their selection has been subpar, compared to other Ross locations. \\n\\nThe line situation seems to have improved a little bit, based on my last visit. I notice that a lot of Ross' seem to be experimenting with ways to improve the checkout times, which I know had been on my biggest complaints about the chain. They have put up racks for hangers in the line area to encourage customers to take their own purchases off the hangers while they wait. This is something I have always done to help expedite the checkout process and I do see it helped quite a bit. Despite the long line, it moved quickly and efficiently, so I do see improvements.\\n\\nThe selection was a little better than previous visits as well, so I do see myself coming here more often in the future.\\nI've come to this Carl's Jr on a number of occasions and have always received really friendly and attentive service here.

We were looking for some quick and cheap grub and I remembered this Kobe location that was near us. I have been to the one on Rainbow on numerous times, but this was my visit here. I knew they have a Happy Hour that pretty much lasts all day, so it made our decision easy. \\n\\nThe restaurant was pretty empty, but filled up while we were there. I took quite a while perusing the menu. The entire menu is half price during Happy Hour I decided on bento box since it seemed like the best value. My fella ordered some rolls and appetizer as did our friend. My other friend decided on a bento box as well. \\n\\nOur food came quickly. The portions were large and I was happy with most of the cooked things in my bento box. The katsu was pretty good and not overcooked, the salad was pretty fresh as well. My fella didn't enjoy his rolls so I ended up trading a majority of my bento b\\nox for his roll since I liked it better than he did. The spicy tuna was spicy but not as fresh and fell apart quite easily. The sashimi was not fresh at all. The flavor was really fishy and I ended up not eating this portion of my meal. My friends and fella were pretty meh about the dining experience as well. The prices were right, but I don't think I'll be back to this Kobe location.\\nAfter passing by Kauai Cafe on a number of occasions, i finally got a chance to try them out today. \\n\\nWe were greeted warmly and almost everything on the menu looked great. I decided on the kalbi plate and you get mac salad and a choice of fried rice, steamed rice or fried noodles, I chose steamed rice. My dining companion opted for katsu chicken. \\n\\nWhile we waited our server came out and chatted with us for quite a while and he was so nice and personable. Our food came out soon after and our jaws dropped at the generous portions. I enjoyed every bite and I had more than half my meal packed up to take hom\\ne with me. I was stuffed and so was my dinner partner. \\n\\nGreat big portions of delicious homemade food for such a low price, I look forward tk coming back soon.\\nThis was my first time volunteering with Three Square. \\n\\nI always wanted to go, but I finally got the chance to come fill up food boxes with my coworkers. The sign in process was quick and they set us up with everything we needed to get going and were helpful when we had questions or needed anything. \\n\\nI have heard great things about the organization over the years and look forward to helping out again in the future.\\nI have been slightly curious about Buldogi's over the years and when I came across an Entertainment book coupon for buy one get one free menu item free, I could no longer resist. \\n\\nI ordered the Gangnam dog which was topped with pork belly and pickled cucumber and my friend and I shared an angry kimchi fries, but switched out the sweet potato fries for regular fries. \\n\\nThe service was friendly and quick and we had \\nour food in no time. The food looked so pretty, it made for a perfect picture opportunity.\\n\\nMy dog was good, nothing to write home about, but it was decent and I enjoyed the toppings more than the actual hot dog since it got a little wrinkly and shriveled after the cooking process. The fries were well cooked. I have a feeling I might enjoy plain fries more if I were to come back, instead of the ones with all the toppings. The fries themselves were perfectly cooked and while I enjoyed all the toppings, including the nicely cooked egg, I found myself picking out the plain fries to enjoy by themselves.\\n\\nOverall, I enjoyed our meal, but I don't think I'd make this a regular stop on my foodventures.\\nWhat can I say about Art of Flavors that hasn't already been said.\\n\\nThe gelato is amazing. When trying to decide on a flavor you can't resist trying as many of the offerings as possible. They're irresistable. I have to admit I prefer some of the more unusual flavors, so that's a huge selling poi\\nnt to me.\\n\\nI'm disappointed in myself for taking as long as I did to give them a chance. I'll be back, and often. Luckily they also offer AOF at Novecento across town if I need to get my fix.I love it when local restaurants work together.\\nI have to say I am impressed with this place. \\n\\nWe arrived around 1pm on a Saturday and they weren't busy at all. You walk in and order at the counter. Since I had a Groupon, I opted for the family pasta meal, which included any pasta of your choice with choice of sauce, two toppings and cheese. We opted for the ravioli with broccoli, tomato and ricotta with marinara sauce. The meal also included house salad and garlic knots. \\n\\nOur salad came out first and it was amazing. This was the highlight of the meal. It was really nicely plated and at first we couldn't tell what the ingredients were as an apple ribbon was wrapped around the arugula.

Haven't tried any of \\ntheir food items. I strictly come here for dessert, usually after dinner in Chinatown. \\n\\nGood for what it is.\\nWe had the luxury of enjoying the private dining area to celebrate a birthday in our small group of seven. Arriving at 5:30, we were treated to a plethora of menu options and we all left full and happy. \\n\\nThe highlights of the meal were the chicken and waffles, farmer's cheese with watermelon, meat pie that wasn't officially on the menu at the time of our meal, bone marrow on toast points, chicken and biscuits and the fried green tomato BLT. Everything was decadent and prepared with love. Honestly, I can only think of one menu item that we tried that I didn't enjoy. The mac & cheese was decent, but didn't live up to the rest of the meal. It's the only thing I wouldn't order again, which is impressive based on the quantity of menu items we had the pleasure of trying.\\n\\nOf the desserts, my favorite was the black and blueberry cobbler. I'm a sucker for anything fruity and this live\\nd up to my expectations. I don't have a huge sweet tooth, but the rest of the desserts we tried were excellent as well. A table favorite was the chess pie. A little too sweet for my palate, I do understand the appeal and recommend it to those who enjoy sweeter dessert items. \\n\\nOverall, it was an excellent meal with great company and I look forward to coming back again soon.\\nI only ever seem to end up at the Cracked Egg with a coupon in hand. The breakfasts are always solid. Not my favorite in town, but they have quite a bit of variety and it's all pretty good. \\n\\nI have tried a number of things over the years and I tend to prefer their savories to sweets. Coffee cake isn't my thing, so despite all the raves, I have never ordered it more than once. The omelets usually draw my attention and they are good and cooked to order. Service is friendly, but the restaurant gets pretty busy so be prepared to wait or arrive early on weekends.\\n\\nNone of the dishes have stood out over the years, but if\\n you're looking for a basic breakfast stop, this is as good a place as any, just make sure you have a coupon.\\nI have had to downgrade this to a 3 star review because of the terrible service at this location. \\n\\nThe service is always SLOW, yet I always seem to come back for more, lol. I just can't resist the bar food and cheap drinks.\\nI'm not a big fan of DTLV and I wasn't super motivated to check out Gold Spike after hearing the comparisons of it to dorm social rooms, but I ended up here with friends are big fans, so I played nice. \\n\\nThe ambiance is odd. Kind of reminds me of a dated living room, but we had a nice time playing board games and having a few drinks. I think this was due to the company more than anything else. Once it started getting crowded, louder and a band started up, I had my fill and decided to head out. \\n\\nI see who this place would appeal to, but it's just not for me.\\nHmm. I don't really know how to review this place. We came this morning for the champagne brunch wit\\nh a pretty large party. The line was pretty long, but it went quickly and they were able to seat us relatively fast considering the size of our party. \\n\\nThere were many pros to this buffet. Once seated, our server quickly took our drink orders and we were able to go get our food. They have a pretty good variety of options and it's organized well. There seemed to be something for everything. The food was ok as well. \\n\\nNow, onto the con and it's one heck of a con. I unfortunately caught sight of a roach on the line, right on the waffle, biscuit and corned beef hash station and that obviously stopped my appetite in it's tracks. That's unforgivable in my book, I won't be back.\\nOne of the better Egg Works locations. The restaurant is more roomy and less crowded than others and I enjoy the ambiance quite a bit more. Even better, on a Sunday morning they were airing quite a few football games so my fella didn't feel like he was missing out too much by helping me satiate my breakfast food crav\", 'actual_label': 23, 'predicted_label': 23}, {'text': \"ing. \\n\\nThere was a bit of a wait, but once seated we were asked by three separate servers in a 2 minute period for our drink orders, so I was already optimistic on the service. My fella and I both went with iced teas which they were refilled regularly. I ordered the sundance omelet and my fella went with the quiche pizza. The quiche pizza was tasty, although I probably wouldn't recommend it simply because I would prefer more egg and less dough in my breakfast. My sundance omelet was really good. Cooked exactly as I requested and had lots of veggies and cheese in it. I also got cottage cheese in place of the potatoes. I've never been a fan of their potato spices, so this was a great decision on my part. \\n\\nOverall, our meal was excellent and we both left full and happy. Service bordered on over-attentive, but I dare not complain about that as I would prefer that to servers who are completely inattentive. I don't see myself becoming a regular here, but with a coupon for Groupon, I'm alway\\ns happy to come out for breakfast.\\nI've come here on a few occasions, usually while waiting for a table at Twin Creeks or just to sit and get a drink with friends after having getting our fill at one of the restaurants and having an after meal drink. The bar stools are a nice change of pace. Comfortable and welcoming. Always happy to have a comfortable seat while having a drink. The service is pretty good as well. Silverton always has great drink specials and this place doesn't disappoint.\\nAlways in the mood for matcha, I ended up here after a dinner with friends in the area. \\n\\nI opted for the soft serve swirl of matcha and hojicha while my friends all tried different items. They all seemed to enjoy what they ordered but I just wasn't but I just didn't enjoy the soft serve. It was overly sweet for my tastebuds. I typically enjoy matcha soft serve because it's not overly sweet but this one is definitely geared more towards people with a sweet tooth. \\n\\nI would love to come back to try th\\neir standard matcha tea presentations but I'll steer clear of their soft serve from now on.\\nI have tried the Chapala's on the west side of town before it closed several years ago and I didn't remember it being too memorable. On this occasion, my fella insisted we try this place and I gave in.\\n\\nOur server was friendly and we ordered the carne asada to share and snacked on chips and salsa while we waited. The chips weren't anything special and I found the salsas to be particularly unappealing. They were watery and had a sweetness that I didn't enjoy. \\n\\nOur meal came and it was plenty large enough to share. The meat was tough and had lots of fat bits I had to eat around. The rice and beans were decent, though.\\n\\nThe server was very attentive and refills were plentiful. I don't think I would be interested in coming back, but they seem to have faithful clientele.\\nThis Smith's location is just ok. It's definitely showing its age and is incredibly dated but the service and selection was decent\\n. \\n\\nI can't say I will make this a regular grocery stop but if you live in the area you could do worse in a store.\\nOn the hunt to get to more of my bookmarks during my lunch hour, I decided to give Pho Thanh Huong another shot. I came here years ago before I was on Yelp and thought they were good, but only if I happened to be in the neighborhood while craving Vietnamese.. They had pretty good sandwiches, but I just didn't end up back here again until today. \\n\\nI ordered a grilled beef banh mi and Thai tea with boba. The sandwiches looked a lot different than I remembered them. The French bread they use is enormous and much bigger than on my previous visit. The meat they used was a little different than I'm used to in banh mi. It was a little smokier than I like but very moist. It was a little on the messy side. They packed it to go in a way that was difficult to eat without dripping meat juice all over myself while I ate. The pickled veggies were hidden under the meat which made them a \\nlittle soggier and less crunchy. I'll have to ask them to put the veggies on top next time so they stay fresh and don't drown in meat juice. The bread was really great. A little breadier than I'm used to, more like a bolillo shape than French bread but very flaky and light. The Thai tea with boba was good. A little on the sweeter side, but still good. \\n\\nThe price is right, so I'll definitely give them another chance if I find myself in the area again. I was perusing the menu and their pho and other hot menu items seemed to run on the more expensive side compared to other pho restaurants I frequent. I think this is a good place to grab a cheap sandwich on the go.\\nI have been coming to these outlets since they used be called Belz. Honestly, I still call them that most of the time and probably won't stop any time soon. They have had a lot of renovation of this mall over the years and the result is positive.\\n\\nI always enjoy perusing the stores and kiosks when I'm in the area. Not a huge fa\", 'actual_label': 23, 'predicted_label': 23}, {'text': \"n of having the mall split up between the main portion and the annex, since I have to get back in my car and repark if I want to check out any of the stores on the side. Overall, I enjoy this outlet mall quite a bit and have been frequenting it quite a bit more lately since I work in the area.\\nIn the area and craving a sweet I decided to check my bookmarks and lo and behold Gimme Some Sugar popped up on my Yelp app bookmarks. \\n\\nHaving heard some good reviews from trusted Yelpers I was excited to give them a try. I walked in and the place is super cute. Clean and well-decorated. I was greeted warmly by the three girls working at the counter. They were ready for any questions and had plenty of suggestions for me while I perished their inventory. I had my heart set on a macaron and they are huge. Interesting flavors as well. I decided on the fig & goat cheese and the maple bacon. I also had some questions on some pricing for specialty cakes and towers and they were very helpful and assist\\ned me with all my questions and gave me lots of information and contact information if I decided to order something for the future. \\n\\nThe macarons were flaky and moist. I didn't love the flavors, but they were ok. I took a few bites and didn't really feel the need to finish them. I'd be back if I'm in the area to see what else they have to offer.\\nAlways on the lookout for new food options I was thrilled to find this spot. It's kind of hard to get to if you don't work in the area and have a regular 9-5 like me but luckily I was off one day and made the trek for lunch. \\n\\nTasty empanadas that come in many varieties, I stocked up on one of each so I could take some home and enjoy them later as well. \\n\\nFriendly service and homemade Argentinian treats, what's not to like.\\nI was in the neighborhood and looking for a quick bite to eat for lunch. \\n\\nThe good thing about this place is that they have a drive thru. Definitely a plus. I ordered the pollo verde burrito, minus the beans. The service w\\nas fast and my burrito was ready quickly. I liked that it was wrapped in foil, which makes it easier to east on the go.\\n\\nThe flavors were pretty good. I enjoyed the chile verde quite a bit. The flavors didn't blow me away, but it was tasty. I will definitely be back to try out the other burrito options that are also cheaper. The price added up pretty quickly, so $9 for lunch seemed a little steep. I saw some other burritos priced at just under $5, so I'll probably aim for one of those next time. \\n\\nDefinitely a good option for a quick bite on the go.\\nMy favorite thing about Marshall's is the shoe department and this one does not disappoint. Rows and rows of brand name shoes and a sizable clearance section make my shoe-aholic self tingle with anticipation. \\n\\nI don't frequent this location since it's clear on the other side of town from where I live, but when I'm in the area I always like to check it out for deals. Definitely clean and organized as well, which is a plus.\\nI have heard abou\\nt Bob Taylor's over the years figuring I'd get there eventually. After nearly 12 years living in Vegas, I finally made the trek for dinner with my guy and his co-workers. \\n\\nLocated in the middle of nowhere, this isn't a spot that you would just come across on your way somewhere else. The restaurant is located in a ranch as the name suggest and is somewhat of an institution since it has been around for so long. \\n\\nThey have kept the vintage vibe alive and well there. The service was ok, attentive at times but needed a nudge from time to time for refills and such. We started with a few appetizers that were not particularly memorable and their cheesy garlic bread which was one of the highlights for me. I decide on the prime rib since I had heard was one of the better selections. It was good, although nothing amazing. \\n\\nEach couple ordered a dessert to share as well. Our key lime pie was standard, yet tasty. The cheesecakes our dining companions ordered were not as well received. \\n\\nFor the \\nprice, it's not bad and I've heard their lunch is good as well so I might be interested in trying that some time. Otherwise, I'm happy I tried this spot but it might be one and done for me.\\nThis place was just ok. \\n\\nI was feeling lazy and wanted to get some delivery. Browsing through reviews on Yelp, I was happy to come across this place that delivered and had fantastic reviews. \\n\\nWe ordered a medium Hawaiian, chicken wings and some onion rings. The onion rings were soggy and gross. I kinda figured they would be from that long drive to my place, so I blame myself for that choice. The pizza was very underwhelming. I was so disappointed after reading all the rave reviews. The crust was blah, the toppings were blah, the only saving grace was the flavorful tomato sauce. The highlight of the meal were the chicken wings. They were really good. Great texture and flavor. The bleu cheese dressing that came with them wasn't great, but we just ended up dipping them in the hot sauce instead and yu\", 'actual_label': 23, 'predicted_label': 23}, {'text': 'a hour.

We ordered a Baja Roll (not bad) to start.\\n\\nI went to the bar to get a beer, stood for about a minute and then returned to my table.\\n\\nThe food arrived and sadly I was not impressed.  Bland would be the word best to describe the taco.  The steak on on boy\\'s bowl tasted microwaved and was also bland.

There is an old school 70\\'s style fireplace north of the bar.  Lot\\'s of Cariba\\'esque type decorations all over the place.  It\\'s a mix of Captain Ron meets Margaritaville but Margaritaville is down on Boulder Highway.  When the old dudes left, it got quite other than the mellow rock station.  The barkeep was not one for conversation, so I finished my beer and bailed.  Could be another decade be\\nfore I return but you never know.\\nStopped in recently to catch a Charger game and found that it was already catering to a Jets crowd.\\n\\nI have eaten at two of Winchell\\'s locations and found the Cuvee salad to be a most excellent suggestion.\\nStopped on a Saturday night without reservations and was able to grab a table without incident.\\n\\nThe table/booth..In the shape of a W, was whacky.  GF on one side and me on the other.  It was hardly conducive to snuggling what so ever.  I tried to make adjustments by contorting my body, only to think about visiting a chiropractor at the beginning of the week.\\n\\nThe vibe was unlike any steak house I have previously visiting.  I guess I am not hip (never really ever was) anymore.  Music was thumping making it hard to hear the GF, waiter or anyone else for that matter.\\n\\nI ordered up the Surf and Turf.  Turf was an 8 oz. fillet placed on mashed potatoes.  Surf was placed on top of the meat served with a red sauce.  I did enjoy this very much.\\n\\nIn the for ', 'actual_label': 24, 'predicted_label': 24}, {'text': 'me personally, I have discovered that \"mad beats\" absolutely impedes my digestion of animal flesh.  I just want to chill when dining on steak and not feel like I have to bob my head when I am eating.\\nFinally, after three visits over the past couple of years....the verdict is in.  Damn near 16 years in the Vegas before I paid Bob Taylor\\'s Ranch House (BTRH) a visit.  We visited and I withheld a review.  Visited a second time, withheld...yet another review.  The mystique of something that perhaps might have been special..once upon a time, kept me from pulling the trigger.  Maybe the next time it will be different....maybe the next time it will be different...\\n\\nMy brother and his family were looking for a place to dine on a Saturday evening.  I threw out a couple of options.  BTRH being one of them because it is in many ways just so damn different from what one is  used to living in Vegas.  Different being in it\\'s location and exterior and interior style but all this a great steak house d\\noes not make.....sadly.\\n\\nBack to my brother, I threw out several options....he replied back, \"Ranch.\"  He also made the reservations, that I highly recommend if this is but your first time visiting BTRH.\\n\\nBased on several experiences...the steaks are so so.  I found it them to be overcooked consistently more medium than the medium rare previously ordered. The simple garlic cheese bread is good to go, salads are good to go, the ranch house potatoes are good to go.  The service...mixed.\\n\\nNow that the mystique is almost certainly gone.  I don\\'t hate.....but I don\\'t love either.  We shall see what the future holds.\\nOut in Providence, you sort of have to roll out a few miles to get the things you need.  DPS is the middle man at the half way point.  Sure the owners should have the architect who designed the layout\\'s head examined.  If your looking at getting some type of franchise to occupy the other half and use the DPS drive-thru, again..you should have you head examined.  Because it is ti\\nght quarters all the way....the parking lot just plain sucks.  If I lived in the complex which borders the property, I would move as soon as my lease was up....The traffic/parking. sucks.  Some prices on certain prices are elevated, want cheaper...head down the road.\\n\\nAll negatives aside...it is a quick one shop stop.  Yes...on some items, slightly elevated prices.  \\n\\nThe beer selection is good in a pinch.\\n\\nThey have a F\\'real ice cream machine!\\n\\nAll things considered it\\'s A-OK if your in the Providence area and don\\'t want to east of Hualapai.\\nOne of the larger BFMG\\'s I have been to.  Due to it\\'s size, I did not even feel the lunch rush.  This one is clean.  The food is tasty and the staff is friendly.\\nI have been back a few times over the past year and found the coffee to be to my satisfaction.  Most importantly I felt welcome.\\nIt\\'s a hobby shop for boozers!\\n\\nFantastic prices and information overload regarding all things that make you happy!\\nCame down from the highlands of Providence t\\no meet a buddy at this particular alter of the Seattle java deity.  Not a damn thing I could do about it....it\\'s just the mature of getting coffee these days.  \\n\\nLocated in the booming area of the southwest corner of MLK & Lake Mead, you got a McD\\'s and the FBI in the immediate area.\\n\\nThis location was one of the more friendly I have visited.  After a pleasant transaction, I took in the wide open space and almost utilitarian feel of the joint.  All business as Starbucks is known for.  Not to comfortable but not uncomfortable either.\\n\\nThe drink (Dirty Chai) of the past 8 months was on point.  The breakfast sandwich liked any sort of soul, but made up for the empty space in my stomach.  \\n\\nOverall, I felt good vibrations and would not hesitate to meet a buddy again at this location.\\nSan Diego has it, Chicago has it, New York has it, DC has it and so do we but it\\'s not like theirs.  So what I say!  I\\'ll take trip to explore the treasures of Egypt or see what life is like in the Serengeti. \\n Yes it\\'s downtown but once you walk through the doors you can escape the hustle of the BLVD.\\n\\nLot\\'s of interesting things to see for $10..Kids are $5.\\n\\nBe sure to check out the Wild Nevada Gallery.  It is fascinating to see what life exists in the desert that surrounds us.\\n\\nThere is also Marine Life Gallery.  Be sure to say hello (Don\\'t touch) the neurotic ray that just keeps swimming around in circles and circles and circles.\\n\\nThere are many other displays to feast your eyes on soak in little tidbits of knowledge.\\n\\nJust remember it\\'s not the Guggenheim it\\'s our own little old school Vegas version of it.\\nThe GF and I were looking for a nice, romantic place to enjoy dinner in the Centennial area.  Not wanting to go anywhere near the strip on Saturday night, I pulled out the yelp stone and gazed heavily upon it.  After refining my search and reading the NBIB reviews, I used the yelp function to make a reservation.\\n\\nNBIB is located inside Bogies.  This may or may not have changes names m', 'actual_label': 24, 'predicted_label': 24}, {'text': 'any times since I have been here in Vegas.  I have not so many fond memories of slinging concrete back in 96\\' west of this location.  I was very excited to give this a shot.\\n\\nAgain, I waved my hands over the oracle that is yelp, and used a not so often used (in my world) reservation function. 8:00 PM, was the time.\\n\\nUpon our arrival, we were greeted in the space between Bogies and NBIB by our host.  We told him we had a reservation and he seemed confused, and this made me confused.  He told us he would talk to management and quickly returned to show us to our booth.  You can definitely smell the age of Bogies on the other side, there shorter time you spend in this area...the better.\\n\\nWe sort of dressed up for the occasion, business casual.  We found the restaurant to contain others that dressed up and a few who were dressed pretty casual.\\n\\nOur waitress was prompt and super friendly.  We ordered a bottle of wine, which the bartender quickly brought to the table and put on ice.  Bread wo\\nuld eventually follow, and was fresh and tasty.  We ordered up some garlic bread and the first batch was awesome.  A second batch, not so much as every piece was marred by char.  This was quickly rectified and did not reflect on the bill.\\n\\nThe waitress returned and we were ready to order.  We ordered up a Caprese Salad.  The tomatoes were fresh and delicious as was the Mozzarella.\\n\\nI ordered up the Chicken Marsala.  It was wonderful!  The combination of bountiful mushrooms and tasty garlic was amazing!\\n\\nThe GF ordered the Linguine con Gamberi e Funghi. The linguine was cooked to perfection. The shrimp and mushrooms were righteous.  The creamy tomato sauce was smooth as silk.\\n\\nWhile dinning a very nice gentleman, sadly I do not know his name, sat down and explained NBIB\\'s error on the reservation.  I appreciated his time and sitting down is always a nice touch.\\n\\nFor dessert, we went with a slice of Spumoni pie.  It was an excellent way to finish off the meal.\\n\\nIf your up in the area and\\n looking to not travel down into the bowels of the valley for a nice Italian dinner for two (or more), give North Beach Italian Bistro a shot!\\nDamn it..I really liked chilling out at OHC watching what was on the TV, enjoying a DFH beer and sampling whatever tasty cigar was recommended.  I met up with a buddy on a pleasant Saturday afternoon to do just that.  &%*@!, what do I spy...a head shop sort of feel upon entry?!-Narcotics paraphernalia?!  It\\'s hard to chill out like a \"gentleman\" in the presence of meth pipes and the like.  Sadness....\\nMy partner and I took our dear leader out to lunch for Boss\\'s Day.  Lobster ME had been booked marked for a little bit and on this occasion it seemed proper to pay it a visit.  There were some concerns about attempting to negotiate the Venetian during lunch time.  As fate would have it after parking in the garage and getting off the elevator, and getting off the elevator we were able to locate LME in the area of the food court with ease.\\n\\nThe set u\\np is straight forward.  You order and find a seat.  The service was friendly and offered up their knowledge of the menu, and individual favorites.  I went in on an \"Original Lobster Melt.\"  I found it to be...of course cheesy but was not lacking in lobster pieces and flavor.  I also complemented by sandwich with an order of \"Chowder Fries.\"  These are freaking awesome!  Fries smothered in clam chowder, cheese w/ bacon!  \\n\\nAfter eating our meal...we made or way out the area just as quickly as we found it.  While making our way out of the garage, I reflected on the meal and enjoyed it\\'s rich and stuck to the ribs quality.  You can\\'t eat like that every day but if you do or are thinking about it....give LME a shot!!\\nFausto\\'s in general is damn good.  This location is no different.\\n\\nIt can get a tad busy at times which makes for cramped quarters inside.\\n\\nI called in my last order over the phone.  Imagine my surprise when the lady taking my order said, \" five minutes.\"\\n\\nI hustled there in m\\ny vehicle and my food was already to go.\\n\\nCalling in the order will be the way to go from here on out.\\nI believe it is true when they say flying is safer then driving.  With all the advancements in aviation technology, I have even more faith, that statement is true.  But is by some strange cosmic roll of the dice, I was to dine at DATG, get on a plane, then impact Terra Firma traveling at 600 knots, I would absolutely, positively not want this to be may last meal.  Hell, I would rather take a Chex mix packet over this slop.\\n\\nI take a certain pride in living in Las Vegas.  I am actually proud of your ability to get millions of visitors in and out of Sin City to have fun and contribute to our local economy.  It is with a heavy heart, I find that we offer those coming to and going away in the unsecured portion of McCarran International Airport this pig slop.  \\n\\nIf I just arrived from parts unknown and have by passed what the individual terminals have to offer and am met with Don\\'s as a di', 'actual_label': 24, 'predicted_label': 24}, {'text': 'ning alternative, this is a sad, sad, reflection of what our city has to offer.  \\n\\nIf I am dining with a loved one prior to them punching out somewhere else in the country or world, it is absolutely vulgar this could be our last meal together.\\n\\nBehind the facade of what appears to be a Tex Mex or Mexican style restaurant lays the cafeteria hell.  After perusing the menu anything off the Latino menu was out of the question.  Wanting to be safe, The GF (who was heading out of town) and I decided to share chicken finger and fries.  Water was fluid to wash it down because charging over $3 for a fountain drink is just plain ole price gauging.\\n\\nThe chicken fingers took over 15 minutes to be served and when they did show up the fries were barely warm.\\n\\nWhile waiting for the our \"meal\" I watched as the servers conducted themselves in a manner befitting the federal government.  Imagine the attitude one would receive while standing in line at the Social Security office.  Better yet.....Imagine i\\nf the TSA was serving your food!  Rude, condescending, I watched one.. the order taker talked to a non english speaking traveller with ZERO compassion or empathy, while the traveler attempted to understand the establishment\\'s menu.\\n\\nBack to our order, the fingers where surrounded in a breading similar to that of the Carbonate Han Solo was encased in.  As previously mentioned, the fries sucked. After watching other patrons plucking who knows what off their meals while making funny faces, I told the GF to stop eating because I did not want her married to a toilet while she made her trip across the country.\\n\\nDear McCarran International Airport and Clark County Department of Aviation,\\n\\nWe can do better this.  Don Alejandro\\'s Texan Grill is an embarrassment to our community.  The location is prime and surely could do better to represent our town while they are either coming or going.  Ditch the small town cafeteria fell for something sparkly and that won\\'t turn your guts inside out.  You wi\\nll probably make even more money with a business who gives a damn about what they serve, including the manner in which they provide it.  \\n\\nIn the end I earned a \"Maverick\" yelp badge.  Though cool, it was my bad for not consorting yelp before entering.  The \"Mav\" is earned by going against the grain and going someplace despite it\\'s POOR RATING!\\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\nPaul W.\\nThe boy wanted Nachos and so I thought that after so many months have passed we would give it another shot.\\n\\nNice to see that they are offering the entree size Nachos again instead of the appetizer size for the entree price.\\n\\nThe waitress was very nice and said that after much rotation of staff things are starting to settle into a routine.\\nMy first visit was when I realized this location was trending on yelp awhile back.  I visited on a Saturday afternoon.  I ate a sandwich.  I liked it.  I can\\'t remember what it was.  But...I know I liked it.  And so....my review would wait. That was until...I was tasked with the answering \\nthe question, that is..similar to answering the question of one\\'s existence.....\"Where are we going to eat lunch?\"  Remembering how much I liked TSS, I threw it out there.  I was happy it was accepted..now I could write a review.  Upon our visit, the one thing I noticed right off the bat, was the staff was not as helpful as I last remembered on my previous visit. I started to panic, but when I spied the \"The Winston Cooper\"  I knew everything would be alright.  The Winston Cooper incorporates a delicious combination of hot pastrami, roast beef, and salami.  You get your choice of cheese, i chose American.  I wanted everything on it.  This included Mayo, Mustard, Secret Sauce (Garlic/herbs & Olive Oil), Lettuce, Tomato, Pickles, Onions & Peppers.  I asked for a side of \"Bomb Sauce\"...this beauty is a fusion of Ranch and Jalapeño.  I chose the \"Dutch Crunch\" for bread.  It was a solid roll. This excellent sandwich was paired with some chips and a fountain drink.  If your looking for drin\\nk to just go with a sandwich, check in...your gonna get a drink for free (As of October. 2015).  Overall, I found the ingredients to be very fresh.  I look forward to visiting again!!\\nWhen the office wants coffee, I believe that it is not my place to rant about my perceived evils of the \"mom and pop coffee shop slaying mega corporation.\"\\n\\nWhen in Rome, I don\\'t mind this particular location.  They actually have comfy chairs reminiscent of the old places I would visit.  Being comfortable helps assist with conversation and people watching (lot\\'s to do at this location).\\nWhat can one say when the parking lot presents many obstacles ranging from gas pumps, power poles, and above all else other patrons.  It\\'s a mine field but one has to negotiate if your want all manner of sundries.  \\n\\nOn a recent visit I had a gentleman back into my vehicle and together we were able to handle the situation in a gentlemanly fashion.  I have to blame that one on pilot error and not so much the P-lot.  \\n\\nOn my', 'actual_label': 24, 'predicted_label': 24}, {'text': \" most recent visit, I had to dodge those coming and going but will chalk it up to the morning rush.\\n\\nWhat makes this location particularly appealing is location, location, location....Cheyenne & 215.\\n\\nThe other factor which makes the running the gauntlet worth it is the employees.  The prices are so so and need I say again one runs the risk of striking or being struck BUT as far my own experiences have shown me, is the employees are with smiles and friendly.\\nWalking in I had memories of my mother taking me to a fabric store.  I used to watch as the clerk would undo a swath of material and then magically... i would end up in a pair of corduroy pants and some other pant or shirt pattern befitting the late 70'sor early 80's.  When I returned to reality, I realized how busy this place was.  Bless you, all you little boys and girls out there whose Mom's still possess the incredible ability to sew.  The GF and I roamed around looking for fabric for curtains.  Not one time were we ever approa\\nched and or greeted by any employee.  We also did not find anything which we wanted to make curtains out of.  Perhaps it was because they were overwhelmed due to having more people shopping than even I expected.  Thank God this is the GF's thing, as I know nothing about such things.  And also because the memories turned to nightmares. as I remembered homemade overalls and paisley patterned button up shirt.  The store kind of sucked but to all those that still rock a seeing machine....you are AWESOME!\\nA nice and friendly place to grab some breakfast.\\nAs far as Tropical Smoothie Cafes go, this one is good to go.\\n\\nNice and clean and the staff is always very friendly.\\n\\nDon't forget your punch card! 10th one is free.\\nIf I was stuck on a desert island with just one menu to eat from it would be from Del taco.\\n\\nGod only knows how many times I have eaten chicken soft tacos, quesadillas with extra green sauce and 99 cent red burritos with extra cheese.\\n\\nAs for this location...\\n\\nNever had any pro\\nblems with the drive-thru.  As far a presentation and packaging for the meal it was good as good gets a going through a drive-thru. This is the reason for the three star rating.\\n\\nAs for dining on the inside, well that's another story...I won't do it again.\\n\\nOn a recent outing I stopped in to have lunch.  Retrieved my order and went to sit down to eat.  It was then that I noticed the tweaker sitting there with no food charging his cell phone on an outlet in the dining area.  He left shortly via the back door shortly after I started eating.\\n\\nNext was a vagrant that snuck in via the back door.  He tried sneaking up to the drink machine to fill some jug that he had brought in with him.  Some how someone in the back noticed him.  They told him to leave and he did cursing them out as he left through the back door.\\n\\nThat back door is not safe, it's dangerous, don't eat inside!\\nDon't let the siren's song at the menu taking your order fool you into believing that this Del Taco is special....It'\\ns not.\\n\\nWhile at the check out window, the cacher/server was anything but nice.\\n\\nAfter taking our sizable meal down the road to grind.\\n\\nWith each undressing of the wrapper revealed that we were in for one terrible meal.\\n\\nChicken soft tacos that looked like made in a nuclear reactor, to the soupy quesadilla that we tried desperately to keep from staining our pants.  Everything lacked any of that quick efficient tasty chow that I know DT is capable of making.\\n\\nMy poor buddies guts were absolutely trashed for the remainder of the day.\\n\\nShame on you lazy DT cooks.....shame on you!\\nSo many places to stop for fuel.  So many places to stop for sundries.  I stopped in picked up a few things and went to the counter to conduct my purchase.  The grumpy dude with money tail behind the counter was a d!&%.  In fact.. he showed more pleasantries to a woman trying to commit petit larceny instead of the paying customer.  Next time I will spend my hard earned cash across the street ,or the street after \\nthat, or the street after that, and so on.\\nI have had many meals here over the years and sampled many an item off the menu.  It is true that breakfast at BBH is great.  I would rate it a four star no doubt.  Today I hopped in for lunch with the GF.  I went with the chicken salad sandwich and she went with the chicken breast salad.  My sandwich was pretty dry..my bad for not requesting the bread to be toasted.  The GF had to surgically slice off bits of cold chicken fat from the chicken breast.  It was painful to watch.  I kept asking her if she was alright to which she affirmed while continued to excise the meat.  The staff was friendly and she did not raise a ruckus.  By the end our table was quite messy with chicken breast parts and dry toast when we finished.  The staff is always friendly and breakfast is always delicious......I think I stick to eggs and pancakes next time.\\nStopped in for lunch at what was initially thought to be before the lunch rush (11:00), thought...wrong.  Lot'\", 'actual_label': 24, 'predicted_label': 24}, {'text': 's of real estate already occupied and a pretty good line had formed prior to our arrival.\\n\\nWhile eyeing the menu, I decided on the rolled tacos.  In addition, I noticed they had not carne asada fries (they do serve them) but onion rings!  The picture of them looked spectacular!  They came in a small and large plate which my buddy agreed to share small order with me.\\n\\nWhen it came time to place my order, I told the cashier I wanted the rolled tacos and the small order of carne onion rings.  She then told me the rings came in one size, large.  I congratulated her on up selling me and said let\\'s do it.  I then ordered up a carne asade burrito with sour cream and cheese for my boss back at the office.  She told me (which I already knew) they were extra.  I told her that\\'s fine.\\n\\nWe then took a seat and waited for our order.  I should have known something was up when another customer was arguing with the cashier about his order.  It created an awkward vibe.\\n\\nWhen my order number was called \\nout, I went to retrieve my lunch.  I then noticed instead of onion rings, I got fries plus there was no burrito.  The fries looked really good and I decided not to push the issue other than the location of the missing burrito.  \\n\\nThe cashier was smug thinking I had not ordered it even though the time lapse was only about eight to ten minutes.  She smirked at me and said \"where is your receipt?\"  I told her I would be right back.  I brought it back and she took it to one of the cooks.  They stared at it before grabbing some wrapped up burrito of the counter.  The cook then unfolded and added the items I had previously paid for.\\n\\nI can\\'t lie...the food was good.  But the messed up service ruined the experience for me.  I ate the fries but my mind drifted as I wondered what the hell those carne asada onion rings would have tasted like.  I guess I will never know...at least at this location because I won\\'t be back.\\nBeen here a couple of times.  Once right on the cusp of the witching hour t\\nhat is dinner.  The other time was the lull between lunch and dinner.  Witching hour busy....lull not so much.  \\n\\nBased on the two experiences, Algobertos is GTG (good to go).  The service has twice been friendly and smiley.  \\n\\nThe menu is very similar to another establishment that ends with...\"tos.\"  \\n\\nThe food is a solid A-OK.  This is based on a mean average of earlier orders (carne asada burrito w/ cheese, sour cream and guac plus a quesadilla) dating back to the 80\\'s. When I saw my brother on the first bite, spit out a chunk of gristle on the most recent visit, I braced myself for a similar experience.  One runs the risk of that at a \"TOS\" style joint cruising down the carne asada highway.  Luckily, I was GTG.\\n\\nWhen in need of chow, this is an absolutely A-OK option!\\nI have ordered from here several times over the past couple of years.\\n\\nWhether calling in the order or picking it up, the staff is always friendly and accommodating.\\n\\nPizza is a tad more pricey than the other retail p\\nizza places, but the quality is also a tad better also.\\n\\nIn addition to the pizza\\'s, they also serve sandwiches, salads and pasta dishes.\\n\\nWhile the pizza is round it is chopped into smaller squares for consumption.  This technique justifies taking half the pizza and making pizza legos on your plate.  \\n\\nBeware the center squares if not eaten right away will eventually turn into little cheese pucks that will slide right off the crust and onto the floor or your lap.\\nRolled into the immeasurable giant of java for a quick caffeinated beverage before heading on the 215 while bouncing home.  No inside service on this particular day as I stayed inside the comfort of my vehicle and pushed through the drive-thru.  The service was friendly enough, and my drink was just as SB pretty always does.  A solid A-OK experience when needing a sip of life\\'s blood before whatever it is you have going on.\\nI have been to this location twice now and had a great experience both times.\\n\\nBoth times I have ordere\\nd the Carne Asada burrito with sour cream, cheese and avocado.  The Carne Asada is moist, tasty and I have yet to get a fatty piece.  Ina edition to the burrito I get a side of beens and rice. The beans are without a doubt the best that I have tasted without it being someone\\'s family recipe.\\n\\nLunch can get very busy but they turn and burn on the orders and it comes out fast.\\nIt was an A-OK experience as convenience stores with a gas station go.  I was greeted coming through the door.  I was able to locate what I needed with ease.  The clerk behind the counter was friendly while completing my purchase.  Funny\\'s was clean and they also have Thrifty ice-cream.\\nAlways come here hungry and leave stuffed.\\n\\nThe primary motivation for driving as far as I do to dine here is the Sangria.  The red kind.\\n\\nToday my GF and I branched out and ordered the the Blackberry Sangria.\\n\\nUpon it\\'s arrival my GF noticed a strange fungus like sheen on one of the Blackberry that was placed a garnish in my GF\\'s g', 'actual_label': 24, 'predicted_label': 24}, {'text': 'lass.  I snatched up the first employee I saw and told them to get my waiter or the manger to our table ASAP!\\n\\nThe manager arrived, I was pissed and he took away the Blackberry in question.  He came back and told me that is not fungus but some discoloration of the berry.  He told me that the drinks would be taken care of.\\n\\nSwitched glasses with the my GF and continued on with my meal.\\n\\nMy meal consisted of the Pasta Rambo (like name) with lobster.  When I tasted GF\\'s Pasta Weesle, I wish that I would have ordered that instead.\\n\\nWhen we received the bill it was reviled that the manager had lied to me about \"taking\" care of the Sangria.  Not looking for any kind of damn handout just don\\'t stand there and lie to me.\\n\\nLater.\\nI have been to Divine Eatery (DE), multiple times. I have put off review, after review, waiting for something magical to happen.  After approximately five visits, I felt it was time to document.  \\n\\nDE...is as the crow flies...just short of mile from the domicile. A res\\nidence that I have inhabited for almost half a decade.  Maybe there should be be more check-in\\'s.....I don\\'t know.\\n\\nOn the most recent visit, I met the GF as she was coming off shift for some breakfast.  The DE was what was decided upon.\\n\\nI arrived first and found not much happening on a beautiful, unseasonably warm Saturday morning.  Many a table option to choose from.  I sat and sipped on my coffee and water waiting for the GF.\\n\\nLooking at the menu I decided on the \"Chilaquiles\" which consists of \\n\"Freshly deep fried corn tortillas, slow roasted pulled pork and smothered with salsa verde then topped with 2 eggs, queso fresco and chive sour cream\" (Retrieved from https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/divine-eatery-7181-n-hualapai-wy-115-las-vegas/348582?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIu7TA1fWN2QIVT2x-Ch1u2Qt5EAAYASAAEgKRYPD_BwE&utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=Las%2BVegas%2C%2BNV%2B%7C%2BLas%2BVegas%2C%2BNV%2B%7C%2BRestaurants&utm_term=%2Bdivine%20%2Beatery%20%2Bmenu&efkwid=274867955246&e\\nf_id=WnfbGQAAAAF-rBOV%3A20180205041916%3A).  Wow!! I was not expecting that URL!  When it arrived the chips were for the most part....soggy.\\n\\nI also ordered up some linked sausage and an a half order of \"Funky Monkey.\"  It\\'s French Toast with a peanut butter whipping cream and a sugar torched banana thrown on top.  Hell!  It was a cheat day!\\n\\nThe chow was three stars as was the service.  I thought whole thing could have been maybe a four....but when your coffee cup runneth empty, and there is not happening in the restaurant and it sits there for what seems FOREVER...and nothing happens, a breakfast joint is gonna loose a star.\\n\\nGiven where DE sits in the brain housing group after all the experience....I give it....three stars.  Thank you.\\nI stopped in for a quick beer and some boneless wings.  The same vibe as any other BWW\\'s.  The service was friendly and the meal was the same standard one can expect at any Buffalo Wild Wings.\\nThe last time I was at TS was approximately 10 years ago. \\n Heard the gents in the office talking about who their boss sweats when they do lunch there.  Beads of sweat a rolling off his brain housing group when the level 10 of hotness is ordered.  \\n\\nIt just so happened I was in the area and suggested to the GF and the Boy about paying the place a visit.  It was determined we would pay a visit on a Monday late afternoon for some chow.\\n\\nThe parking lot was not full and so I took this a lucky sign.  Rarely (VERY), do I ever get lucky parking and on this particular occasion I litterally parked in the front of the front door.\\n\\nWalking in TS was smaller then I remembered.  The half booths along the wall were very comfortable.  The area around the table smelled wonderful with jasmine.\\n\\nService was in every way on the slow side.  This is annoying especially when the restaurant is not busy.\\n\\nI ordereed up some Thai Spice Beef.  Sautéed strips of beef served over some crispy rice noodles.

Overall 3.5/5.\\nI didn't gamble here, but I did see a comedy show at the Ovations theater. The seats were the fold-up kind, but there were padded enough that they were still comfortable for the show. Our seats were in the second section, and you could still see the stage clearly. They have 2 large screens on the stage so those that are sitting further away can see the main act better. Sound was good and we had no problem hearing anything. Unlike other comedy venues like the Celebrity Theater, parking was easy and there wasn't any traffic getting in and out since there are multiple exit and entry points. Also, since the theater is at a Casino, you have a wide selection of food to choose from to eat before or after the show. Overall, \\na nice theater to see a show.\\nA spacious Bookman's to fulfill all your entertainment and pop culture needs. We browsed around and found a diverse selection of board and card games, DVDs, blu ray discs, books, and collectibles (Just to name a few). The different sections are easily found and clearly marked and I love the idea of reduce, reuse and recycle, the pop culture version!\\nConveyor belt sushi!  Average type sushi for rock bottom prices.  Most of the dishes we got were $1.50, but prices will range from $1 to $2.50.  If you get rolls, there are usually about 4 pieces on one plate.  Larger rolls such as the Las Vegas Roll (which is deep fried) will come as 3 pieces.  They have the usual suspects of sushi: salmon, maguro, yellowtail, bbq eel, as well as octopus, squid, and the uncommon conch (which was too rubbery and tasteless for me).  As well as sushi, you can find ramune soda, pudding cups, orange juice, and various desserts.  They had cream puffs and cheesecake for today's desse\\nrt.  Our total for 2 people with sodas was ~23 dollars, not bad for a sushi dinner!\\n\\nP.S.  If you order soda ($1.75), it comes in a prepackaged plastic bottle so no unlimited refills, but it will give you ~2 drink cup's worth.\\nSolid choice for Mexican food.  The best item I've had here is the Lisa Special, a large, buttery grilled quesadilla with chicken, green chile, and cheese.  The family that works here is friendly and eager to please.  Service was very good!\\nBest hummus I've ever had\\nI've been craving it ever since I first ate here a few weeks ago\\nUnfortunately, no credit card accepted\\nBut good stuff nonetheless!\\nI've had the Hale wall-installed pet door since 2013 and it's held up great. The dogs get easy access to the backyard, and the double flaps ensure that no critters or debris gets inside. We did a self install and it wasn't too hard to do, although they do have service people that will come out and install it for you if you wish. They are also a local company, and I love t\\no support high quality goods that come from our own state!\\nVery friendly and fast service, and they offer free soft serve!  The bbq itself is a bit pricey for the amount and quality you get though.  Although the bbq chopped brisket is one of their signature dishes, I found it was a bit too chopped for my liking, since the pieces of meat were very tiny which made it hard to eat.  They offer 3 different types of bbq sauce to go with your meal: original, sweet, or hot.  They all seem to originate from the same base, with a few extra ingredients added.\\nStill recovering from some sort of mystery stomach bug, the only thing I could eat last week without feeling sick was plain chicken and vegetables. Also not feeling like cooking due to my broken stomach, I headed over to this Boston Market location for a half chicken individual meal. You get your choice of two sides with the meal and I went with the steamed vegetables and green beans. Service was friendly fast and efficient. I was out the do\\nor in no time.\\n\\nThe chicken was tender, well seasoned and juicy. The vegetables were simply steamed, and I think the green beans were lightly seasoned with butter. There was a piece of cornbread with the meal too. The total was around $9 which wasn't a bad deal for all the food I got.\\nTiny little store selling locally grown produce, meats, with a focus on more organic and healthy foods. I browsed around and found prices comparable to other farmers markets. They also sell some locally made dog treats. They have some unique produce items, like white pomegranate, orange dates, and fresh pistachios from Crooked Sky farms (So fresh they are still in the fleshy fruit covering- fascinating!). While I didn't find anything I needed today, it's a good option for more sustainably grown groceries if you are in the area.\\nI went here the other day with a friend and had the country pad thai.  The noodles were ok, but the chicken and tofu were dry, and it was slightly bland.  I tried a mango smoothie \", 'actual_label': 25, 'predicted_label': 25}, {'text': 'with tapioca too, and while the tapioca \"bubbles\" were pretty good, the mango, while made with real fruit, was also bland because the mangoes themselves weren\\'t very ripe.

The space is where Popcornopolis used to be, near the food court. There are a few varieties of ice cream to choose from such as coffee, chocolate, Thai tea and green tea. I got the #6, a green tea ice cream that was supposed to come with blueberries but they had run out of them for the night so I had to substitute blackberries and raspberries. There was a fairly steady line but the orders came out pretty quickly.\\n\\nThe ice cream was smooth and creamy and I could definitely taste the green tea. I was disappointed that for $7 they only gave me 3 berries to go with the whipped cream on top which was not enough to cover the top of e\\nach single roll. For that price I was expecting more, especially since I can get a better variety and volume of ice cream at other ice cream shops. I guess part of the cost is the novelty of the whole thing along with  the cost of the anti-griddle and labor costs.\\n\\nThe egg waffles were decent. They were light and crispy on top but soft on the bottom. The texture inside the waffle was more dense and chewy than at other places I\\'ve had them, similar to the texture of mochi.\\n\\nI might go here again for the egg waffles but I\\'ll probably go elsewhere for my ice cream fix for that price point.\\nYou don\\'t know what you\\'re missing until it\\'s gone! I\\'m sad that the Tempe Fresh and Easy is out of business, as well as most of the other locations in AZ. This location on Ray is one of the last ones left. Still a favorite for convenient, fresh, easy to prepare groceries and ready to cook foods.\\nOrdered a smoked turkey sandwich to go. The wait was not too bad, and I was on the road in no time.\\n\\nWhen I \\nopened up the wrapping, I have to admit I was underwhelmed with what I saw. It was a very basic looking sandwich for close to $7. The bread, while nice in that it is baked fresh, tasted gummy. They forgot to include onions in the sandwich, which would have helped to break up some of the saltiness of the sandwich from the smoked turkey meat.\\n\\nOverall I wasn\\'t too impressed, but I\\'ll return to see if other items are better.\\nSteve\\'s offers a nice variety of coffee and tea drinks, including seasonal drinks such as pumpkin spice latte. They offer both soy and almond milk as milk alternatives, for $.40 extra. Service was fast and friendly, and the drink I had (Iced pumpkin spice latte with almond milk) was pretty good. I\\'ll definitely frequent Steve\\'s again for their caffeinated drinks and their option to add almond milk instead of soy!\\nSo long Mind Over Batter, hello Jalsa! This unique little sweet shop is kind of like the former store, except kicked up a notch. They have cupcakes and cake \\npops, and an extensive variety of ice cream. About half the flavors are Indian inspired with selections such as mango, cardamom, ginger, and saffron pistachio. The prices were very reasonable for the ice cream and scoops are quite generous. \\n\\nI sampled a few flavors (Saffron pistachio, sapota fruit, ginger) before deciding on the ginger, single scoop. All the samples overall had good flavor but had a grainy texture to them. I enjoyed the spicy kick of ginger flavor and it was a perfect sweetness. My friend asked for a half scoop of black cherry and a half scoop of banana nut and it looked like she got a full scoop each when she got her cup. She said she enjoyed the flavor of the banana nut especially.\\n\\nThe cupcakes and cake pops are beautifully decorated. I\\'ll definitely have to try one next time with another scoop of ice cream.\\n5 stars for the Pompeii special exhibit\\n3 stars for the general admission area\\n\\nI\\'ve been to the Science Center for Adult\\'s Night Out and most recently for the\\n special Pompeii exhibit. Admission is $18 and special exhibits are an extra charge. For the Pompeii exhibit it was around $12 during regular business hours but they do offer an after hours admission for $14 on Thursdays and I think certain Wednesdays. \\n\\nAt our last visit we primarily stuck to the special exhibit. The Pompeii exhibit was a fascinating peek into the lives of the people before Mt. Vesuvius erupted and the aftermath of the explosion. I enjoyed looking at all the various artifacts. It really gave me an idea of what life was like back then. There is a video included in the exhibit that is a recreation of the Vesuvius volcano. Our experience hit a little too close to home as the fire alarm went off just as the video showed the volcano erupting lol. At first I thought \"These special sound effects are really off to be playing a shrill loud buzzing sound for the volcano\" but then the attendant yelled \"FIRE ALARM EVERYBODY OUT AND HEAD TO THE NEAREST EXIT\".\\n\\nI\\'m not sure what tr', 'actual_label': 25, 'predicted_label': 39}, {'text': 'iggered the fire alarm but seeing that the building didn\\'t end up being on fire, engulfed in a volcanic eruption, or other, we were allowed back in after say 10-20 minutes. We finished up our exhibit experience by looking at the ash statues on display which are casts of the originals in Pompeii. You can tell just by looking at the posture of the people and animals forever immortalized in ash how sad and scared they were moments before they died. It was a very sobering end to our experience. \\n\\nThe rest of the general area of the science center seemed fun for kids, although I think the sponsors need to cut back on their blatant advertising. Seriously Chase Bank, do we need a faux ATM at the Science Center for kids to practice withdrawing money from? How is that in any way scientific at a place called a science center?\\n\\nAs for parking, if you use the Science Center parking garage be sure to get your parking ticket validated at the front when you pay for your admission. You\\'ll get discount\\ned parking. The maximum fee will be $8 instead of $12. We paid $3 for our visit with the validated ticket. I think we spent maybe 1-1.5 hours here.\\n\\nWhile I enjoyed the special exhibit, I found the cost to be really expensive. Without a AAA discount ($2 off admission) our total would have been $30 each. I would pay the $12 again to see something similar to the Pompeii exhibit but $18 for the general admission fee in addition to that seems steep to me especially if I\\'m going to have to see tacky endorsements from sponsors disguised as exhibits here which have nothing to do with science.\\nSpa Lamar advertises itself as an everyday spa.  Go in here expecting just that, and you won\\'t be disappointed.  While the amenities are a bit older than other spas, and a bit more basic, if you get a service such as a massage, it includes use of the facilities for the whole day.  We had a couple\\'s massage here, and the massage therapist did a pretty good job with working out the omnipresent knots in my \\nback and shoulders.  It was a good mix of relaxation and therapeutic massage.  At $210 for both of us, it seemed a bit pricey to me, although since it is a spa environment in Scottsdale, higher prices are to be expected.  They also have a harsh cancellation policy that I wish I could get away with at my own business and still stay afloat!  If you cancel within 24 hours of your appointment time, they will charge you the full amount of your service.  To be charged $210 if an emergency or something happened within 24 hours and I couldn\\'t make the appointment made me feel a bit uneasy- good thing it was a normal day for me!\\n\\nWe were excited to try out the facilities, but there are a few things that need to be updated or fixed.  For instance, the steam room was lukewarm and it seemed like the controls were broken.  The steam room itself is very basic, with blue tile, and just steam, no other therapeutic scents.  There is a pool and jacuzzi outside, which we used for a bit.  There were a lot\\n of leaves in the pool, and there was some dirt both in the pool and the jacuzzi accumulating.  They have flotation noodles and pool rafts for you to use to float in the pool with, but the pool rafts were very dirty and caked with sand, even after trying to rinse off all the dirt with water.  The whirlpool itself is a nice hot temperature, but the knob to activate the \"whirlpool\" feature was missing so we sat in hot, calm water rather than whirlpool type water.  Another option that I found missing was a \"cold\" room so that you can alternate between a hot environment and a cold to invigorate the senses.\\n\\nThey have a bar with fresh fruit, iced water, iced tea, coffee, and a nice selection of hot teas to choose from when you are relaxing in the atrium.  \\n\\nIn general, while Spa Lamar is a decent place to get a spa service from, it isn\\'t the most posh.  So far I\\'d say the best experience I\\'ve had in Arizona would be at Joya, but prices here are more reasonable than Joya, so it is true that \\nyou get what you pay for.\\nA well organized Petsmart, with a good selection of items. Compared to the Tempe Marketplace Petsmart, this one had more to choose from (I was looking for some dog sweaters in a certain size). The fact that they were all 50% off was also a plus!\\nKind of expensive for what you get I think.  In Arizona, you can work out on higher quality machines at the Y for half the price.  They do have an extensive list of classes here though, such as pilates, yoga, zumba, and step aerobics.  There are a number of personal trainers too that you can sign up with, which I have heard are good.  In addition, their smoothie bar is quite tasty.  Although the machines are older, they are well maintained, and there is never a long wait (if any) for popular machines.  There are also massage therapists here which offer competitive rates on massages which are available to non club members (for a higher price) as well as regulars.\\n\"I worked in a pet store and people would ask how big I w', 'actual_label': 25, 'predicted_label': 34}, {'text': 'ould get\"\\n--Rodney Dangerfield\\n\\nYou will have quite the opposite of a Rodney Dangerfield experience at this Pet Club. Here, you will get all the respect! The front half of the store is dedicated to cats, dogs, and a small section devoted to small animals and birds. The other half is devoted to livestock/horse supplies, including hay (Prices are at the counter, Bermuda and alfalfa offered when I went). The dog section has more of a focus on food and treats, but they did have other items, such as toys, cleaning supplies, harnesses, leashes, and crates.\\n\\nI came here actually to look for some protective wear for dogs during the summer while walking on hot pavement. Unfortunately they had only one kind of doggie shoes and they were for cold weather but they did have a wide variety of sizes for them for a good price. I ended up browsing through the rest of the store and got some great deals on treats (50% off). They also had good deals on food, both canned and dry. Some brands I remember see\\ning were Blue Buffalo and Arcana. Unfortunately they didn\\'t have the type of dog food I usually buy for my corgi mix but they had a similar brand which looked interesting.\\n\\nService was extremely attentive and I was asked several times if I needed anything. I was even greeted and asked if I needed anything by a gentleman (Maybe the manager?) in the office when I walked by. Everyone here was really friendly. \\n\\nThe store itself makes good use of the space they have. It\\'s not a megamart like Petsmart but they do have a sizable building to house a lot of different items. \\n\\nIf you sign up to be on their list, they\\'ll also send you some discounts and updates to the store. \\n\\nI didn\\'t see any live animals for sale here but I did read that sometimes they do get in little chicks which I\\'d love to see on a future visit. It\\'s one of my dreams to have egg laying chickens for fresh eggs each day! It\\'s probably for the best they didn\\'t have any animals for sale like snakes, you never know what could h\\nappen with them:\\n\\n\"When I was 16... I worked in a pet store.

They currently have a comfy and versatile outdoor/patio double chaise  that can be configured into various seating arrangements- very unique!\\n\\nThe kitchen items are great here. Our wedding registry was from Crate and Barrel, and all of our items have stood the test of time. They also have more seasonal wares. I especially love this season\\'s bunny serving platter. So cute!\\n\\nWe ordered some patio furniture, taking advantage of a special free delivery deal they were running. The day before, the delivery company called to give us the 2 hour window block. The day of the delivery, the driver called us to give us an ETA, which I appreciated. Set up was fast and effortless, and the delivery guys were very friendly and courteous.\\n\\nCorleone\\'s was decent. I shared a regular size Philly cheese steak wit\\' whiz and grilled onions, and had a bite of pepperoni pizza. The sandwich was made fairly quickly and was well seasoned. It was, however, very watery and runny which affected the consistency of the Cheez Whiz. The juices from the meat and the Whiz dripped down like a monsoon downpour as I ate the sandwich. The bread was soft but slightly cold as I bit into it. Fries were decent and crispy.\\n\\nThe pizza was thin crust, with a slight crispiness to the crust. It was also decent.\\n\\nFor me it was alright. It\\'s not really a place I would really go out of my way to visit, but I might stop by here to eat if I\\'m already in this shopping plaza.\\nOh so tasty, with excellent vegetarian and vegan dishes that can taste better than the original meaty versions.  The no harm chicken parm was excellent, with perfectly crisp breaded seasoning, flavorful tomato sauce, vegan cheese that was a very close texture to mozzarella, on a soft fres\\nh bun.  I also tried some of the buffalo wings, which were tangy, spicy, with a nice texture similar to chicken.  I was surprised to discover that the wings are actually made from mushroom, but that explains why it was so good (I love mushrooms).  While I\\'m not exactly a vegetarian, I have friends that are vegetarian and vegan, and I do appreciate good food when I taste it, and will definitely go here again to try more dishes.\\n\\nP.S.  Their vegan ice cream is amazing!  The coffee ice cream with coco puffs is heavenly.\\n4.5/5\\n\\nI\\'ve been here a few times. The first was to update my dog\\'s license. The second was when a friendly little lost cat followed us back to our house and we wanted to scan it for a microchip to locate the owner. The customer service desk operates through the number system. You grab your ticket and wait for your number to be called. There are a couple benches to sit on while you wait. We didn\\'t have too long until we were called up, maybe 15 minutes or so. \\n\\nUnfortunate', 'actual_label': 25, 'predicted_label': 25}, {'text': \"ly the little cat did not have a microchip but Evie the front desk agent we worked with was kind and friendly. I was able to send her a pdf of the flyer we made and she posted it at this facility and forwarded the info for the West location to post. \\n\\nWe weren't considering this option at all but she also mentioned that if we were to relinquish the cat it would be $96. Seems pretty steep to me but I totally understand why they would charge to give up the animal even if you were a Good Samaritan and took it in when it was lost and looking for its owner. I can't imagine how even more overcrowded they'd be if they accepted any animal that came in as an owner surrender for free. You also have to give them a break too for they'll have to cover the cost of feeding and caring for the pet.\\n\\nLuckily, this story has a happy ending for the owner contacted us when she saw one of the flyers we posted in our neighborhood and the little kitty was reunited with his family.\\nCompared to the Pita Jungle \\nin Tempe, the one here seems to have tastier food.  The hummus was decent, the iced tea very refreshing, and falafel pita great tasting and filling.  The mashed potatoes tasted very freshly made.  Our total with 1 appetizer, 1 side dish, 2 falafel sandwiches, and 1 iced tea was $25 including tax.  Not bad considering the amount of food we got and the fact that it's in Scottsdale.\\nExcellent service, with reasonably priced, high quality products for your dog or cat. They had some great deals today, such as 30% off Zuke's dog treats (My dogs love these little bites!) and 20% off dog beds. They sell one of the best dog foods out there (In my opinion at least : ) ), The Honest Kitchen in several varieties with prices comparable to Amazon. Will definitely stop by here again if I need anything else for the pups.\\nA grocery store and Middle Eastern bakery all in one! Shamy (Pronounced Sham-mee) has ridiculously cheap, freshly made flatbreads and pies, as well as freshly made desserts. We ordere\\nd a few flatbread items (Zataar with cheese and Safiha armani) and a spinach pie. \\n\\nThe breads are all made fresh on the spot in their brick oven and only took a few minutes to make. The zataar with cheese had a great balance of the zataar spice with cheese and the flatbread was lightly crisp. The safiha armani was also tasty, with an even layer of well seasoned ground beef with vegetables. I enjoyed the spinach pie as well. It had a generous amount of spinach with a tangy flavor (I think maybe there's some pomegranate in it). The flatbread was $2.99 and the spinach pie was a whopping $.99. :D\\n\\nWe browsed in the grocery section too, which had lots of unique candies, cookies, herbs, condiments, and syrups (Just to name a few). \\n\\nWhat really set this shop apart from others is the very friendly service. When we entered the shop we were immediately greeted and the lovely lady at the counter explained to us the menu in detail and was very open to answering any questions we had about the men\\nu or any items sold at the store. \\n\\nSo for great service, reasonably priced delicious food, and unique items in their store, 5 stars!\\nThe service here is realllllllllly sloooooooooow...  They seem pretty disorganized and inefficient here, maybe due to understaffing at busy times.  Trying to get your $2 egg McMuffin might take you 20-25 minutes of waiting- I know it did for me!\\nDecent sandwiches and friendly service. Kneaders offers sandwiches, soups, and salads, with an impressive array of baked sweets. I stepped in here for lunch and browsed at the menu before deciding on the portabella grille sandwich, and a mint chocolate brownie. \\n\\nThe portabella grille, strangely enough, did not have much portabella in it. Instead it consisted mainly of roasted zucchini and red bell pepper. While the bread was very good, the actual ciabatta bread was so thick compared to the vegetable mixture that with each bite, I could taste mostly bread and little filling. \\n\\nThe mint chocolate brownie was decen\\nt, albeit super sweet. \\n\\nSodas are Coke based and there is a nice selection of iced teas to the side as well.\\n\\nAlthough I wasn't too impressed with the portabella sandwich, I'd definitely like to try other items to see if they are any better!\\nFor quick but good breakfast, Einstein's serves up consistent food. From their coffee to their wide assortment of bagels and bagel sandwiches, I've always received friendly service and my meals are made in a short amount of time. I recently had a cool and refreshing iced vanilla hazelnut soy latte and a green chile bagel with jalapeno salsa cream cheese. The bagel itself was light and airy, with a nice toasted outer crust. The center was a little doughy though. The jalapeno cream cheese was very flavorful and had a great spicy kick to it. \\n\\nThere's also a shaded patio outside and when the weather is nicer, people often bring their dogs for a breakfast outing with their pups.\\nVery cozy little breakfast/brunch/lunch spot in downtown Chandler.

Once you enter, you are greeted warmly by one of the family members.  We had brunch here, and left pleasantly full and satisfied.  \\n\\nThe meals are a very good price for the portions given.  I was especially impressed with the carne asada burrito ($6).  The burrito was gigantic, encompassing the whole plate, with a side of delicious freshly made salsa and some sour cream.  The tortilla was grilled which gave a nice added texture to the meal.  They have a \"choose your own breakfast\" option which I tried ($6.50), which comes with 2 eggs, and then 3 different breakfast selections (such as French toast, pancakes, breakfast meats, different breakfast potatoes).  Everything was prepared fresh, tasted very good, and a nice option I found was that they had sugar-free syrup for\\n those that didn\\'t want regular syrup.  They also have pretty good coffee ($1.75), both hot and iced.  It is smooth and rich, no hint of bitterness.  \\n\\nIf it weren\\'t for yelp I probably would not have even known about Yoli\\'s, but thanks to the wonder that is the internet I now have a good breakfast spot to go to when I want to start my day off right.\\nSpacious shopping area with a variety of stores and restaurants.

This is one of the few shopping areas that doesn\\'t have one of the large department store anchors such as Neiman Marcus, Nordstrom, or Saks.\\nSa Bai On The Fly- Oh My! On this dreary cold day I was in a spicy curry mood, and seeing all the great reviews for this restaurant piqued my interest in wanting to try it out. I ordered an avocado curry ($10) and Thai eggplant ($8). On the phone I was only offered \"mild\" or \\n\"medium\" options of spiciness. Kind of odd, do they really not make things \"hot\" spicy? I went with the medium level and my order would be ready for pick up in 20 minutes.\\n\\nThe order was ready right on time and packaged very well. It smelled amazing in the car, and it was a huge portion of food for each dish. The avocado dish is a jazzed up green curry with the addition of sliced and chunk avocados to the mixture of chicken, basil, and other vegetables. I think it was a good \"medium\" level of spiciness, just enough spice to let you know it was there without the need for a fire hydrant\\'s worth of water afterwards. The Thai eggplant was a hefty portion of pork, eggplant, and other veggies and was more delicate tasting than the bold curry.\\n\\nThe space inside the restaurant is nicely decorated but very tiny. In addition to ordering by phone, you can also order online through their website.\\n\\nOverall, I\\'d definitely be interested in coming here again to try more dishes.\\nIn the words of John M\\nellencamp, \"Hurts so good.\" :) This cool donut shop states they are open 25/8 which is great since I\\'ve always wanted to bend the rules of time and space to indulge in sweet treats. \\n\\nThe shop is fairly large, with a main seating area and a room in the back. When we got here on a Friday evening there was a steady line but it moved quickly. Each donut ranges from $1-3 depending on what type you get, with volume discounts for a half dozen and dozen. Note that the specialty donuts like the maple bacon or the fritter won\\'t count towards the half dozen or dozen donut deal so you would have to order them separately.\\n\\nThe selections here are unique, colorful, and generous on the toppings and fillings. We shared a dozen donuts. Varieties that we got included Bavarian cream, lemon, Jesus, cookie monster, and Nutella.\\n\\nMy favorites of all the donuts we had were the lemon and the Nutella donut. The dough was soft and fluffy, and the topping was perfect. The cake donuts like the Jesus (As in Hey-S\\neuss the Spanish pronunciation, I accidentally ordered it as the Son of God donut lol) were decent but a bit too dense and not soft enough for me. By the way, the Jesus is kind of like a churro or horchata version of a donut, with a creamy glaze and cinnamon sugar topping with caramel drizzle.\\n\\nService was fast and friendly at the register. The women\\'s restroom was out of order when we were here, and while they have a soda fountain there aren\\'t any options for plain water from the fountain.\\n\\nNext time I\\'m here I might want to try their donut milkshakes which have a whole donut on top. They looked amazing!\\n\\nSince there were so many different varieties and I could only eat so much sugar in one sitting that evening I definitely want to come back to try more. This is a place you could overload your stomach on donuts so much that someone may very well ask you, \"Hurts, donut?\" ;)\\nCool concept.

This means that even though you might be a seasoned golfer, you won\\'t necessarily gain points if you don\\'t hit the ball in the exact area where the zones are.

We got here around 9 A.M. when they open, and there was already a line out the door. \\n\\nIn addition to the driving range, there are overhead TVs so you can watch professional golf while playi\\nng golf, an indoor lounge area, and tables where you can snack, imbibe, or have a full meal. The menu itself consists of bar/party type food such as fries, sandwiches, and some wonderfully delightful donut holes that you fill with your choice of 3 different flavors.\\n\\nService here was excellent, provided by our server Ashley. \\n\\nOverall it\\'s a fun place if you\\'re looking for a group activity that provides casual sport, food, and entertainment. Just be sure you know how to swing that golf club without injuring yourself, since I twisted my wrist while swinging and it\\'s still a little sore a few days later!\\nGreat Irish breakfasts, and other Irish foods like boxty, shepherd\\'s pie, and corned beef and cabbage.  I can\\'t vouch for the more Americanized foods, but the boxty dishes and shepherd\\'s pie I\\'ve tried have been delicious, and although I\\'ve never been to Ireland to have an Irish breakfast, it tasted pretty good to me!  They certainly used all the ingredients that one would have in Irish \\nbreakfast, including blood sausage (Which tastes quite good, despite the sanguinary name).\\nAfter leaving sadly disappointed that the butcher shop we went to didn\\'t sell thawed whole chickens, we saw Fresh and Easy on the way back home and stopped in. The aisles were neatly organized and easy to browse. Service was friendly. We found what we needed and were in and out of the the store in no time, ready to make some bbq!\\nDelicious and beautiful Asian-style cakes.  The cake is fresh, soft, and spongy, and the toppings of fresh fruit really liven up the design of the cakes.  I have had slices and a special made to order cake, and everything I have ordered has been superb.\\nPretty good, if you know what to order.  We got a lot of different dishes to try out.  The grilled sampler was ok.  Not spectacular but it did allow us to try a good variety of their cooked dishes.  The fries were crispy and flavorful.  The real standouts here are the sushi items.  The rolls are made with some of the best\\n sushi fish I\\'ve had here, and are packed with high quality ingredients.  They are expensive, but you do get what you pay for.  Service was good, fairly prompt despite us having a large party to tend to.\\n\\nI\\'d like to go here on a Monday night sometime to try \"happy night\" where selected mixed drinks and all small plates are $5.\\nEh, it was alright. The lunch specials come with a huge amount of food- more than enough to warrant a siesta afterwards! I had the red chile burrito lunch ($7.99), which came enchilada-style, with rice and your choice of beans (Refried, charro, black).\\n\\nWe were promptly served chips and our waitress took our drink order quickly once we were seated. The chips were a huge portion and size, served with salsa and refried beans. The red chile was made with large chunks of beef. Although I appreciated that they used whole chunks, they were bordering on the side of being too large to eat with one bite. The whole meal itself wasn\\'t too remarkable, but it had decent flav\\nor and service was good as we made excellent time within our lunch break.\\nSolid choice for a good weekend buffet. The price on the weekends is $11.95, and it includes soda, or one glass of champagne. Weekday prices do not include drinks but are cheaper.\\n\\nThe spread here had a nice variety of meaty and vegetarian dishes. Such entrees included mutter paneer, chicken curry, goat curry, chicken makhani, mushroom curry, an unusual butternut squash curry (Quite tasty! I love butternut squash), aloo palak, dal makhani, tandoori chicken, and chana masala. Fried items included potato pakora and vegetable samosa. There was a diverse salad bar, 2 different types of chaat, and various condiments like mint chutney. Dessert consisted of mango pudding, kheer (rice pudding), and gulab jamun. The gulab jamun was decent, but more hard and dense tasting than others I\\'ve had. \\n\\nIn addition to the soda or champagne, there is a self serve mango lassi station which was quite nice. There is also a crock of to', 'actual_label': 25, 'predicted_label': 25}, {'text': 'mato soup and a cooker filled with rice. Another plus about this restaurant is that they will make fresh, hot off the oven naan for you in a basket. Tasty!\\n\\nService was great and drinks + plates were refilled and taken away as needed.\\n\\nOverall, a good experience, and the food itself was decent. Go for the great deal for what you get, and the variety of dishes.\\nInteresting concept. \\n\\nChino Bandido serves up combinations that allow you to mix and match various flavors, wrappings, and sides in a fast food Asian Fusion fashion.\\n\\nI\\'ve been here a few times, and while the food is consistent, it\\'s consistent in the fast-food Asian/Mexican way, like a step up from Panda Express or Filibertos.\\n\\nI\\'ve ordered a few items, my thoughts as follows:\\n\\nChinese bbq pork: It wasn\\'t the bright red color I\\'m used to seeing in typical Chinese bbq style pork, but the pork was tender, and had decent flavor.\\n\\nJerk fried rice: Has hints of the \"jerk\" spice seasoning mixed with bits of chicken and veggies. Mildl\\ny spicy.\\n\\nHengrenade burrito: This burrito was around $3, which is quite cheap. However, it is tiny! It was basically the size of the palm of my hand. The hengrenade chicken itself had a great kick from the spicy sauce, and had a piquant bold flavor.\\n\\nEmerald chicken: My favorite entree so far, with tender white meat chicken blanketed with a bright green scallion-ginger sauce. It\\'s somewhat reminiscent of Hainanese chicken.\\n\\nPollo Diablo: Deep fried chicken coated with a vinegary sauce with peppers. Although this is touted as a super spicy dish, it was more like a mild-medium level to me.\\n\\nI\\'ve eaten in and takee outee\\'d, and I\\'ve always encountered fast and friendly service. \\n\\nOverall, good for a fast food fusion fix.\\nI have been eating at Rosita\\'s for years, and have generally been pretty satisfied with their meals here.  Portions are good, and even their \"lighter\" size burrito is still big enough to make me full.\\nOne of the last remaining Blockbusters in the area!  We usually watch \\nmovies and TV show episodes on Netflix, but when we run out of options or when we want to watch newer movies we\\'ll go to this Blockbuster.  Service is always fast and friendly here, and the candy aisle is always so tempting.\\nI always pass by this coffee shop on the way to the vet\\'s office but never had the chance to go try it out until today. Coffee Rush offers a plethora of flavored coffee drinks in both regular and sugar free options. I stepped in and was impressed by the size and atmosphere of this place. It\\'s quite nice inside and the outdoor patio is picturesque with a gently flowing fountain and plenty of seating.\\n\\nI had a 16 oz (\"Small\" size) iced caramel nut latte with soy milk. It was made so fast I would have thought the barista was a Jimmy John\\'s employee in a previous life lol. The total was a little more than $4.50 and I was out the door in no time.\\n\\nThe coffee in the latte was smooth and the flavors complemented each other well. It wasn\\'t overly sugary which was much appr\\neciated. I did like it with soy but if they offered drinks with almond milk I\\'d be even happier! \\n\\nDue to the friendly, lightning fast service, lovely atmosphere and good coffee I\\'ll be back to try another drink.\\nOrdering online to this location was extremely easy and convenient since you can prepay for your meal and select the time you want it ready. My Arizona burger was made right on time and packaged very well with the modifications I requested (No onions to avoid stinky onion breath at work). The burger itself tasted like your usual Smashburger with great flavor and heat from the raw jalapeño. Definitely a good place to get lunch!\\nOhh deer! My friend sent me a link about the Arby\\'s limited time venison sandwich promotion which piqued my interest in eating here. It had been forever since I\\'d actually hoofed it over to one so I figured it was time to try them out again! \\n\\nI high-tailed it over here after calling to confirm they still had venison left. I had heard from another Yelper\\n that in some locations they only had 100 sandwiches at their Arby\\'s and I didn\\'t want my experience here to be a McDonald\\'s Szechuan sauce fiasco. \\n\\nI entered the store and glanced at the limited time promotion sign, pointing to it all doe-eyed. \\n\\n\"I\\'ll have two of the venison sandwiches please!\"\\n\\nThe sandwiches themselves were pricey, $8 each. But would they buck the trend of Arby\\'s food infamy? While I waited for my food I pondered this as I grabbed a few packets of horsey (Or deery?) sauce from the stag-gering well-stacked piles of condiment packets. My order was made in a few short minutes and I was on my way home to indulge in a dash of Dasher, Donner and Blitzen! (Prancer, Comet, Cupid, Vixen and Rudolph were unavailable for comment)\\n\\nThe sandwich was nicely packaged in a cardboard box. The bun had a cross shape on top and the slab of venison looked like a decent size. There were a small amount of fried onions in it and the meat was coated in a juniper berry sauce that tasted mo', 'actual_label': 25, 'predicted_label': 25}, {'text': 're like a juniper flavored ketchup. The actual taste of the venison was like a mineral-infused, lean slightly chewy beef. Overall it was OK, for me the meat wasn\\'t very gamey tasting but the meat did have some more stringy pieces that I had to really work on chewing through.\\n\\nIt\\'s not a meal I would fawn over, but I do appreciate that Arby\\'s decided to sell a venison sandwich and I\\'m glad I tried it so in that aspect I find it en-deer-ing! (I hope their next offering isn\\'t Bambi brulée or Deery Lou stew)\\nFairly short hike, but you will get a good work out due to the steep slopes you will hike up!  Once you reach the top, you get some really nice views of the Phoenix area.  Be sure to bring some water if you are hiking here in the summer.  There\\'s not much shade here!  If you do bring your dog here, be sure to bring some doggie bags since there are no stations that dispense them around this area.\\nAh, La Madeleine. I loved to eat at La Madeleine way back when they had a location at the S\\ncottsdale Fashion Square Mall (Eons ago, when dinosaurs roamed the Earth in search of Coelacanth croissants, French onion Oviraptor soup and Brontosaurus brioche ), so I was excited to hear they had opened up a shop in Chandler near the mall. We were in search of an evening sweet treat, so we headed over to get a few items to go. When we entered, we were warmly greeted by one of the workers exclaiming \"Bonjour!\" There\\'s a dine in area and a separate to-go and bakery area which is convenient for those wanting to grab and go. \\n\\nWe perused through the delectable looking pastry case. The sacher torte caught my eye. It\\'s hard to find this little slice of Austrian heaven in Arizona, so I knew I had to get it. I also love citrus-infused desserts as well so we got a lemon tart. It was neatly packaged in a small little box and we were on our way to enjoy some dessert in the comfort of our own home.\\n\\nThe sacher torte was a lovely sight to behold. The ganache layer was perfectly smooth, with a sm\\nall little chocolate \"Sacher\" placard on top. While the end of the torte was a bit dry the rest of the cake was moist and I liked the combination of fruit with the dense chocolate cake. The lemon tart was beautifully made, but the crust was a bit too hard for me with a runny filling that was too sweet for my tastes. \\n\\nI\\'m glad La Madeleine is back in the Phoenix area! Here\\'s hoping it\\'s here to stay.\\nWe went here mainly because of the location and the dog friendly patio.  The patio itself is very nice and has a lot of well shaded areas to keep you cool from the hot sun.  We had breakfast here, which was a mixed experience meal-wise.  I had the Hawaiian French toast ($8.75) which was disappointing to me.  The only thing that seemed to make it Hawaiian was a few slices of banana placed on top of the French toast.  The menu listed a molasses batter for the toast, but I couldn\\'t taste much molasses flavor.  In addition, the toast itself looked overcooked and tasted dry.  For $8.75, I would\\n have liked to see more ingredients than some slices of banana on top of 2 sliced pieces of battered toast (Maybe some pineapple? Or grilled ham?).\\n\\nMy husband had the biscuits and gravy platter (Around $10), which I thought was much better value wise and taste wise.  The gravy was rich and delicious, and it was a large amount of food since it came with bacon, potatoes, and 2 eggs.  I also tried the short rib benedict, which was nicely cooked, with great flavor.  \\n\\nSo while I didn\\'t really enjoy my dish, the others I tried were very good.  I\\'d like to go here again to try more dishes, but be aware of what entrees to get!\\nDid you know acupuncture can be used to help lower blood pressure, relieve chronic pain, and treat insomnia? There are many more benefits and the list is extensive. \\n\\nAfter trying a session at a different acupuncture clinic I decided to continue treatments at Yin Rising due to cost, ability to book online and location. They offer both private and community acupuncture \\nsessions at reasonable rates, and I also appreciated that the bios of each acupuncurist were online. \\n\\nMy first session was with Kathleen who was very detailed and thorough. She has a kind, peaceful sensibility about her and is a wealth of knowledge on natural medicine. She recommended some things I could do outside of the acupuncture clinic which would be easy to implement. \\n\\nI\\'ve seen every acupuncturist on staff since and I\\'ve been happy with each of them, whether it\\'s Danielle\\'s friendly demeanor and clinical thoroughness or Nicole\\'s cheerful, bright personality and gentle touch.\\n\\nI also like how the community acupuncture prices are on a sliding scale with a minimum of $25, on a pay as you are able to basis. There are also package discounts of 3 sessions for $70 and also packages of 5 or 10 sessions for a greater discount.\\n\\nSince I\\'ve started I\\'ve seen some promising results with the treatments so I will continue to see the lovely ladies that practice here. Thanks for a great exper', 'actual_label': 25, 'predicted_label': 25}, {'text': 'ience!\\nI first heard about First Watch through a friend.  \\n\\nMy first reaction: \"First Watch?  Sounds like an insurance company\"\\nMy friend: \"Yeah, I thought it was some sort of weight loss program\"\\nAnother friend who I invited along: \"Oh that place? I thought they sold watches!\"\\n\\nName confusion aside, we came here for brunch on a Sunday.  It was fairly busy, with a 25 minute wait, which wasn\\'t so bad since they have free coffee at the counter for you.  I didn\\'t have any, but my friend said it tasted good.\\n\\nWe got seated and the waitress took our orders.  When it came to my turn to order, I pointed out what I wanted on the menu (eggs benedict florentine) and the waitress repeated what I said.  About five minutes later, another waitress comes by and asks us \"whoever had the skillet, how did you want your eggs?\"  We all look at each other- no one ordered a skillet?  \\n\\nThe waitress said she\\'d get the original waitress to sort it out.  Well... a few minutes after that,  yet another waitress \\ncomes along and sorts out our orders.  Apparently the person taking my order wrote down skillet instead of eggs benedict, even though she repeated what I had ordered, and saw what I had pointed to on the menu.  To be fair, she was new on the job, but in general it seemed like the service was unorganized (after we got all our food yet ANOTHER waitress came by with another order of my friend\\'s food- oops for them)\\n\\nSo.... food is good, service is spotty, and I was slightly grossed out by the bits of stuck on egg that was left on my knife.  It took me 3 times of asking the various waitresses to get a new knife!  I\\'m giving this a marginal 3 stars because of the food alone though since the eggs benedict was in fact very tasty.\\nJoya provides pure relaxation in a serene, Morrocan inspired atmosphere.  With any spa purchase, you are invited to indulge in the spa\\'s whirlpool, sauna, relaxation lounge, outside pool, and steam room.  While the decor itself is lush and exotic, I have to admit tha\\nt I\\'ve been spoiled by the amenities at Qua Spa in Vegas so the steam room and whirlpool, while nice, don\\'t hold a candle to Qua.  \\n\\nThe massage itself was good.  The massage therapist was very attentive and applied the exact amount of pressure I had asked for.  After a day of using the spa and getting a massage, I was feeling pretty good for the rest of the day!\\nIt\\'s been years since I ate at an Outback. I had a coupon so I figured let\\'s try them out again! \\n\\nThey are currently offering a 4 course meal starting at $14.99. The meal includes salad, soup, entree and dessert. It was such a good deal I couldn\\'t pass it up! \\n\\nI chose the Caesar salad, upgraded to the French onion soup ($1 more), had the 6 oz. top sirloin with raspberry cheesecake as dessert. \\n\\nIn general, everything was good. The salad was cool and refreshing, the soup had beefy onion flavor, and the sirloin was cooked nicely at medium rare. At 6 oz the steak is a bit small but the rest of the courses made up for it. I didn\\n\\'t get to the cheesecake but I was able to get a to go container to eat it for later. For the price I paid I was pretty satisfied. \\n\\nService was warm and friendly. I think one of the managers was here tonight too and he was also providing excellent service and even held the door open for us when we left. \\n\\nIf I\\'m in the mood for a steak that won\\'t break the bank this is a good choice.\\n\\n3.5/5\\nPINGing with excitement, we were thrilled to try out some dim sum while in Vegas. We ate here with some friends that had lived in Vegas and said this was one of the best places for dim sum. We arrived here around noon, and there was a bit of a wait, since there is limited space in the restaurant, especially for large parties of more than 4. Ignoring our PANGs of hunger, we waited patiently. It probably took us about 20-30 minutes to get seated. \\n\\nWhile the selection is more limited than other dim sum restaurants, they do you have your standard dim sum items like shu mai, sticky rice in lotus leaf, \\nfried taro cake, chicken feet, spare ribs, congee, and bao. \\n\\nThe items were hot, and fresh tasting. The carts went by at a decent rate, but we were warned that you should get any items you wanted while the cart was there, since you might not see that cart again. Prices were a bit high compared to other restaurants I\\'ve eaten at (3-4 dollars per item average), but that was to be expected for dim sum in a Vegas casino.\\n\\nService was a bit spotty, but to be expected since the restaurant was filled to capacity with hungry diners. Waiters were buzzing back and forth, like a ball in a PONG game, filling water, getting more tea, and getting people\\'s checks.\\n\\nSo if you\\'re hungry for dim sum, this restaurant is a good choice. If you are with a larger party though, it helps to come here before noon when it\\'s less crowded.\\nLadies night!

As someone\\n who lived here for a few years on Lakeshore, there are constant vacancies. I'm not sure what it is about this kipling  to Royal York area/ stretch. Very little works and very little ever lasts. So obviously to have a restaurant with over a hundred Yelp reviews, a steady clientele, much kudos to the owners and staff. I enjoyed the huevos breakfast, the classic smoothie was also good. I think $6.50 for a basic strawberry and banana smoothie is a lot to charge. The strong menu of breakfast and other items is also not a cheap eat. It's definitely one of those restaurants I would visit more often if it were a couple bucks cheaper per meal. The interior is on the smaller size, I pretty much was a part of a incredibly chatty woman's conversation a table away.

After 40 years there is not a lot I consider overly 'unique' about this city.  CN Tower is unique to loo\\nk at (if you haven't seen it before...).  It's main streets; Yonge, Bloor..  not that interesting as a whole.  Kensington is a fun place to walk, eat, people watch and eat again...

Corn soup (sounds so simple...) is exceptional, especially on a cold day, because the soup is scalding and takes at least 10 minutes to become edible from the bowl (i.e. HOT).

Especially in the junction. Symes Road has mostly and only always been and industrial and meatpacking area. Which unfortunately has become quite a blemish on that particular area. The stink is real. It's crazy to think they're building a condo right next to this section. Wait till they get a whiff of the stench.Anyways, there are three breweries in this area.

I guess for a tourist the idea of sitting in a jamppacked, really loud small restaurant that's fun (u can avoid the line by getting pick up/take out; trust me, sitting inside ain't that great!).  The Main moves quickly, also been around a long time.  I hesitate to tell all of this, mostly because selfishly I like that it's quiet.  Maybe just stand in the Schwartz line after all, less headache for me!  Or unselfishly; save yourself time and hassle; try THE MAIN.\\nSurprised this doesn't have better review, lot better than the crammed Royal York location.

More importantly I liked the chicken katsu (spelling?), it's on the smaller side, at almost 10 bucks it's a small portion, price should be 'lower' of serving larger (extra chicken).

Other items like sage and singing bowls are available, along with a random selection of clothing and accessories (wallets, mostly) toward the back.\\n\\nBut as the name implies, Charlie\\'s specialty is jewelry. Several display cases lining the room showcase rings for men and women, from those featuring birthstones to unique engagement ring options. There\\'s also a large selection of necklaces made of polished agate and quartz crystals- and the prices are decent too. I\\'ll have to pop in the nex\\nt time I\\'m in Boulder City.\\nPopped in when the wait at Chile Verde Express was way more than I was willing to wait for a California burrito. Location is small but clean, menu pretty similar to a Robertos but with a few more specials ($3 chicken burrito was on special by the register). Regular prices are on the low side, too.\\n\\nGot the Vegas Burrito- which is what other spots call a California Burrito, with protein, guac, sour cream, cheese, and French fries. Confusingly, they also have a CA burrito listed, but it\\'s with rice instead of fries, which sounds like a standard burrito to me. Food was fine, good size, asada was a bit chewy but flavorful, wasn\\'t asked my meat preference (lengua).\\n\\nThey have a salsa bar in the back with the pickled veggies and three salsas: the thick red was my favorite, followed by the verde, last being the orange. Food came out quick. 35 cent fee for using credit cards.\\nThe Mixx is a mix of several different dining options: part bar with HH specials and live m\\nusic, part sit-down dinner with upscale steak and seafood entrees, and part build-your-own-bowl (and dessert!) setup not unlike a Mongolian grill. All menu prices inexplicably end in .77, for another (unnecessary) added gimmick. The atmosphere and decor are classy but the concept is muddled. \\n\\nHH: Food specials are limited to about five dishes all priced at $4.77(?), which isn\\'t that great of a deal when the dishes are bruschetta, truffle fries, and hummus. Their regular menu is pricey. The bacon wrapped dates and sliders (pair) on HH are decent deals, and the burgers especially were cooked just right so they were nice and juicy! I\\'ll be getting them again.\\nBUILD YOUR OWN: The \"regular\" size portion is huge, like share-it huge. I dined in with a friend and she went to the buffet area to mix up a variety of carbs (noodles!), proteins (including shrimp and lamb), veggies, and sauces. It\\'s one of those things where your food is as good as you make it. As others suggest, it\\'d be great if t\\nhey had some go-to combos listed on the menu to pick from (scampi sauce + shrimp + tomatoes + spinach + mushrooms over your carb of choice, for example). \\nREGULAR MENU: The coconut lemongrass mussels are worth a shot. The creamy broth is amazing, similar to a tom kha soup, but with mussels. Portion looked large but we got a few empty shells and a couple that were tiny and/or dried out, which was somewhat less than appropriate considering the $18 price tag, but that broth was damn delicious. \\nDESSERT: What the hell. Another build-it-yourself thing. They currently have a Yelp check in offer to get your dessert for free ($8 value), so do it. The brown butter tart with vanilla bean ice cream, strawberry preserves, caramel drizzle, and candied hazelnuts was frickin\\' awesome. Again, portions are huge, and even sharing didn\\'t take down this treat. This is actually one of the rare places I\\'d insist on getting dessert when I return.\\n\\nService even at the bar is pretty friendly. This space is hug\\ne and they kind of seem to be doing a little too much under one roof, but the food is tasty enough to come back for. Check social media for discounts (like BOGO drinks) and the occasional Groupon.\\nHeads up that the asada fries here are like crack- horrible for you but oh so good in the moment. They use liquid nacho cheese sauce rather than shredded. Not everyone appreciates this, but I actually prefer it for this dish. The asada is flavorful and despite other reviews, it didn\\'t seem any greasier than asada I\\'ve had elsewhere.\\n\\nThe tacos are fine: lengua, cabeza, and asada with cilantro and onions are all hot and fresh. Corn tortillas aren\\'t too thick or too thin, didn\\'t have much flavor either but didn\\'t fall apart which is  most important.\\n\\nNot sure why there are so many negative reviews- location is in the parking lot of a mexican market, maybe clientele are more discerning? Has been clean with friendly staff whenever I\\'ve gone.\\nThis place doesn\\'t look like much- in fact, even armed ', 'actual_label': 27, 'predicted_label': 27}, {'text': 'with the Yelp app directions, I drove past it. The exterior just says PIZZA & RIBS, instead of the actual business name. That said, now that I\\'ve found it, I\\'m not going to forget. \\n\\nThere\\'s currently a Yelp deal up, $10 for $20 credit. They also have $5 discount codes for ordering online. Either of these can be combined with their super-low lunch special prices. And even the lunch portions are enormous! So far, I\\'ve yet to find anything that isn\\'t tasty.\\n\\nRIB TIPS: The favorite dish so far, an entire takeout box packed full of meaty pieces, and better than many of the crappy barbecue spots here in town. $10\\nPHILLY SANDO: Lunch special is a hefty sandwich packed with meat and grilled veggies, plus a side of fresh fries, for about $8. This easily makes two lunches for me.\\nWINGS & FRIES: Their sauce choices are few but the wings themselves are large and meaty, and even the meal comes with ~12 pieces. Not sure how many come in the bucket or half bucket, but this is a generous portion. Bon\\nus points for offering a Cajun flavor that is actually a sauce instead of a dry rub!\\n\\nService is friendly and fast. Location is a small and messy takeout counter with no seating available. Majority of their business is delivery.\\nI\\'m convinced this place is the only thing that makes Fashion Show Mall even remotely bearable. Make this your first or last stop if you need the self-reward system to deal with the large crowds and/or rampant consumerism. \\n\\nThe reviews are right though, the honey almond latte is the way to go- soy milk for me. The mexican mocha is also a solid option. Both are available hot or iced, and served in a surprisingly fast and friendly way for what is otherwise just a small counter you might overlook. Bonus points for having so much seating available nearby, but it\\'s essentially another Coffee Bean or Starbucks with a different name.\\n\\nTIP: Get here easiest by parking in the garage under Nordstrom\\'s, going up to the first level (mostly menswear) and heading out toward\\n the main mall.\\nDragged the BF here for a quick late lunch- we\\'ve been to a few \"gourmet hotdog\" places, and they\\'ve been pretty hit or miss for us. But I had a feeling about this place, and when it was featured as Yelp LV\\'s review of the day last week, I knew I had to go soon.\\n\\nWe arrived for a late lunch around 3PM. Two guys working- an owner-looking fella and a young cook. Stood at the counter for a good five minutes being ignored as they filled orders and walked them to tables without acknowledging me. BF eventually stood in line for me, asked to place an order, and was apologized to a few times about the delay. Guess customer service isn\\'t quite the strong suit here.\\n\\nIn their defense, even for a late lunch, the crowd was steady- we ordered the bulgogi beef and the bahn mi dogs, plus an order of the chili cheese fries. I loved the bulgogi dog- piled high with beef and green onions, it was tasty without being overwhelming. BF preferred the bahn mi, which had a good assortment of cr\\nunchy veggies and pork belly, with srircha mayo that had a good kick to it. We really could have done without the chili cheese fries, and they were underwhelming- the fries were unsalted and the chili was very basic, we should have stopped at the dogs or tried the Euro Special instead.\\n\\nWas impressed enough with the dogs we had to come back- BF is already making a list of what he wants to try on his next visit. But we\\'re more likely to split 3 dogs than do 2 plus a side of fries next time. One dog is easily a meal for a girl or guys who don\\'t have huge appetites, so don\\'t go overboard ordering. Decent prices, too: think everything is about six dollars each, from the dogs and burgers to pimped-out fries.\\nHoly yucca fries, yall. New Granada has opened in the hoppin\\' CSN food court building with a menu of Colombian favorites from fusion burgers and hot dogs to empanadas and peeled corn. Plus that yucca. \\n\\nOrdered via Yelp, got the Italian dog (sausage, mozz, bacon, crushed potato chips, s\\nauces), the yucca (insert heart eyes emoji here), and empanadas- they didn\\'t offer an option for what kind, but I got chicken and potato. The dog was okay, huge portion but flavors didn\\'t really harmonize. Empanada was good but wish I had filling options. Okay so about that yucca- huge portion, perfectly fried, and served with this amazing salty, cheesy sauce that I could not get enough of. Whatever you get, add on the yucca, trust me.\\n\\nService was polite, online ordering is convenient, bonus points for vegan options.\\nWhen a business specializes in one single item, they better be damn good at it.  Luckily, the Corndog Company actually makes really good corndogs, available in half and quarter pound sizes. They recommend getting this with a honey drizzle, which I\\'ve never heard of but actually offsets the saltiness of the dog nicely without adding to the heaviness of the fried outer shell. Add mustard for some extra contrast.

Looking forward to seeing them at another community event soon!\\nYou won't hear me use this word often, but this is a sexy gelato shop! Dark wood, cushy couches and rose-gold accents, plus friendly staff. Not to mention the overflowing heaps of sweet and savory gelato flavors! This place is filling the void for me since Desyree and Art of Flavors parted ways.\\n\\nThey feature 5 new flavors per week, posted by the menu. Elvis, The Fat Years (peanut butter gelato with fried brioche and banana jam) was better than expected, their famed Pear & Rhubarb was sweet and fresh, but my heart was stolen by the Poached Figs in Marsala! I can't even describe it, but it's a must-try. BF was hooked by a peanut butter-chocolate flavor and the coconut-lychee.\\n\\nHighly recommend grabbing and sharing a two-scoop cup, low $5 price. Snag a meal before (or after) at Ribs & Burgers, another Australian company, and make it a party.\\nTypical casino bar in the middle of\\n the floor. This one has a super cool 3D ceiling that keeps things a little interesting though. It's the first bar you encounter here, visible from the entry, and frequently gets crowded. There aren't too many seats around the perimeter but they recently added a small lounge area with additional comfortable and stylish seating.\\n\\nPersonally, for about the same price, I'd rather venture further into the casino to Monkey Bar and get some ambiance and live jazz with my alcohol.\\nPROS: \\n+ Northsiders have long been awaiting their own LVAC, and this location is super clean with all new equipment. \\n+ Layout is similar to other locations, so it's easy to find what you need.\\n+ Indoor squash/racquetball/whatever-you-play-with-a-racket space! \\n+ The women's locker room has the bathroom stalls in the back on the way to the showers, completely separate from the changing area and lockers.\\n+ The water fountains have motion-activated bottle filling stations! Please bring this to ALL LVAC locations!\\n \\nC\\nONS:\\n- Women's gym seems to be an afterthought. Cardio equipment has built in screens, but none of them work. This is a simple fix. In the mean time, the wall-mount screens don't even have captions on. Also, there is very poor air circulation in this area. Why have this area if you're going to make it completely unappealing?\\n- Parking lot was full and the gym seemed decently busy, but their class schedule is pretty dismal with limited offerings and time slots.\\n- I have mixed feelings about having a Yogurtland inside of a gym. Like I need any temptation to eat back the calories I burned. Froyo is only minimally healthier than ice cream, and that's only if you eat it plain. I'm not sure this is aligned with the interests of LVAC's core members.\\nDrai's was my first Vegas nightclub experience and I don't have anything bad to say. Though the location itself was smaller than expected, I've since learned that it's larger than other options. Check their social media for special events, guests,\\n theme nights, or promotions. The production effects made for a fun night, as did table/bottle service. The dance floor is fairly large and the dress code only seems to be loosely enforced, but I enjoyed the music, dancers, and lighting effects. Gather up your girl friends and contact a promoter for the best experience!\\nI've quickly grown fond of this little place!  They offer a variety of bento boxes and combo plates that are perfect for someone like me, who likes to try a little bit of this and that throughout their meal. They also have a small sushi menu and some salads, perfect for grubbing after the gym.\\n\\nThe chicken katsu and kalbi plates are a hit with both me and my guy- portions are generous, and I like subbing their mac salad for the rice since it's not as creamy as other spots and has a nice peppery flavor to it. The bento boxes are my favorite to grab and go, making a small feast for only about $10. \\n\\nService is polite and food comes out fast. They have the door bell style \\nbuttons to summon the waitstaff to your table, which I don't typically like, but they're usually attentive enough that I don't have to use it. Location is small but clean and nicely decorated, they usually get pretty busy for lunch!\\nI drove past this diner when visiting Pop's last week, and somehow it stuck in my mind enough to suggest it for breakfast this morning. Pulled it up on Yelp and looked through the recommended dishes, then headed out at 7AM, right when they opened.\\n\\nBF and I sat at the bar and were helped by a sweet older lady. We sat right next to an amazing-looking butter pecan cake, but chose not to try it this visit. I'm slightly regretting it now, since it looked and sounded amazing, but I can't do sugar that early in the morning.\\n\\nBar was set with plenty of local papers to browse through, which we did after placing our orders: the chili cheese omelet with a side of homefries (as per so many recommendations here on Yelp!) and the lunch special of the day (available even\", 'actual_label': 27, 'predicted_label': 27}, {'text': \" at bfast hours!) of tuna sandwich and chicken noodle soup. \\n\\nService was friendly and attentive without overbearing, which is a careful balance when sitting at the bar anywhere, and food was out quick. Omelet was oozing with melted American cheese, and the homefries were on the plain side but had a good crispiness to them- the side mixed well with the omelet and chili sauce.\\nThe tuna sandwich was very basic but nothing to complain about; the soup was downright delicious with noodles that tasted homemade and a broth that was complex and seemed to have been cooked down for a long time.\\n\\nAll the food had a good homecooked taste to it, and it was a nice laid-back morning with my guy and the paper. What more can I ask for that early on a Sunday?\\nThe best way I can describe Prince is by calling it a dive bar with greasy Ukranian/Serbian food, except in a good way. The décor and atmosphere are nonexistent but the staff are friendly and the food is good. They have a full bar and indoor smokin\\ng- patio seating available if you're not a fan.\\n\\nMajority of the clientele here are from Europe, so don't get offended when you're asked where you're from- it's not meant in a rude way. But don't be a stereotypical boring American diner and get the shish kabob, ask for a recommendation or pick something from the specialty entrees section and prepare to be impressed.\\n\\nI opted for the Makedonska Pljeskavica, which is a gyro-like meat stuffed with mozzarella, ham, mushrooms, and cream cheese, between two slices of soft, oily bread. Definitely split this order, as it's a giant portion AND unhealthy. Add a shopska salad to lighten things up- cucumber, pepper, tomato, and feta with a vinegar-oil dressing.\\nVisited this location on a recent day in BC, after visiting the Charleston location a few times- this one is bigger, with wider selection and friendlier staff. Variety of candles, soaps, and trinkets for gifting, along with the Annie Sloan chalkboard paint and instructional classes availabl\\ne on site.\\n\\nWhat I really loved about this location was the staff: lady I worked with was super friendly, and gave me a heads up about new location opening up in Henderson next week! I find their products pricey, and I don't personally use chalkboard paint, so I only really use this store for gifting purposes.\\nBy far my favorite antique store in Boulder City- and probably the largest, too. Lots of variety, carefully curated into distinct sections and styles. Plenty of stuff to search through, but their jewelry is awesome!\\n\\nVintage earring selection is on point, necklaces and earring sets are not even necessarily antique but retro-style and great prices: $10 for a pair of earrings that can totally make an outfit; $13-18 for a necklace-earring set that will elevate a simple black dress to A-List status.\\n\\nLots of various collectibles here, but my favorite section is their Scrabble area: tiles divided into consonants and vowels, along with game boards and the trays, to customize into craft\\ns however your heart desires! Anyone who loves Scrabble as much as I do automatically gets mad respect.\\n\\nStaff is busy but friendly, love that they don't follow people through the store or endlessly try to make pointless chitchat- sometimes I just want to browse without being bothered!\\nYou wouldn't know it from the outside, but inside a regular old business park is this gorgeous dance studio! Beautiful flooring, built-in barre, walls of mirrors, and even some natural light all create a wonderful space for practicing your choreography or taking classes.\\n\\nI initially came in for a PiYo and Vino event (so fun!), and despite the trek across town, really loved the space and the energy I found here. They offer a variety of classes (ballet, tap, jazz, hiphop, ballroom, ShBam, PiYo, etc), along with private lessons and choreography, and their staff are professionally experienced dancers and teachers from Cirque, Broadway, and classical training backgrounds. \\n\\nPricing is reasonable for the leve\\nl of staff qualifications, and the fact that classes are small and allow for individualized attention. Their unlimited monthly membership is the best deal, but drop in classes range from $12-15, which isn't too bad. Rawlins, Kristen, and Shanta are among their great instructors.\\nI made the mistake of coming here before looking up the Yelp reviews, and somehow expected Hawaiian food rather than (mostly) Korean and (some) Chinese with island influence. The bare-bones dining room was also a bit surprising to me, but the food is solid.\\n\\nCOMBO PLATE: This three-meat treat will set you back about $16 but is easily enough food for two. The kalbi was my favorite, while BF preferred the meat jun. Sides of mac salad and rice are plentiful, and you also get the banchan (mostly spicy/pickled items this visit).\\nMANDU: Pot stickers, available in half (4 piece) and full (8 piece) orders, either pan-fried, deep-fried, or steamed. The fried versions were soggy but the dipping sauce is tasty.\\nSPAM MUSUB\", 'actual_label': 27, 'predicted_label': 27}, {'text': 'I: I love this dish, but not here. Entirely too much rice, and such minimal sauce as to render it nonexistent. It\\'s sad when L&L makes a better version.\\n\\nService was attentive and pleasant. Menu has a lot of options, but you can easily get a filling meal under $10/pp here. All the Korean customers around us were only eating jja jjang myun (black bean noodles) so maybe that\\'s the best dish to get here. I\\'ll have to try next time.\\nGreat spot for a picnic, or entertain young kids- if they\\'re still into this sort of thing. I remember going to watch planes land and take off in a similar lot during my own childhood. It\\'s not the most fun you can have without taking your clothes off, but it\\'s somewhat educational. Use your phone to answer your kids\\' questions about lift and drag and crash rates, and tune your radio to hear the control tower messages.\\nAll the DIY quick-fire pizza spots tend to blend together for me, but I\\'ve had positive experiences at this Blaze. They\\'re located in the same p\\nlaza as Sprouts, so after double ad Wednesdays I\\'m too drained to actually cook the groceries I just bought so I often pop in here. I\\'m only half kidding.\\n\\nYou can get a plain cheese pizza, one topping, 2 toppings, or DIY (~$8) with everything you want. Multiple crust options and GF/vegan available, along with side salads and desserts. The original crust here is comparable to the regular one at Pizza Rev, but the toppings are applied a bit lighter here. I do like how they have add-ons like arugula or various drizzles (pesto, buffalo, ranch) after your pie gets out of the oven. Portion is more than enough for one meal and service along the line is friendly, shout out to Sukari!\\n\\nTIP: Download the app for discounts and freebies. In a month, I\\'ve already gotten three offers (bogo, free drink, free dessert).\\nThis place is awesome- all of the fun of the outdoors, without the inconvenience of actually going outside! The entry from the casino floor opens with a waterfall featuring koi, turtle\\ns, and a large shark-looking fish, with stuffed deer and javelinas along the walls and even some coyotes painted above the top. It\\'s great.\\n\\nVenture in further, and you\\'ll find shooting video games, more mounted game and labeled game heads than you\\'ve ever seen outside of a museum, an upstairs shooting and archery gallery, an escalator flanked by a family of bears, another large aquarium, and a virtual forest of fishing poles.\\n\\nOh, and they have merchandise. Fun, giftable stuff like pepper sauces and gun-shaped coffee mugs, along with camo-print home décor and camping food. Their clothing is actually surprisingly affordable, with good sales. Gifted my guy a complete outfit for $25- and I\\'d come back and do it again.\\nGrab your girlfriends and head to Kyou for a spa-style pampering session! Parking is hard to find in this super-busy Chinatown plaza, so make a day of it with mani-pedis in the morning, grab a meal a few steps away, and finish up with another service like a massage, facial,\\n waxing, or lashes and a drink at the tiki bar to show off your new look! The only thing they don\\'t do in this huge, gorgeous space is hair. \\n\\nNail services are competitively priced with Asian nail art available. They\\'re still in grand opening mode, so check for discounts on their social media accounts. My mani-pedi from Melissa was a relaxing experience, and her attention to detail was top notch. Bonus points for having hot tea available to up the relaxation during the foot soak. I don\\'t usually take time for myself for beauty treatments, but Kyou is the spot I\\'ll think of - my next visit will be for a deep tissue massage!\\nUnderwhelmed by the carne asada burrito- the limpest, saddest, messiest burrito I\\'ve had in a while. Menu description includes \"meat, cheese, beans, and sour cream\"- I only detected meat and an insane portion of beans. If your pinto beans are mostly liquid, they have no business being the main component of a burrito.\\nAsada was either flavorless or simply overpowered\\n by the beans- I will say that it had good texture though. Burrito overall was a disappointment. May return for some basic tacos but overall I was just really underwhelmed. Orange salsa is legit though.\\nOne of the lesser antiques stores in Boulder City- they can thank the Coffee Cup café next door for at least 90% of their business. Displays outside are fun to browse, but most of the stuff inside is overpriced, as others have mentioned.\\n\\nWalked in to hear the owner ranting to another customer about tourists, and how so many people go in without buying. Found that to be a distinct turn off, so I saw myself the door. With so many other antiques places in town that are better styled, with more selection, and great service, there\\'s no need to go here. Walk across the street to the Antiques Depot instead, if you\\'re waiting for a table next door.\\nI did not find the prices \"delusional\", as the other review by JR states. I was happy to find this thrift store cleaner and more organized than mos', 'actual_label': 27, 'predicted_label': 27}, {'text': 't others in the city. I also found it noteworthy that they do not have junk here! Modest selection of clothing (including a high-end/designer section), some housewares and décor (including framed art), with a rather large kids selection. Service was polite, several items were like-new with tags or original packaging.\\nWhat is up with hair stylists, nail techs, and massage therapists constantly moving around in this town?! As soon as I find one I like, they move and I have to follow them to a new salon. Luckily, Adrianna Hernandez\\'s hair skills are totally worth any drive.\\n\\nEnter MSS and find a small lobby- a screen shows who is available for walk in services and which stylists are in which rooms. Use the touchpad to buzz in and make your way to their assigned room. It reminded me of a dorm of beauty services- lashes, nails, and various hair services all available under one roof from different staff. Building is nicely decorated, rooms are clean. Metal and glass partitions separate servi\\nce areas and keep the space from feeling closed in. I like the concept!\\n\\nAdrianna is amazing with hair- color, cut, and style were all awesome.  Her work is on IG @adrixhairz and I highly recommend booking in advance. Appointment went quick because she\\'s so easy to talk to, and I left looking and feeling a million times better- isn\\'t that why we come to places like this in the first place?! I can\\'t recommend her enough.\\nZero Degrees has opened up in Vegas right before we hit our sizzling summer season- perfect timing! I came in for their soft opening and then again during grand opening weekend BOGO specials. They\\'ve been promoting their opening all over social media so it has been predictably busy.\\n\\nDRINKS:\\nThe Spicy Watermelon is my favorite so far, less sweet than their much-hyped Mangonada, both available with add-on mango twist and tamarind straw. They also do milk teas (like sea salt green tea) and fusion drinks (like their strawberry horchata) in a few different variations, with \\nregular boba and crystal boba available as add-ons. I also really liked their Ube Shake, which isn\\'t especially sweet but still definitely a dessert and decorated to look like a unicorn with a toasted marshmallow and candy belt. Their major marketing hack is that their drinks are so photogenic, they barely have to promote themselves because social media does it for \\'em. I was pleased to find the drinks were tasty as well!\\n\\nFOOD: \\nLike most tea shops, there are a few snacks on the menu here, from the classic popcorn chicken and fries to a few different dishes of elote and chicharrones. The chicken was better quality than what I\\'m used to at this sort of spot (opt for the bbq flavor). I also tried the hot Cheetos elote, and despite not being much of a fan of hot Cheetos, this crispy, flavor-packed version was addictive and I ate way more than I planned. \\n\\nThere\\'s a special place in hell reserved for those leaving a new business 1-star reviews for typical opening kinks. Service was polite\\n but given that they were busy for opening weekend (expected), orders were a bit slow to come out but wait times were not unreasonable. Things will likely get quicker as the staff get more familiar and the hype dies down a bit. I\\'ll be back to get my sip on this summer!\\nGlad to have another crawfish boil spot in town! Location is in an awkward corner of a plaza, but interior is nicely decorated with a seaside theme- I like their entryway, and their lobster-claw-catch game. Plus they have beer and sake, as well as a few TVs to watch a game while you\\'re there.\\n\\nWe had a pound each of shrimp and crawfish, with potatoes, sausage, and corn, in their Smokin\\' Sauce (a combination of all of their seasonings), at medium heat. Their heat scale is a bit more relaxed than other places, but the flavors were good. Crawfish and shrimp were nicely sized, but I really liked their fried softshell crab basket the most- perfectly cooked, nicely crisp and seasoned crab, over a generous bed of Cajun fries, \\nfor $12. Huge dinner for two, total with tax under $50.\\n\\nTIP: they offer 10% off during their grand opening with Yelp check in- but only Mon-Wed, between noon and 4PM, so pop in for a weekday lunch if you want to save a few bucks, but their pricing is fair compared to other spots in town.\\nCanters is just a few minutes from my work and has been on my radar since they opened, but I\\'ve held off on visiting til they worked out the kinks cited in most of the initial reviews, slow service and high prices. It appears that they\\'ve tweaked the menu and most prices are now fairly reasonable, and a group meal here went well but service still seems to be an issue despite ample staffing.\\n\\nSANDWICHES: \\nFor the classic options, expect about $9 for a half, $17 for a full, stacked like Pamela Anderson. I recommend the Rachel, on rye. But I came for the Franklyn (now named \"The Best Damn Egg Sandwich\"), with steamed brisket, grilled & raw onions, melted cheese, and an egg, on an Everything bagel, plus a', 'actual_label': 27, 'predicted_label': 27}, {'text': \" side, originally ~$14 now down to a reasonable $10. Sando was huge, filling, and delicious, with fresh-popped yolk drizzled into the melty cheese and plentiful, tender beef. Couldn't finish the top half of the bagel, or the side of fruit, sandwich was huge, would get again.\\n\\nNOT SANDWICHES:\\nOther reviews say that their famous pickles are served free upon seating but that wasn't our experience, ordered a half sour plate and they were solid with a mix of pickles and tomatoes. The surprise hit dish was the house-made chips with pastrami, blue cheese, and honey, for a flavor bomb of crispy-chewy, salty-sweet, shareable and reasonably priced at $8. Most orders come with a side of coleslaw, potato salad, or mac salad- the last one was the best choice. Looking forward to coming back for the latkes. Tempted by their Smoked Fish Planks, but disappointed to see they're served on regular plates and not the classic wooden planks as advertised. \\n\\nBAKERY: \\nUse your Yelp check in for a free black & \\nwhite the size of your face! They're huge and comparable to that other deli up the street. Everything in the bakery case is comically huge, like softball-sized cupcakes. Planning to return for their bagel chips, which were bagged on display throughout the dining room. Did not see rainbow cookies on either visit. \\n\\nSERVICE:\\nFor our initial group visit, service was friendly but odd. I expected a wait on Sunday morning but they were empty, yet the hostess stand was unmanned and it took a while to be seated. Our server was polite and friendly but somewhat slow and inattentive (didn't offer takeout boxes, did not split bill, didn't check on us after food was served, didn't get water refills, etc). Used counter to get their bagel and coffee combo on my way into work and staff did not seem used to taking orders?\\nNew management has totally upgraded this little local bakery! Two sisters run this shop, with one in the front of house and one in the kitchen. The partnership works excellently, with\\n tasty food served with attentive and genuinely caring service. The dining room itself is clean, bright, and nicely decorated, with art on display and available for sale. I've been in twice and am already on a first-name basis with Kristin!\\n\\nThe bakery case is always full of beautiful desserts, but I tend to come here for lunch. The ham and cheese croissant is a good classic, and you can add an egg to make it even more indulgent. Their Korean fusion dishes with bulgogi come especially recommended and the burger I ordered had so much flavor! Their coffee drinks are super strong and well balanced, made with Lavazza. It's hard not to pop in every time I go grocery shopping in this plaza.\\nSmall town with several antique stores, hiking, and some good food, all a short half-hour drive from Vegas: what's not to love? \\n\\nPlan a whole weekend here: spend a day hiking, get your eat and drink on at Milo's, then listen to some live music and brews at Jack's Place. Stay at a local place, and wake up\\n or the pork chili verde at Coffee Cup, browse the antique stores, grab a Dole Whip before heading to the park to see the Big Horn Sheep, and then grab a burger at Dillinger's before you head back home!\\n\\nLocals are friendly, stores have diverse product you won't find elsewhere, and the food is actually pretty good- small town weekend fun, family-friendly or not. Totally up to you!\\nA food court counter serving up smothered pork chops that can compete with Southern-style stars M&M Soul Food? Yes! The chops are fall-off-the-bone tender with a savory gravy that takes you back to Mississippi in a single bite.\\n\\nMenu has smothered and fried options, with sides including cabbage, collard greens, mac and cheese, and beans, with several dessert options including german chocolate and sweet potato. You don't go here to stick to a diet, you come to get a comforting meal that feels like a hug from the inside.\\n\\nSmothered chops plate ($12.50) is a huge portion with two sides, the collard greens are te\\nnder and tasty, while the mac is legitimately the cheesiest, cheddary-est ever. Like it was cheese overload, and I love cheese. Cornbread was straight-up Jiffy mix, which made me think of home but I'd prefer a better version.\\n\\nService is quick, prices are affordable, portions are huge, and quality is good enough for a stand alone restaurant. Looking forward to their inevitable relocation and expansion!\\nI made an appointment here since this location has been my go-to mechanic for a couple of years now. Didn't realize til later that it's under new ownership and staff. Jim was helpful with my calls and drop off, and touched base with me by phone about the work over the course of the day.\\n\\nWe had a bit of a miscommunication about what was to be done but ultimately resolved it amicably. Jim even had some suggestions for additional work I could get done more affordably, if he had time to order a part online instead of through a dealership. I left intending to use his services when my work sc\", 'actual_label': 27, 'predicted_label': 27}, {'text': 'hedule allowed me to drop off my vehicle again.\\n\\nOne of the things they did was top off my coolant. The next day, driving down Desert Inn, my car started smoking. I pulled over and realized it\\'s steam, and the cap to the coolant reservoir  popped off. I was able to locate the cap under the hood, bought and refilled with more fluid, and carried on, but not after flipping out. I left Jim a panicked voicemail and he touched base with me the next day with apologies. \\n\\nI am now on the fence about returning for more service. Jim seems like a nice guy trying to do right by returning customers to a new business he\\'s taking over, and he is helpful, but correctly replacing a radiator cap is small potatoes. Mistakes happen, but I don\\'t feel fully comfortable doing more extensive work here at this time.\\nJewel\\'s was one of the highlights of my most recent trip to Phoenix. One of my coworkers raves about this bakery and special orders their gluten-free bread loaves several times a year and has them \\nshipped. They\\'re that consistently good!\\n\\nBesides the special-order and bakery options (with a case full of GF, vegan, non-dairy, nut-free, etc cupcakes and cookies), they also operate a breakfast/lunch cafe- the whole menu is available the whole day, which allowed us to each eat our favorite foods.\\n\\nThe GF Chicken and Waffles is one of the best versions I\\'ve tried, GF or otherwise. That Sriracha honey is bomb! The AZ omelet is packed with veggies and served with roasted potatoes, surprisingly filling. I also really enjoyed the Grilled Veggie Shawarma bowl, but wish there were a soy tzatziki/cheese option to make it fully vegan.\\n\\nService was super sweet, our special order was ready when we arrived, and they offer a free cookie with Yelp check-in! The vegan snickerdoodle was soft, chewy, and just the right amount of sweet. Wish we had a Jewel\\'s in Vegas, love how well they accommodate specialized diets while still serving up flavorful food at reasonable prices.\\nForget about $5 footlongs\\n, it\\'s all about $5 smoothies on Tuesdays! Bodi Café, a small spot inside the City Athletic Club, sells a list of about 10 smoothies in small (20oz) and large (32oz) sizes for a flat $5 every single Tuesday. It\\'s a steal. \\n\\nFirst drink here to try them out was the banana-nut. I added cinnamon at the suggestion of the employee (yum!) and espresso beans ($1 extra). The 32oz is massive and was more than enough for both my pre- and post-workout beverage. \\n\\nBonus points for having a sheet of nutritional info available with the stats on each smoothie, including calorie counts for each size. I\\'ll be making this spot my regular Tuesday stop before hitting the nearby LVAC!\\n\\nEDIT: Hawaiian Harvest is another tasty shake, but my new favorite is the Chocolate Thinny Mint with Burn Fat Burn and chocolate protein powder.\\nDon\\'t be fooled by the name, this isn\\'t a sausage-based restaurant but more of a Eastern European grocery with a large deli stocked with plenty of sausage. Deli area also has ready-\\nmade items like fresh pickles, salads, schnitzel, and stuffed cabbage rolls. \\n\\nPricing is pretty fair and the selection of meats and cheeses is good, but I\\'m hoping they add more items as the settle in. I would specifically like to see olivier salad and a selection of breads- as it is, I need to stop next door at TJ\\'s if I want to make a sandwich with the deli goods purchased here. Staff is friendly and happy to offer samples- ask for the salmon!\\nThis teacher loves recess... AKA, Happy Hour at PS702! I dig the school theme, which carries throughout the restaurant décor (math flashcards clipped up around the bar) and menu (shareable portions are in a section called \"study group\"). They\\'re a theme restaurant without being tacky about it.\\n\\nFARRO & BRUSSELS SPROUTS SALAD: surprisingly filling, this could be a late lunch. The sweet curry vinaigrette is interesting and there are a lot of contrasting textures.\\nCRISPY CAULIFLOWER: The breading is super-thin and slightly spicy, with buffalo and\\n bleu dipping sauces, served in a mini cast iron skillet. One of the better versions I\\'ve had, not greasy!\\nPARM-TRUFFLE FRITES: You know you want them. They smell great, but let\\'s get real, everyone has fancy fries these days, right? These come with a spicy ketchup and lemon aioli. Get \\'em.\\nSPECK & EGGS: Another dish everyone has, with the PS touch adding crispy prosciutto and a kick of spice.  Nicely creamy filling.\\nCRISPY AHI TUNA TACOS: You can\\'t go wrong with ahi. Tiny wonton shells filled with avocado and ahi, lightly dressed in ponzu. One of the lighter options, pairs well with the salad above.\\nPB&J SLIDERS: The dish I was most excited about and the only one I was underwhelmed by. Menu only states \"blackberry habanero jam with smoked bacon\" and for some reason my eyes interpreted the word \"slider\" as a mini sandwich, most likely heated, on a thick challa-style bread. It\\'s actually 3 typical sliders (mini patty and bun) with the two condiments gracelessly smeared on. With less PB ', 'actual_label': 27, 'predicted_label': 27}, {'text': 'and more J, this might have been palatable but dry beef + sticky PB = Nope.\\n\\nAll of this, with a beer and tip, for ~$40 can easily feed three. Service was awesome when it was around, bar staff were constantly busy to the point of being overwhelmed. Our server apparently went home altogether, and after nearly half an hour of waiting around to close our tab, Kourtnie kindly took care of us. \\n\\nNot sure I\\'d come back outside of recess hours, but it\\'s definitely fun. The food is approachable with some innovative twists rather than the standard safe staples I expected.\\n168 is my usual Asian market of choice but I decided to try this one for a change of pace- produce section is a lot smaller but this place has sushi-grade fish available in salad-bowl type packs, which I haven\\'t seen elsewhere.\\n\\nIn addition to produce, there\\'s the mandatory giant row of various pastas and multiple rows of condiments, along with an insane amount of udon. I liked the ready-made section, with seaweed salad, fried\\n vermicelli, wings, pancakes, and even sushi rolls. (Side note: there\\'s a sushi stand in the food court making it fresh for less.)*\\n\\nMinor irritation at the fact that the soba noodles and the soba noodle sauce are nowhere near one another- in fact, the soba noodle sauce is on a random shelf above the frozen gyoza. Too bad I didn\\'t find it until after I looked through every other aisle with bottles for 20 minutes.\\n\\nAnd then I was kicking myself to realize I could have asked the cashier, who speaks perfect, fluent English- I think he was actually Hispanic. Guess I need to check my assumptions at the door!\\n\\n*Without the attached food court, I\\'d have no reason to come here over 168. We\\'ll see which becomes my preferred stop over time.\\nNot a fan. Went in to grab some snacks for the drive home to Vegas, hoping to grab a bunch of local breads, cheeses, and other little things but the store is tiny and selection is dismal. Produce area barely had anything in it, half of store seemed to be supp\\nlements and beauty products. I would have rather gone to Sprouts and spent less for better selection. The locally made tamales looked like a good deal, would have preferred they not be frozen. I do like that there\\'s a coffee shop counter in the back, but no one seemed to be keeping an eye on the area so I got a drink elsewhere.\\nI have a love/hate relationship with this place: I love them when I can get to them, I hate that they\\'re only open weekdays. Unless I am off work, I literally cannot come here. Which is a shame, because their empanadas are great and I have been wanting to try their lomito sandwich and other items. \\n\\nThe empanadas are available in chicken, beef, ham and cheese, corn, mushroom and blue cheese, and vegetable varieties- and so far the mushroom version is my favorite, and freshly made to order. Buy way more than you think you\\'ll need because once you try them, you won\\'t want to share. Anxious for summer break to get here so I can pop by regularly and try more of the \\nmenu!\\nNearly 10 rave reviews so far and not a one of them mention that this spot exclusively uses chicken and pork?! No lamb or beef available for your gyro here, unfortunately. That said, their pita bread is incredible with a touch of wheaty flavor that makes it taste homemade, so their gyros are probably pretty legit.\\n\\nCame in and got thrown off by the lack of red meat, so I opted for a chicken gyro salad instead- large portion, fresh product, and a bomb Greek vin dressing with plenty of feta cheese. Unfortunately, the chicken was on the dry side and chopped so small that it mostly fell to the bottom of my dish. Oddly, their menu seems to be half Greek and half pizza. Considering how good their bread was, I\\'d actually consider coming back to see how they do with the pies.\\n\\nWalk up to the counter to order and then seat yourself. Dining room is plastered with vivid photo murals of Greece to daydream about a vacation while you wait for your food. Staff is friendly, offered samples of th\\neir rice pudding as I left. Would come back and try something else.\\nPopped in recently with some friends to share a dozen on a Saturday. Location is small and sparsely decorated but owner Dominic was friendly and engaged with us, talking about favorite flavors and bringing out a few specials for us to try- like the Afternoon Delight, a special-order PB&J flavor with a great grape filling that tasted spot-on like your favorite childhood sandwich!\\n\\nPrices are very reasonable here, with tiers for \"classic\" style (basic) donuts, a second \"tasty\" level with upgraded toppings or frostings, and \"fancy\" donuts ($2.25/ea) that are competitive with what other local spots are putting out, riffing on Girl Scout Cookie flavors and mixing in candy flavors. Favorites for me were the red velvet with cream cheese frosting and sprinkles, the Samoa flavor, S\\'Mores (great marshmallow fluff frosting!), and the aforementioned PBJ special. The apple fritter I sampled could have used more apple and the Blue M', 'actual_label': 27, 'predicted_label': 27}, {'text': 'agic (blueberry + cinnamon toast) was understated and underwhelming, but overall most donuts had great rise and weren\\'t too sweet. I\\'ll have to come back for the El Jefe, with horchata frosting and a fresh-fried piece of churro!\\n\\nNOTE: Only bottled refrigerated drinks available. Grab your coffee elsewhere!\\nAs we ate our lunch, the table was divided over whether our experienced rated an optimistic  four stars (me) or three (everyone else). Unfortunately, the dessert course took it down rather than up. It\\'s a good value for lunch, and the majority of four- and five-star reviews seem to be based on lunch experiences that emphasize the value: at $25.15 per person for a three-course pre-fixe, it\\'s not bad. But it\\'s not great, either. Diner who opted for the $16 wine pairing thought neither selection was particularly interesting, YMMV.\\n\\nAPPETIZERS: Table bread had a light char on it that infused a slightly burned taste, fellow diners were divided over whether this added to or detracted from \\ntheir enjoyment. Would appreciate herbs added to the decent-quality dipping oil. The mezze platter features various dips and crudités, the hummus was one of the best local versions I\\'ve had with a great texture. The tomato salad was simple and tasty but went unfinished with our group. The crab cake ($10 supp) was extremely good, but also unexpectedly tiny. The much-hyped grilled octopus ($10 supp), which I\\'d most been looking forward to, was well-flavored but disappointingly overdone and tough. I was bummed to see the scallop and calamari options visible on their website were not on the available menu.\\nMAINS: The sea bass lacked seasoning but was perfectly cooked, broccoli side was unremarkable. The shrimp saganaki lacked flavor and the shrimp themselves were overcooked and cold instead of hot, fresh, and juicy. Lobster Pasta ($15 supp) has beautiful presentation but received mixed feelings at our table: I enjoyed the light tomato sauce while others found it bland and complained about \\nthe lack of lobster content and flavor in the dish. The chicken skewer was nicely seasoned and juicy but fairly boring, however the fries were spectacularly well done and paired well with the tzatziki sauce.\\nDESSERT: We didn\\'t finish even half of any single dish from this course. The Greek yogurt was the only decent item, and had great texture, but could have benefitted from additional fruit garnish rather than a single berry and a drizzle of compote. Would have preferred this with honey and walnuts, as it was previously served. The fresh fruit plate looked like the dismal remains of a business meeting buffet. The walnut cake and ice cream was a dry, flavorless mess topped with an icy, flavorless glob. \\n\\nI like the option to do the pre-fixe but if nearly a third of the available options incur a fee that then doubles the price, why bother? The dishes are fresh and appealing, but the trend of overcooking-and-underseasoning dishes is a basic execution error I don\\'t expect to encounter on \\nthe Strip. Meal for four with coffees and  tip averaged to $50/pp and was underwhelming to all, which negated the \"great food for a great value\" claims that brought us in for our visit in the first place.\\nLike Nelson Q, I really wanted to love this place. But after reading so many positive reviews, I finally made it in for a meal- and was quite underwhelmed. Service was very friendly but the product was lackluster.\\n\\nOpted for their signature sando, the Streetcar Poboy, served with a side of coleslaw and Cajun chips. The bread that Emily R praises as craveworthy did not even taste fresh, which really brought down my impression of the overall sandwich. Topped with shrimp, oysters, and catfish, it was a hearty portion and didn\\'t have anything wrong with it, but it didn\\'t live up to the praise. I felt that Gritz Cafe better executed a poboy and it\\'s not even their main menu item.\\n\\nCajun chips served alongside my sandwich were bland, underseasoned, and seemed borderline stale. Service will \\nkeep this place on my radar to try their piroque and alligator on another visit, but I\\'m hoping I just caught them on an off night.\\nWell, the animals look active and healthy here, which is more than some other pet stores can say. Lots of rodents and birds, and an entire section of fish tanks to make your selection. Didn\\'t pay attention to whether they had saltwater fish available.\\n\\nCame in initially looking for a timed feeder for my cat so that I wouldn\\'t need to find a friend to feed him during a quick trip to California. Browsed the entire store looking for them but didn\\'t encounter any sales associates aside from the one at the register.\\n\\nFinally found one in the dog section- and only one. And at three times the going rate online. You\\'d think a place that specializes in pet supplies would have more than one- at this rate I feel like I would have been better off going to Walmart. And it probably wouldn\\'t have been $100 there.\\n\\nEDIT: Purchased the feeder, and my cat broke into it and ', 'actual_label': 27, 'predicted_label': 27}, {'text': 'sa.  Then we got two cups and a pitcher of water.  The lady did not say anything to us and left.  I was not sure if she is coming back or not.  ???  \\n\\nThen our server came to greet us.  She was very nice and told us the special.  She took our drink order and swoosh she was gone.  She had a ton of tables.  She came back quick with drinks and to take our food order.  \\n\\nI ordered the Comb #11 Chimi with chicken served with beans and rice.  The red sauce had good flavor, the chicken itself was bland, the rice was good, and normally I am not a fan of refried beans but theirs was pretty good.  \\n\\nTo sum up everything, it was ok.\\nI only went through the drive thur only.  I was in dying for some sugar!!!  I ordered a Venti ice blended vanilla frat no coffee with whipped cream.  My energy levels were shutting down.\\n\\n5 mins:  Drove up, place my order, got my drink the way I want, and drove off as a happy camper.\\n\\nI am re-charged so no poor soul is going to pay for my hangry mood.  LOL!\\nPer the we\\nbsite you can make a reservation, so for 7pm for 6 people I figure safe than sorry.  I called two days ahead and made a reservation.  When I walk into the place, I was confused about the concept of this restaurant.  You order at the counter then pay.  The employee will bring your drinks to your table, but the tables are covered in white tablecloths and silverware wrapped in white linen napkins.  Kind of like a better version of the Paradise Bakery?  \\n\\nSo we each lined up and ordered our entrees and drink.  We agreed to order desert after we eat.  I ordered the combo basket (catfish, chicken, and fries).  The employee set up tables for us, so we sat.  We noticed they are A bakery, A bar for outside patio, and they serve breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  Kind of crazy, seems they want to cover all bases of everything.  \\n\\nThe combo basket was $12, I got 1 piece of catfish and 2 pieces of chicken and a handful of fries.  The catfish and fries were good!!!  The chicken was soggy.  The price wa\\ns high for the amount of food I got.  We ordered 2 orders of beignets (3 pieces per order).  They were fried a little too long and they were too chewy.  I have had better beignets.  \\n\\nSo overall the food was ok, service was great, and the concept is confusing.  2.5 for food but the service rounded it up to 3 stars for me.\\nI have been to this location since Nov. 2015, I have several specialists (Yes, I see a whole TEAM of them) that reside in this building.  The service and staff is always professional and friendly.  I am so lucky to be treated here for my illness, plus my health insurance counts Mayo as in-network.   Also I was not treated correctly before I got to the Mayo Clinic.  If it was not for my specialist pushing for testing, I would be drooling now since the infection spread through out my body and got to my brain.  I look forward to being 100% me again.\\nWe love this place!  Great food and great music!\\n\\nWe inhaled a lot of food:\\nTostones - The best!\\nPasteles - Wow, it was goo\\nd!\\nPastellos - OMG, so good!  And the pastry was light and crispy.\\nPernil - The best dish as far as I am concern!  The flavors and tenderness.\\nMofono with Chicken - Mofono was great and the chicken was very tasty & moist\\nChuletas Fritas (prok chops) - It was a little dry.\\nArroz con Gandules - Yellow rice and peas (YUMMY)!\\nLove this place!  3 of us decided to meet early morning for a bday celebration for my 15 year goddaughter.  Small mom and pop shop with great service plus popping good FOOD!  I got the Ham and cheese crepe, my first savory crepe in a long time.  It was very very good.  I was too full to try a dessert crepe.  NEXT TIME!\\nMy brother and I went on a Saturday afternoon.  WOW, it is filled with people everywhere.  We thought boy the wait is going to be long.  They had two spots on the end of the counter and asked if the counter was ok?  Why not?  We want to sit and watch the action!!!  \\n\\nThey had 10+ people working the tables (serving, cleaning, etc.).  They are flying ever\\nywhere to get customers drinks and food as SUPER speeds.  Everyone seem to know what to do and everyone is helping each other.  So sum up the service, it is GREAT.  Someone is there to help you anytime.  \\n\\nI order the HUNGRY MAN breakfast:  3 scrambled eggs, 2 sauage links, 3 slices of sourdough, and a mountain of hash browns.  It was so much food, no way I can finish.  The scrambled eggs were real eggs (not that powder crap mix)!  Everything was good.  The toasted sourdough was so GOOD.

She mentioned they opened a few months ago and her brother (owner and chef) told her that she needed to come and help out.  \\n\\nI love the colors, the music, and the vibe of this place.  Reminds me of the Bahamas.  I got the Coco soda water drink, it was good (like coconut flavored Sprite).  They brought out tostones (fried plantains) with 2 dipping sauce (garlic with oil and ketchup, mayo, and garlic mix).  I love it.  I always like a sprinkle of salt with my tostone\\ns.  I ordered the Pernil (slow roasted pork shoulder) with arroz con gandules (yellow rice and pegoen peas) and red beans.  Everything has so much flavor!!!\\n\\nThe food is totally authentic!  It taste like my PR friend's mama's food.  A few more touches of spices then it will be just like my friend's mama's food.\\nThe food is always fresh and consistent from this location.  The service is always great too.  They have not screw up a take out order on us yet.\\nCame here for a lunch party.  The place was super decorated.  A little sensory overload.  We were 1 of 2 tables there.  And the service was slow.  I ordered the pad sei saw with chicken.  It was a little sweeter than I like, but it was ok.\\nThe place is big and great for a group.  The Italian ice is good and they give you the flavor of the day to sample.  I got the Joe-alto.  Italian ice with soft serve.  HELLO, happiness!  It was very good.  And a good place to just hang out too.\\nCame here for brunch with my friend.  We both had couldn\\n't locate the parking lot, so we parked on the streets (no big deal).  This place is cool...blast into the 50's or 60's!  I walked to the back and was greeted by the hostess (super sweet and friendly).  I was seated and glazed over the menu.  Lots of yummy choices.  The server swung by to check on me since I was still waiting for my friend.  She took my drink order and bought it to me ASAP.  My friend came and we decided to each order a breakfast dish and then split a dessert.  So I got the two eggs any style (scrambled), sausage, potatoes, and wheat toast.  And we split a stuff French toast.  Everything was good.  The French toast was awesome!  Only con was the server kept trying to refill my ice tea with ice brew.  It happened 2 of the 3 times.  I did not even bother to say something the 3rd time.  But I would come back!\\nHad lunch there with my ladies' monthly lunch group. They had some kind of event, so we are not allowed to park in the parking lot next to it. I had to turn around t\\no park on the street or the garage. I parked in the garage, because it had a sign that business' validate. \\n\\nSat in the patio since the weather is still nice. Ordered the corn beef melt sandwich. It took longer than usual. I did not see a lot of people, but who knows? Got our lunches. The bread was toasted so it was soft on the inside and crunchy on the outside. The corn beef was good (no salty). The swiss cheese melted perfectly on the corn beef. The potatoes are yummy. Service was OK. And they do not validate parking anymore.\\nThere are so many kinds of wines to pick from.  I was wandering up and down the aisles looking for my MIL's favorite wine.  To my surprise they did not carry it.  Then I went home to research doesn't seem they make this kind anymore?  Anyways, they have super helpful employees.  He suggested a sweet white wine.  I hope she likes it!!!\\nWe had another UFC party at the house, so I ordered pizza from Papa John's this time.

The coffee smells were so good!!!  We came here for treats after dinner.  We were greeted by the guy working in the behind the counter.  He told us to grab a seat and a waiter will be with us.  Cool!  \\n\\nWe sat for about 5 to 7 mins before someone came by.  We noticed some of the tables were a little dirty and an employee cleaned the table by wiping with his sleeves.  We finally got our orders in and the drinks and gelatos came out slow.  Only 3 of us had our stuff with the other 2 staring at us.  The homemade gelato was great.

She had homemade jams, fresh eggs, etc.  It was cool!  I got a jar of the raspberry rose \\njam.  My hubby LOVES it!  Caroline mentioned to check out her website too (www.BohoFarmandHome.com).  She participates at different events.  She offers tours by appointment only:  info@bohofarmandhome.com.\\nI dropped by this afternoon. The service guy that greeted me without any expression, \"What car wash are you getting?\" I answered. Then he said, \"OK, would you like to have your car detailed?\", I answered. Then he walked away turning his back to get the receipt. Walked back and handed me the receipt. I was standing there like OK? After 45 seconds, he said you are good to go. Just a weird dude. \\n\\nThe car wash and wipe down was very quick, clean, and nice. Nothing special. Later I spotted several small bird poop spots that did not come off. I had to wipe down the car again when I got home.\\nI got Annie tickets for my birthday.  I was so excited.  We got here and it was very nice set up.  We walked in to the main theatre and it was dinning tables set up and classy set up.  Loved the feel \\nof the place.  Everyone was dressed up nicely.  We had pretty good seats.  The staff was great.\\nWe had my brother wedding rehearsal dinner here for over 30 of us.  My parents made reservations and pre-ordered our food.  I\\'m surprised that even they pre-ordered our dinner over 2 weeks ago the food was mediocre.  The roast pork was all fat.  The beef chow fun was good.  The special soup was okay. The rest of the dishes were good but I had better.\\nAlways getting my greasy taste buds fix here.  I know it is bad, but sometimes I just want a burger and fries and FAST.  Got the ranch homestyle chicken this time.  It was good, fried, and served with ranch.  YUM!\\nCame with the parents.  I just started my cleanse and was looking for healthier options.  Guess what?  They have a whole section for that.  YES!!!  And it tasted good too!  PLUS!  The chicken was crusted in corn flakes which I can have and the steamed veggies were pretty tasty too.  Service was pretty good too.\\nNice place to meet up fo\\nr a working session.  We got to use the conference room.  My friend and I were there for at least 3 hours, we did not know.  We got a lot of work done and enjoyed the environment.  We are meeting up with round #2 soon!\\nParking sucked a little.  Parked in central Scottsdale (joking).  It was a walk.  Anyways, the theater is nice, clean, and has various of movies to pick from.  Got our tickets, got our seats, and enjoyed the movie.\\nWow this place is packed at lunch. We ordered how to look for a spot to sit. Then it did take around 10 minutes before we got our food. The taste of the food was okay. The service of the employees were awesome.\\nLove their chicken & waffles!!  We ate there for dinner one evening...  We could not get enough, came back the following week for lunch.  Just speaking of chicken & waffles, I need to make a visit again SOON!!\\nThe place is tucked into a corner in the shopping plaza.  The staff is SUPER nice.  I got the boneless chicken wings:  5 lemon pepper and 5 garli\\nc parm, order of fries, and I got a drink for tree with the purchase of fries...  SWEET!  The fries were very good.  Crispy and crunchy...  The chicken was boneless and a little hard.  The flavors are STRONG!  SUPER STRONG.  Almost a little too much.  I maybe should have gotten the actual chicken wings instead.  I will come back to try the chicken wings.\\nOk, I think I am going to be booed for this.  Yes, 2 stars!  I have heard so much great things about their food at the Tempe location.  Bummed when I finally had time they closed and was moving to the Mesa location.  So when L said they are open NOW, lets go I was drooling...  =)  \\n\\nThe Mesa location is new, nice, and clean.  It was pretty roomy too.  Got there at 6:20pm, we had a reservation for 6 to 7 people at 6:30pm.  They tired to give us a table for 4, so we had to stress that we have 6 to 7 people.  They sat us in a corner table but it was only for 5.  We had to ask for 2 more chairs twice.  Service was very slow (snail speed).

She told us that the kitchen was backed up and was going to put our ticket in in 5 mins so all the dishes would come out together and hot.  \\n\\nOk.  fast foward to 7:50pm.  The app was licked clean, drinks are empty, and we are straving.  After watching a few tables that came after us eat and left, we were feeling like did they lose our ticket?  We flagged the another server down to check because we have not see our server for the last 20 mins or more.  She told us our ticket is 4th  in line, but she couldn't tell us how much longer.  How did our ticket get push that far back?  Especially watch people that came after us get food.\\n\\nThe owner, she was making her rounds with the tables.  She came to \\nours and thought we were finished.  Oh NO, we have not received our food yet.  We told her we have been waiting for almost 1 hour.  I have proof, I have been bored and I was taking pictures and the time is stamped on them.  The owner came back from the kitchen with the POS receipt and said we didn't put in our order until 7:28pm.  OH NO, we gave our order to the server a little after 7pm, if she choose to sit on it for over 20 mins that is not my problem.  YOU JOKING?  The serve came back and told us I told you I was going to put your order in after 10 mins.  Oh no, you said 5 min.  Either way, ordered at 7:05 + 10 mins = 7:15pm not 7:28pm.  They blamed that it was that we were waiting for people.  So how in the heck did you get their orders if they were not here yet?  WHAT?  OK, now I am hungry and pissed.  It is 8;05pm now.  My butt can tell me how long I have been sitting.  \\n\\nAt 8:19pm the food FINALLY got here.  And guess what?  Some of the orders were wrong; most of the food was o\\nn a cold plate with luke warm food; and then a food runner showed up with an extra plate of food.  OMG, what a cluster fxck!  We were scope sides of other's plates and trading food until we assembled something close to what we ordered.  \\n\\nWe were finished eating and then the wait for the bills.  We all had our wallets out and were ready.  She dropped off the bills and we asked her for a box togo.  Nothing.  Then she came back to pick up the money & bills.

Yes, we will be coming back to this place!!\\n\\nWe ordered the Non-Veg Assorted Snack (Seesh Kebab, Fish Pakoras & C\\nhicken Pakoras) for an appertizer.  The Seesh Kebab was minced lamb mixed with spcies cooked on skeker in clay oven, not like the normal kebab you think it is.  The taste was different, not my cup of tea.  But the fish and chicken Parkora was very good.\\n\\nFor our entrees ordered up a Karahi Lamb-Boti Masala (boneless tansoori lamb in a tomatoe and butter gravy) and Chicken Biryani (basmati rice with chicken cooked with nuts, herbs, raisins, and spices).  The Karahi Lamb dish was served as medium and the Chicken Biryani was served as mild.  The lamd dish was too HOT for me (but then I am a super lightweight), but the flavor was good.  I loved my Chicken Biryani, the aromatic rice, herb, and spices was just wonderful to smell and taste.  The waitress suggested the Garlic Naan bread.  It was like a pita with small chunks of garlic and herb.  It was very tasty too.  \\n\\nWe got to chatting with the owners.  They were very patience to explain what everything was and give us different sauces to \\ntry (cucumber yogurt, minty cream, etc.) with our dishes.  They also brought out a sample of the Kheer (rice pudding), my husband inhaled it.  He loved it!\\nWe found a special on a printer and we got it.  The cashier was nice enough to let us not to forget the connection cable.  OMG, we ran back and got one.  :)\\nCame here for lunch with a coworker.  The place is a good size but mostly empty.  Besides burgers they have Mexican food.  I got the bacon cheeseburger with fries.  It was OK, meat was thin.  Just OK.  The tables could have been cleaned or cleaner.\\nFantastic chicken strips!

Yummy, warm, right amount of butter, and not burnt!  \\n\\nI ordered the new york strip with bearniase sauce on the side and parmesan potato stack as the side.  The NY strip was cooked perfectly and tasted very very good.  I liked that I could taste the beef flavor, it was a good cut of meat.  YUM YUM!  The parmeasan potato stack was excellent!  Everyone else enjoyed their meals too (prime rib - cowboy cut, calves liver, top sirlion, and crunchy fried shrimp platter).  \\n\\nWe worked our way to dessert too:  Mixed berry shortcake and chocolate chip fudge brownie.  Both desserts were so so so so SO GOOD!\\nWas invited to a breakfast birthday bash with 15 of my friends.  The place was smaller than I thought because they accepted our reservation for 16.  We were lined up against the window wall and pretty tight squeeze sitting inside.\\n\\nThe service was pretty good for 2 waiters vs. 16 of us and their other tables.  We did have to ask for refills.\\n  I ordered the meat lover omelet (Three eggs, pecan smoked bacon, sausage, ham and white cheddar), roasted potatoes, & sourdough toast.  I think they found to add the white cheddar cheese to my omelet or it was a super small amount.  Basically a fluffy eggs folded in the meats with no cheese.  It was ok.  The potatoes were good! \\n\\nThe rest of the menu looks greats, I would come back for 1 more try.\\nThis location is similar layout to all the other stores.  Employees are nice and helpful.  Sales were great and the extra % off coupons help too.\\nWith all the good yelp ratings, I was disappointed in the visit and the food.  When we were seated, I walked passed the kitchen and saw the ribeye. \\n OH man...  Smells so good.   I got my food and it was a little tasteless, but the house fries were good.

We only had 1 red crunched pepper between 9 people.

(shrimp, baby clams, mussels and calamari in spicy red clam sauce)\\n\\nSpaghetti with Meatballs - This was another tasteless dish.  The meatballs was horrific.  The meat was low grade and after eating it, I lost my appet\\nite.  I don't think it was meat at all.  YUCK!\\n\\nWe waited 45 mins for tasteless dishes.....   And spend a couple hundred of dollars.\\nCame here for dinner, 30 mins before they closed.  It was a cold night and needed something to warm me up.  The place is clean and shiny new.  The selection is a little limited compared to the other pho places that I go.  I ordered the #5 beef pho noodles.  It was good, not too shabby of a soup base either.

I should have gotten 1 scope.  I got the nutty coconut and chocolate almond.  Just as yummy as I remember.\\nI was there with a group of 20 people for hour happy, it was packed at 5pm when I arrived. I sat with my group. It took over 10 mins before I could get our server's attention. After that, every time I needed a refill or anything I need to wait to get her attention. It was a great place to hang out with friends, but not impressed by the service.\\nWent for a express wash.  In and out in 10 mins or less.  Nothing special.\\nStaff is friendly.  But the inventory and selection is a little lacking.\\nPros...plenty of parking, lots of stores, good deals when you fin\\nd them.\\n\\nCons...crowded to the gills, deals if you find them, some of the shoppers are rude.\\nWOW!  They have everything here.  Cards, gifts, dresses, trinkles, balloons, etc.  NICE!\\nI had high hopes to try their hot dogs.  I got the beef dog but it was ok, a little too charred for my taste.

Got there noticed 3 different bar stations, 1 dance floor, 1 bull ride area, and outside patio. The music was a weird mix (hip hop, pop, rock n roll, with a mix of country). It is OK. The crowd was a mix of 20 to 30s, and drop in a few 40s+. D\\nrinks were expensive!\\nI think it is THE place to go on Sunday afternoons.  It is packed like crazy.  Lines out of the door, people hoover around for tables, etc.  We placed our order and everyone is scrambling to find a place to sit.  Of course, the table is dirty...we wiped it out ourselves.  Our food came out to us, and of course someone was missing their meal.  The turkey & brie sandwich was ok, bland.  The potato soup was very good.  They did not give us enough silverware and we needed to flag someone down for that.  For the money spent, I rather go to a full service restaurant.\\nDr.  Charous is worth the wait to see him.

We cleaned, scrubbed, vaccumed, stocked, swiped, etc. for a few hours.  The staff was very friendly and appreciate our time and support.

You expect the food from the IHops to taste somewhat the same.  My sampler was good, but the pancake was not.  I was not sure what it was??  Batter is old?  My parents mentioned the same thing that their pancakes were not very good either.  So, I am not crazy yet.

It is tucked in between two other stores, I missed it the first time.  I walked in and was greeted by the lady employee doing a manicure on a customer.  I told her I needed a GC.  She stopped the manicure and helped me.  I noticed the place only had 6 pedicure chairs and 3 to 4 nail stations, but only 2 employees.  I can see why they are slow.\\nI have not been here in a LONG time.  I remember the burgers are YUM!  But The Frenchy sandwich on the menu was screaming \"GET ME, GET ME, ORDER ME!\".  But my friend saw that I was torn so she ordered the Vigazz Burger and offered to share.  So, I had 1/2 a Frenchy and 1/2 the Vigzz Burger.  WOOOOOOOOO....\\n\\nFrenchy - SO GOOD!  Love the dipping sauce.\\nVigazz Burger - The zing from the sauce, Yum!  Cook to perfection burger.\\nFrench Fries - Love those skinny fries with the seasoning.\\n\\nThe service was great!!!\\nIt is a small place if you have more than 4 dining.

It is small at the bar area.  We were finally seated, it took a little to get our drink and food order.  They were packed and busy.  We ordered the board (cheeses, breads, humus, etc.).  It was very good.  I ordered the beef dip with french fries.  It was very good.  Very flavorful and good crispy fries.  Small con was getting the server's attention for a refill.\\nAlways a fan and love their food.  The 14th Street pizza is my favie but this time it tasted different.  It was good but it was not GREAT!!!  =(  The service was great.\\nSO SO SO SO SO SO SO GOOD!  AWESOME!  We came here with all the great review.  We got bread (complimentary).  I got the meatball soup (best I have every had).  The gnocchi with vodka sauce was fantastic, gnocchi was cooked to perfection.  The pizza was just plain freaking awesome.  Thin crust, not soggy!!  One of the best pizza I have ever had.  A\\nnd then the tiramisu was perfect (not too sweet) and the cake was moist and not mushy.  The service was great too.  Caution, this place is buried in the end of the little shopping center (rough area), but it is worth it for GREAT food.\\nThe green ice tea and environment was great!  The staff was so nice.  They need more big comfy chairs.\\nBought my CC there last month.  The sale person Adam was awesome.  We were in, test drove it, Adam made us an offer, we had an offer back, and done deal.  We were in and out of the finance office less than 30 mins.  SWEET!  \\n\\nAny minor complaint was they lost the 2nd key fob and took over 2 weeks to find one or replace one for me.  =(  But they did offer a free to off on my gas.\\nWe came here for a day at the spa.  We kicked off our visit to Prado for brunch.  Love the place and the surroundings.  We were greeted right away and had the choice to sit inside or outside.  I chose inside since it was a little warm still.  \\n\\nThe server was a little slow in dr\\ninks, refills, getting the bill, and she forgot to bring a drink.  She was hard to flag down or get attention of.  \\n\\nI ordered the ham and cheese omlette, it was ok.  Bland, just bearly cooked to done and just not too great.  The potatoes were not fully cooked, still crunchy.  \\n\\nMeh...\\nCame here on a Friday night with my family.  Like the atmosphere (modern and happening) not too loud.  My family order a WHOLE table of food.  I got the Miso Soup and Fish and Chips.  Yes, I ordered Fish and Chips.  The fish was panko!  Everything was tasty.  The service was good.\\nLove the drive up & drop off donations for patrons.\\nNever had a Thai Royal Massage before, I have had only the regular Swedish or Sport massages.  I didn't realize it is head to toe plus foot reflexology.  You soak your feet in warm water as they lay out down on your back.  I was worked over my clothes (pulled, pushed, yoga like stretching, etc).  She worked on my feet with pressure points.  It was really quiet and I barely hea\\nrd her whisper her name.  I was asked to turn over on my stomach and she began my back treatments.  NICE!   A few cons I was so close to the next chair that the other therapist kept running into my arm and the chairs were not that comfortable.  It was very relaxing and body felt great afterwards.\\nWe were here for another birthday party for M.  We ordered a board with cheese meat and bread it was very good. Then we all ordered our entrees and those were very good as well. The rest of the group had drinks of the alcohol kind and they were very happy. The only thing that was a missed that the service was a little bit off and on.  But we had a definitely a great time and have great food.\\nWent on rainy Sunday...  Loved it.  Free parking and easy to find.  Hiked trail #5 and then a parts of another trail (but it was not marked)... ???  But it was up and on the side of the mountains (good calve workout).\\nWings are good.  Crispy and flavored right!  But the place was very dirty from the drink \\narea to tables.  I would recommend to go!\\nI ordered a soup and a chicken teriyaki bowl. All the food was okay. I only got to go so I couldn't tell you about the service or environment of the inside of the store I didn't stay too long. But the employee that was taken my order was very helpful and telling me what are their specials.\\nLGO - I am in love with you!  First, you wow me with breakfast (your muffins melt me).  Then your drinks and sweets.  I finally had time to try your pizza.  Why didn't I come sooner?  Boy, I was missing out.  I got the gladiator pizza.  It was very good:  thin crust, crust was tasty, cheese was so flavorful, the sausage was full of flavors too, and there was pepperoni hiding between the crust and the cheese.  The cheese pizza was great too.  My mouth and tummy was a happy camper.  \\n\\nWhy 4 stars?  The service.  It was slow, had to ask for refills, and just painfully to get your server's attention.

The staff is very helpful.  Spacious inside and out.  They open pretty late, so it was nice to sit and chat with friends after dinner.\\nThree of us tried this place for dinner today.  Not bad at all for a wing joint.  We had the one of the pizza/wing specials (30 Wings and 1 XL pizza with 1 top).  They let us split the wings..  10 HOT, 10 medium, and 10 mild.  We ordered a pepperoni for the 1 item.  The service was great.  The waiters came be a lot to check on us.  \\n\\nWings were saucy and still crispy!  Pizza was thin and cheesy!  Everything was good...  The price on the drinks are not bad either.. Lot of TVs, so many things to watch.  Yeah, we will be back!\\nWe went back on a Sunday afternoon at the \"NEW\" & bigger place.  We got a quote of\\n 30 mins for a table. Since there was 2 of us, we decided to sit at the counter for no wait.  Our server greeted us quickly and took our drink order.  Our drinks came and he took off quickly.  He came back 5 mins later and took our food order.  \\n\\nWe both ordered the Chicken Fried Steak served with hash browns, eggs, and instead of toast I got french toast.  The chicken fried steak was good, the country gravy was spot on.  The hash browns and eggs were good too.  The french toast was meh...  I should have gotten the pancakes.  \\n\\nThe server came back to give our check.  He did not come back to see if things were ok.  They service seems to be more dis-engaged this time around.\\nThe wait was CRAZY long for a table for 3 - quoted 1 hour and 15 mins.  After waiting for 25 mins, we saw an opening on the bar for 3 we took it and told them to remove us from the wait list.  The service at the bar was OK.  Too many thing happening for the staff.  I got the lime parm chcicken wings, the flavor on t\\nhem were good and strong.  I ordered the chicken parm too.  It was just OK flavors just weren\\'t there.\\nI liked the big parking lot, decor, and space in the dining area.  We had a party of 10 and they took reservations.  Plus plus plus plus!!!  We were seated swiftly and our server came over immediately to take our drink orders.  She was back right away with our drinks.  We had to wait for some of the others in our party to show up.  After waiting 10 mins, we were noitifed that the others were not showing up.  BOO. We got the server\\'s attention and she came over to take our order.  I ordered the meat lover omlette.  The eggs were a little too done but tasty flavor.  The potatoes were good too.  The service was excellent!!!  Never an empty cup and she bought an extra plate without us asking for the kids.  She even offered togo ice teas for us.  WHOA.\\nI\\'ve been to this place a few times and I absolutely love it.  The food is excellent and the service is great. I especially love all the ap\\npetizers. But everytime I get here I have to order the yellowtail collar early just to make sure they have it.  Check out the specials on the board.  And also I love there pick two type of menu selection.  I get an appetizer and some kind of rice bowl.\\nThe service was prompt and friendly.  The place is new and clean.  The chairs are a little uncomfortable, but I don\\'t mind for food.  I have eaten standing on the streets in Hong Kong, Mexico, Jamaica, and NYC for great food.  We came here on a Saturday night after a game, the place was 1/3 full.  I got to try these items:\\n\\n1.  Roti Cani - Indian pancake served with a side of curry dipping sauce.  It is a light crispy bread, pretty good but the curry dipping sauce was spicy (ok for me).\\n2.  Chicken Wings - 4 pcs fried crispy with Malaysian spices.  Best tasting item from all the items I tried that night, crispy, juice, and well seasoned.  \\n3.  BP Wrapped Chicken - Seasoned chicken wrapped in foil and deep fried.  It was flavorful but jus\\nt OK.\\n4.  Thai Ice Tea - It was perfectly sweetened.\\n5.  Pork Chop Noodle Soup - Noodle soup served with seasoned fried pork chop on the side.  The pork chops were on the salty side and too dry.  And the noodle soup was completed bland.  You have to add a bit of the pork chop with every spoonful of noodle and soup to get some flavor.  \\n\\nThe kitchen made a mistake with my friend\\'s order.  They brought her the Kway Teow Mee (comb of flat rice noodle and egg noodle) instead of the Mamak Mee Goreng (egg noodles) away to ask if she wanted to take it.  She said no, then all our of order came out and she was waiting for a good 10 mins before her correct order came out.\\nIf you like dodging shopping carts in the parking lot, then this is the Walmart for you.  If you are looking for a shopping cart in the store, good luck.  The place is packed with rude people.  They are stocked out on bottled water.

The grounds were well kept.  \\n\\nThe pool area was walking distance.  2 large pools (1 pool had a waterfall, volleyball, and basketball), 2 hot tub areas, 1 kiddie pool.  \\n\\nStayaction for the weekend!\\nThis place is nice, clean, and super small.  The staff was ok, a little slow.  I ordered the fried egg rolls (yum) and then the pork chop plate.  1 thin pork chop for like $7 or $8.  Could have gave me a second one for that price.  The flavor was ok too.\\nWe were seated quickly, but the table was barely dry from being cleaned.  The booths had crumbles, I just used the menus to wipe the seats.  The server came back quick to get drink orders.  I ordered the baked p\\notato skillet:  2 fresh eggs* any style atop fresh, seasoned potatoes, bacon, roasted onions, sour cream, scallions & tomatoes. Served with an English muffin.  The food was very bland!  I normally don't add salt to my food, but I had to!  Our server was nice and very attentive.\\nI went to look for workout gloves.  I am getting man hands!!!  LOL!  The sales lady guided me to want I am looking for but the sizes were not the right ones.  She ran to the back or other area.  She found the color and size I need.  WOOT!\\nI never find the things I need here!  And I am still pissed at not getting my $150 rebate (from 5 years ago).  Bought a wash/dryer and they ran a promo for getting a rebate, they LOST my original store receipt when I initially submitted it.  Then they will NOT accept a copy of the receipt, WTF!  I only come here when I absolute need to.\\nI rented a full size, but they did not have one ready.  They offered a free upgrade to a SUV.  So, we took it.  In and out in less than 10 mins\\n.  NICE!  \\n\\nWe were suppose to bring back the rental on Wednesday at 6pm, but due to traffic in CA we missed the 6pm closing time.  We called before hand to inform them we were going to be late due to traffic.  The branch manager, William Ray said if I bring back the rental by 7:30am on Thursday, they will not charge me extra.  But I did receive a call from another person from the branch said that they will charge me when I was on the road.  I told him was William said and all he said was but you are late.  Maybe I will charge you 1/2 a day???  WTF!!!  \\n\\nWhen I returned the rental on Thursday morning, I did not say anything to see what the charges were.  No, they did not charge me an extra day or charges.  And I was out of there in 5 mins.  I am not sure what the mis-communication was but in the end it worked out.\\nI am not sure why the hype for Freddy's.  2.5 start at the best.  The burgers are ok (meat is so thin, you can  almost see through it), fries are good, frozen custard is ok. \\n Maybe I like my burgers a little meatier?\\nThis place is big and has several entrances.  It was good for a large group hang out and a small play area for kids!  There is a patio area too, but too HOT to sit outside right now.  The service was very slow but the server was nice.  I don't know if they are lack of servers or just slow in service.  My party were already seated and I did not see them.  LOL!  But thanks to modern technology - the cell phone I can text them.  :)  Found out their were sitting in the back area and if I would have worn my glasses I would have spotted them.  Getting old!!!  I got The Jesse (bacon cheeseburger).  It was ok.  I am not sure if I tasted red's sauce or not.  The french fries were good.  The food delivery was very slow too.  Maybe it was an off night or something.  I would be back to try this place again.\\nSunday brunch is BUSY!  We waited 25 mins for a table for 5.  This is the new location.  The place is packed and LOUD inside.  We were seated in the b\\nack.  \\n\\nThe table was a little sticky and the laminated menus were wet.  Our server greeted us immediately and took our drink orders.  The menu is simple and short, love it.  But I am with indecisive people.  The server had to come back twice before everyone decided on what to order.  \\n\\nI ordered the The Crying Pig omelet (Bacon, Sausage & Swiss cheese) and hash browns.  The omelet was a little over done on the edges but perfect in the middle.  The hash browns were good and greasy!  I ordered a 1/2 order of the french toast to share with other person.  The 1/2 piece I got tasted kind of burnt but the part that was not tasted great.  \\n\\nI am with Michael F. on this place 3 for the food and 4 for the service.  Overall 3.5 stars.\\nThanks Yelp for luring me to donuts!  I got a ham and cheese croissant plus 4 donuts (buttermilk, vanilla cake, glazed, and bavarian filled).

They made the playoffs, not by the skin of their teeth barely eeking into 8ths place but did so in a convincing fashion finishing 5th in the East. \\n\\nMoving into this years playoffs, the had to take on one of their biggest obstacles, the 2011 Stanley Cup Champion Boston Bruins, whom they had lost 9 of their last 11 meetings to. A team that certainly had their number! But did they give up? NO! Our boys in blue pulled it together and took Boston to the edge of a 7th game in overtime before losing to a more experi\\nenced squad, NOT a better squad. \\n\\nI write this review of your performance to say THANK YOU! Thank you for a fantastic season and proving to Toronto fans that we really do have one of the best teams in the NHL and we \"BeLEAF\" in you all!\\n\\nWith renewed faith in our team, I anxiously look forward to supporting you guys without a question next season!!!\\nLast night a group of GTA yelpers decided to take part in their first dinner during the recent launched Savour Mississauga. The great thing about promotions like this is that they encourage you to get out into your local community and try restaurants again or for the first time.\\n\\nI chose Solstice because of its great $35 prix fixe menu, and the fact that it was a virtual unknown to the Yelp community. Nestled in the heart of the Mississauga neighbourhood of Clarkson Village (Southdown Rd and Lakeshore W), Solstice is Italian fine dining where they believe in producing a quality product and experience from the moment you enter.\\n\\nMy Yelp ami\\ngo Bernie C has already regaled you with the details of the meal so I\\'ll focus on the items I ate that were different and the extra details I found out on speaking with Vince (one of the owners). \\n\\nFor my appetizer I decided to go with the Soup of the Day, as opposed to Bernies Charcuterie style platter, which today was a shrimp bisque . I could smell the creamy shrimp aromas from the moment it was walked into the dining room, and that same smell followed exactly as the velvety texture of the soup slid across my tongue. The best parts about this dish was that while it had a shrimp smell and taste, neither of them were overwhelming, a well balanced dish overall. ALSO, the soup of the day portion size was wonderful, no skimping as a full piping hot bowl was put out before me.\\n\\nSimilar to many others at our table we took the road more frequently traveled and ordered the surf and turf entree. The shrimp were succulent and perfectly cooked (so you got that \"pop\" when you pit into one). As f\\nor the steak and seasonal veggies, a perfect 7oz medium rare cut of beef sliced up real nice for me in advance!\\n\\nTo close off my meal I decided to avoid the sweets and have the cheese platter, which with my luck today had blue cheese, hunks of parmigianno, a smoked cheddar and a slice of brie. Paired with some fresh fruit, a double espresso (which kept me up until 4am this morning) and a light Amaro digestivo I was in Italo-heaven!!!\\n\\nWithout delving too much further into the culinary mastery of this place, I will say that for a restaurant week prix fixe menu, the Solstice brings some serious value to the table. If this is an indication into the type of work they do day to day, I\\'d highly recommend you pay them a visit anytime of year!\\n\\nSome parting fun facts about Solstice:\\n- Owned by 3 brothers\\n- Their mother makes the in house biscotti (which we got to sample last night)\\n- The have the largest private dining room in Mississauga inside a restaurant which can host 90 guests (perfect f', 'actual_label': 29, 'predicted_label': 29}, {'text': 'or corporate functions or special occasions)\\n\\nLooking forward to a return to Solstice in the near future when they release a highly-anticipated new item on their menu which will blow your socks off... stay tuned!!!\\n\\nEatcrest Out!\\nHoly Schnitzel Batman!! Last night a group of us assembled for a taste of something new, central european cuisine at the recently rebranded, redesigned, renamed and reopened Schnitzel Hub (formally Schnitelland).\\n\\nIt\\'s a small restaurant with seating for about 25, but it feels warm and homey - truly a place you feel welcomed. I made reservations for our group and they were great at confirming and reminding me of the reso and double checking numbers in advance.\\n\\nUpon arrival, I went to check in and discovered that when you check-in on the Yelp app they provide $1 off of a pint of Hacker Pschorr beers - sweet!\\n\\nA fun fact about this place is that they infuse all their own vodkas with a variety of flavours. This was to be one of our \"must-try\\'s\" but by the time w\\ne finished our meal and beers there wasn\\'t much room for even the smell of delicious flavoured vodkas.\\n\\nNow on to the food! To begin I had an order of their perogies (the potato and cheddar filled ones), boiled and lightly fried and topped with fried onions - they were magical, but a portion for $10 was a good started to share given that there were about 10-15 in the serving.  Following that, I simply couldn\\'t visit a spot with a namesake such as this without having the wiener Schnitzel, and being a purist, I wanted to be sure I had the OG-Schnitz (also the best name for a Bavarian Rap superstar) aka the regular/plain weiner (veal) schnitzel.\\n\\nAs my friends before me have mentioned, the schnitz here is HUGE... the portion sizes are full plate and easily more than one person (or Wayne C) can handle on their own. I\\'m pretty sure I ordered spätzle as my side but you wouldn\\'t know it because the massive portion of spätzle and cooked veg was covered by an even more massive portion of schnit\\nzl. I got through about half before tapping out.\\n\\nThe ONLY minor item I think they need to work on is adding more staff, our one server was really great and did her best to serve our table and the others in the restaurant, but with only one cook and one server, food arrived in waves with long gaps, she was apologetic and really did her best (I think we all tipped her well as a thanks for her hard work). Management just needs to provide some more support which will in turn help with turning over tables faster.\\n\\nGreat Schnitzel and a great night!\\n\\nEatcrest Out!\\nCame here for the fist time to watch a movie recently and enjoyed my experience. This VIP Cinema replaced the older Cineplex in First Markham Place and is a massive and much needed upgrade for Markham.\\n\\nWhy the 3 stars? Well it\\'s as you would expect a Cineplex to be and ticks all the boxes of what a theatre would be. My concerns, which may be alleviated with future visits revolve around the following points.\\n\\n1) Odd flow. The box \\noffice is on the main floor of the indoor mall it resides in, while the theater is up stairs and around the corner. If you\\'re not familiar with the set up, as I was on this visit, it can make meeting up with others a little confusing. Plus when the box office line ups begin to get longer it ends up impeding the main corridor of the mall\\n\\n2) Odd smell. Once upstairs safely I noticed a really awful smell in the entrance way to the theatre. It was a mix of urine in an underground parking garage, sweat and somehow popcorn.  This might have been a temporary thing but many of my guests who joined me commented on the same smell. It\\'s not exactly inviting and definitely something you need to hold your breath to get through.. yikes!\\n\\nI have yet to experience their VIP set up, so another star is definitely pending upon my next visit.\\n\\nOverall, it\\'s a movie theatre. It has popcorn, a full food menu, drinks and movies. Check it out and let me know what you thought.\\nDiet be dammed, it was hot, I wa\\ns walking the streets of Port Credit (yes.. again), and I needed to cool my heels (and every other part of my body). As I stopped to rest on a bench I took notice of the people walking past me with glorious scoops of ice cream and fro-yo. \\n\\nI turned and realized I had taken refuge in the shade provided by Scoops awning. Not one overlook an obvious sign, I ventured in to tempt my fate. Knowing I wanted to cool down, have something delicious AND be healthy I asked what my choices were. \\n\\nAfter the staff ran me through about 50 different flavours, the informed that if healthy and delicious was my goal, that there made to order fro-yo should do the trick. I agreed and ordered possibly the largest SMALL I\\'ve ever seen. Thankfully they had my fave combo of frozen strawberries and banana on hand to make this and I soon walked out $4 paid and $100 happier!\\n\\nCool off here this summer (and maybe winter), I hear they make a mean Milkshake as well!\\n\\nEatcrest Out!\\nWhoa!

I decided to give a whirl this time as my thirst exceeded past judgments and wow, it totally redeemed itself. It wasn\\'t scary inside at all, just a classic local pub with a massive wooden bar, small dance floor and an abundance of large flat screen TVs facing every possible direction (so you can watch from anywhere in the restaurant).\\n\\nTheir beer selection is domestic mostly with a few well known foreign premiums on tap as well. There even was a couple of one-off craft beers but none that I heard of before.\\n\\nAs for the menu, I was super into the idea of having a Sloppy Joe, I mean where do you ever see those on a menu? But then as I looked over the pictures on Yelp I\\n was swayed to ordering chicken wings as most reviews and pictures bragged about how great these were. You can order either 10 or 20 wings on the menu (that\\'s approximately 1.5 or 3 pounds of wings) in a variety of standard sauces. I opted for the 20 as I\\'m accustomed to tiny pub wings. Not here. In what I thought was a very long time later (for chicken wings) a pile of large wings was placed before me - these were not \\'standard\\' by any means and their size made clear to me the extra cooking time likely needed to make these perfect.\\n\\nThese were some of the plumpest, moist, delicious wings I\\'ve had in some time. Perfectly cooked through and perfectly sauced (hot and honey for me). Not one wing was burned or over cooked on the outside and they were so hot that I could barely hold them for too long!!! Ordering 20 for one person was definitely too much for me, I couldn\\'t even finish them, there were still about 4 left, and I\\'m pretty sure I was full by my 10th or 11th wing.\\n\\nQuite a review\\n, I know, for chicken wings but these were a big surprise and definitely a hidden gem in my opinion. If you\\'re near Longbranch and Lakeshore look up Sloppy Joes and come for the wings (or try a sloppy joe).\\n\\nEatcrest Out\\nPho is wonderful on cold days, rainy days, days that are both, and those that are everything in between. Heck, sometimes it\\'s just satisfying to go ham on a bowl for kicks - the feeling at the end is like nothing else, full but not stuffed, warm and fuzzy. Heaven.\\n\\nI got a lead on some really exceptional Pho being dolled out in Downtown Brampton by some local pals, so given that it was lunch time, I was in the area and I had missed breakfast - this was a win on all sides for me.\\n\\nIt\\'s not elegant or crazy fancy inside, it\\'s simple, and that\\'s what a good Pho spot needs ot be, simple with a focus on good food. It\\'s definitely family owned and operated and despite my comment about the simplicity of the space it\\'s also Super clean (rigorously so as the staff seemed to be \\ncleaning or tidying constantly while I was there) - good sign because if they\\'re that conscious of the restaurant being clean then you can bet that same attention to detail is taken with the food.\\n\\nAnd it was! I walked in and without looking at the menu knew I was going to have a #9 (Special Pho with everything - Beef tendon, rare beef, beef balls and brisket) in a medium size.\\n\\nThe medium was more than enough when it hit the table and the broth looked perfect. Not overly oily and no visible signs of negatives. Quality! I decided to dispense with my usual Hoisin and sriracha sauce overload and just added the thai basil, chili pepper and sprouts. WOW. The true flavours of the broth were incredible. Clean and full of rich beef flavour - I was hooked. Noodles were a little clumped together at the beginning but they gradually moved apart and were also cooked perfectly.\\n\\nThe real star of the dish tho was the meat, incredibly high quality, I was shocked! I could taste the seasoning in the be\\nef balls, and they didn\\'t have that rubbery feel that some do. The brisket melted in my mouth it was so tender, and the rare beef and tendon were both equally amazing\\n\\nTotal bill came to just over $9 (tax in). Are you kidding? Amazing!\\n\\nThis spot is a little bit of a trek from my place but it\\'s my personal new go-to spot when in Brampton. Check it out!\\n\\nEarcrest Out!\\nPart of the reason why I love my intern is we have very different food cravings at different times. On this particular day, I was unsure what I was craving but she had a Dim Sum craving that would rival that of pregnant women who crave Pickles and Ice cream. I was scared (a little) so I complied and we found ourselves at Skyview Fusion.\\n\\nNow as my intern informed me, there is nothing \\'Fusion\\' about this place, it\\'s a Dim Sum joint and a higher end one at that. Apparently fusion is one of those overused terms among Asian restaurants to make themselves sound more diverse. I learn something new everyday - so reader beware of ', 'actual_label': 29, 'predicted_label': 29}, {'text': \"future fusion spots.\\n\\nI'll get the negatives out of the way first: Pretty pricy Dim Sum ($44 + tip) for two people AND, as many have already said, service was pretty shotty - even though the place wasn't too busy.\\n\\nThat said, food is fantastic, standouts were the Sui Mai, Har Gow, the BBQ pork pun, Soup dumplings, OH OH and the steamed bun with sweetened egg yolk in the center (definitely an artery clogger)... actually to be fair pretty much everything (even the tripe) was excellent.\\n\\nBathrooms were modern and extremely clean, and IF price is a concern, don't avoid this place as the daily early bird special runs from 9am-11am - however you must submit order sheet before 10:50am.\\n\\nEatcrest Out!\\nAs I sit and write this review, I find it difficult to not think back and reflect on the many meals that I've had here in past for lunch that I've truly enjoyed. Today, however was nothing more and nothing less than a 3 star experience. \\n\\nThis takeaway or sit down spot has a great location just n\\north of Hwy 7 and Yonge in Richmond Hill. It's simply put together and decorated and the staff are friendly and really relaxed about when you order and when you pay. I've always liked this place for a quick, inexpensive meal on the go.\\n\\nWas this the best Shawarma I've ever had? No. What I was served was a small portion a top of my shawarma salad. The beef was slightly dried and crunchy and a little over cooked. This is not the norm for this place at all!\\n\\nThe salad however was good, I like the chopped tomato chuncks and cucumber and their tahini and tzatziki sauces make a great salad dressing. Yumm!\\n\\nNot much more I can say here... other than...ummm Cornucopia!!!\\nAfter receiving a request to connect about my previous negative experience from Kris Rams VP and GM of Islington Chrysler, I accepted the request and provided my number for a phone call to discuss my experience.\\n\\nKris was extremely apologetic after I recapped my experience which a year ago bruised my image of the the dealershi\\np, and was empathetic to the way in which his staff had treated me when purchasing my vehicle in August 2014.\\n\\nI will note that I have decided to update my review based on the dealerships personal approach by which they reached out and dealt with me even long after my initial review. I received no compensation or incentive to do so. I updated from a 2 to a 3 star based on what I deemed an improvement in my view of their customer service\\nVOLCANO BOWLLLLL!! VOL VOL VOL VOLCANOOOOOOO BOWWWWLLLLLLLLLL!!!\\n\\n... is that an earthquake? Nope just another person ordering a massive drink adorned with fire and extra long straws!!\\n\\nWhat an amazing and different night this was and what an incredible way to celebrate your birthday then in Polynesian/Hawaiian style! From the outside this relatively unassuming new Parkdale spot looks respectable and classy - similar to so many other trendy Toronto cocktail bars, then you open the door and BOOM, wall-to-wall tikki-tacky-tiki Kitsch as far as the eye can\\n see. From bamboo to palm leaves, tiki torches and barrels, The Shameful Tiki Room is just that.. a magnificently shameful tiki bar. I love it.\\n\\nIt's the sister location of the already popular Vancouver cocktail bar of the same name, brought to Toronto at just the right time in my opinion (just when cocktails were beginning to get a little too stuffy for their own good). Now one can imbibe and have fun and not worry about how weird you might look with a massive alcohol filled fruit bowl in your lap. Because here everyone is doing it.\\n\\nI'm proud to say our table basically drank the menu. And to be honest the names of some of my favourites were hard enough to say and remember sober, let alone 5-10 in the bag. However I do remember MYSTERY BOOOOWWWWWLL (gong!!!) and of course VOLCANO BOWLLLLL. I'm pretty sure our Uber driver hated me on the way him as it was my favourite thing to bellow every few minutes.\\n\\nWe scored the 8-10 person more private oasis area in the rear of the bar and along \\nside our bevy of booze we also had food! The food here is wonderful for sharing, and I recommend you come here with a group so you can try many thing. Sliders were excellent and the sweet potato fries they came with were just lovely, the crab rangoon - what is this?!!?!? So good, sweet and sticky chicken wings yumm, and more and more.\\n\\nI honestly can't say enough about this place... other than of course\\n\\nVOLCANNOOOO BOWLLLLLLLLLL VOOOOLLLLLCAANNNOOOOOO BOWL\\n\\nThanks for making my birthday extra special STR, I lurve you forever now!\\n\\nEatcrest Out\\nHmmm, I purchased my Jeep Wrangler here back in August and was about to write a fairly average review about my experience, and after reading the comments of others, I feel like I've been duped and to be honest - feel kinda stupid.. played if you will. \\n\\nI'm going to retell my experience and allow you the consumer to make up your own assumptions. The only reason I'm awarding them a star higher than 1 is based on the integrity and service I receiv\", 'actual_label': 29, 'predicted_label': 29}, {'text': 'ed from the gentleman who sold me my vehicle - whom I recently found out left this dealership because of their \"business practices\".\\n\\nI waited a LONG time to make my move up from 2010 Jeep Patriot to 2014 Wrangler, the wrangler has been my dream car for years, and when the time came to make the old trade in and trade up I went to these guys. \\n\\nI was greeted at the door by the gentleman who would eventually sell me my car (whom I\\'ll leave nameless to protect). This guy was from the old school of customer service, asked me my needs, got me coffee, took me in and out of a dozen vehicles and was really low pressure. I appreciated that. Heck he even sent me a hand written card in the mail thanking me for my business! Do people even do that anymore? Amazing.\\n\\nI knew I\\'d be financing my new car and trading in my old one, so when it came time to \"do the numbers\" I had \"the meeting\" with one of the sales managers. He sat me down and instead of playing things straight with me, held a piece of pa\\nper away from my face as if they were poker cards and asked me what I was willing to pay, I told him. He look at the paper, said from what he was looking at he couldn\\'t do that. I figured \\'OK\\' negotiation time... let\\'s dance. Instead of entering into negotiation mode, this slick rick in a fancy suit played games with me like I was guessing numbers, treated me like a child, was insulting to my intelligence. He basically just kept saying - \"I have a number on my paper and I just cannot do what you\\'re saying\". That\\'s fine, but at least tell me what numbers we\\'re talking about so I can make an educated decision. No? Fine...\\n\\nOK.. So I walked away saying I would think about it, when in fact I had decided to go to another set of dealerships. End of story...\\n\\nNot so, a few days later I received a call from a different sales manager, essentially begging me to come back, playing the perfect good cop. And when I expressed my disgust at how I had been treated he played the good cop more and said \\n\"let me work with the numbers and get back to you ASAP.\"\\n\\nTo his credit after several hours, he did finally get back to me with a too good to be true proposition. One good enough to make me give the dealership a second chance. So I returned set to make a great deal. \\n\\nUpon my return everyone was smiles, and slick rick, even stayed far FAR away from me to not sully the process. We began the paper work and then \\'Oopsie\\' guess what? - manager number two comes over and apologizes \"deeply\" for getting the math wrong and in fact the price he quoted was no longer possible. Guess we need to start over again...\\n\\nSuddenly there is a number, one that I assume is the original number, slick rick wouldn\\'t tip his hand to. At least now I had a number to work with - so let\\'s dance part 2. After some painful negotiation we agreed on a price in the UPPER end of my price range and it was time for finance.\\n\\nEnter Mr. Umar, (yeah I\\'ll say his name since he is the finance guy and others have mentioned him).\\n He\\'s the guy that processes your financing and pushes all the extras on you, oil spray, extended warranty, etc, etc, etc. I was prepared to get an extended warranty and I did. But his methods were no kosher in my opinion. I believe the approach he used was... \\n\\n\"so let\\'s look at the jeep, see how thin the doors are, you that will rust up right quick so i mean you\\'d be stupid to not get the oil spray... I mean you look like a smart guy so obviously you\\'re going with that... so moving on\"\\n\\nThere.. that comment right there, lost ya the extra bucks buddy. Sure my jeep might rust in Canadian conditions, but I\\'d sooner drive 140km/h on the highway in -40C weather with a giant rust hole in my door than be spoken to like that! He even argued with me that my mechanic wasn\\'t qualified enough to change my oil when I refused buying my oil changes from them - told me it would void my warranty, and he said it as a threat! Seriously?\\n\\nBut you\\'re right it\\'s my choice and my loss - no skin off your ba\\nck. But still, leave the sleeze where it belongs - on used car lots in the 80\\'s with the guys rocking out of season sport jackets and a greasy toupee. \\n\\nSo in the end... am I happy with my car? Yes.\\nDid I enjoy the process - hell no! \\nDo I feel like I got douped by their bad cop, bad cop sales tactics - Yep!\\nDid I let my \\'want\\' of my dream car cloud my judgement? Ya definitely.\\nWould I recommend shopping at this dealership. Not unless your car breaks down out front.. \\n\\nThere are hundreds of other Chrysler dealerships - shop elsewhere\\nI\\'m starting to REALLY love the junction! The coffee, the restaurants, the food, the stores. What a perfectly wonderful neighbourhood! Having some friends in the area has increased my exploration of this Dundas neighbourhood 10 fold this past month.\\n\\nMy most recent discovery was Littlefish; a tiny breakfast/brunch spot a few doors down from 3030 and Locamotive on the north side of Dundas W. They\\'ve got a couple of the coolest staff working the front of hou', 'actual_label': 29, 'predicted_label': 8}, {'text': 'se and a team of experts in the kitchen.\\n\\nBreakfast/brunch is one thing, but what they\\'re serving up is some next level grub. My brunch mate and I were having a difficult time choosing what to eat and decided to share a couple of items. Our first selection was the \"Jen\\'s choice\" which was a BLT with avocado and 2 fried eggs on top. The second choice was a fattening delicious take on eggs Benedict - their take? Put fresh made hollandaise on top of poached eggs which are sitting on a layer of freshly made pierogies, mushrooms and sauteed onions. Yep, Pierogies and eggs for breakfast! Killer!\\n\\nAside from the eats their latte, bottomless drip coffee and the freshly squeezed orange juice was all tops in my books. \\n\\nOnly drawback is it\\'s a tad more expensive than your average breakfast spot ($37 for all we had) but with quality ingredients and amazing concoctions like they\\'re cooking out the food is worth the price, and the wait!\\n\\nEatcrest Out!\\nThis review came after some great internal deba\\nte. i hymped and I hawed back and forth as to whether or not I award this place 2 or 3 stars after my recent visit here. I refuse to give a half star as 1/2 points are about as satisfying as kissing ones own cousin and seeing as I don\\'t do one I refrain from doing the other... ok off topic there for a moment (this is what happens when you write a review at 12:30AM)\\n\\nI really cannot say anything bad about Hero Certified Burgers. The burgers and toppings are always, ALWAYS, tasty and delicious. Cooked to near perfection and the ability to make unique combinations is always a fav of mine. \\n\\nThis being said, I must warm you all about the terror which is their specialty sandwich menu. The taste remains consistently good but more than 1-2 of these a week and you will for sure be headed to the poor house. THEY BEEZ EXPINSIVE!!!\\n\\nA recent late lunch stop here had me feening for a gourmet grilled chicken sandwich - enter the Italian Deluxe Chicken Sandwich (should have taken a hint that anythin\\ng DELUXE will break ones bank).\\n\\nTopped with goat cheese, grilled peppers and mushrooms, cheese and special sauces all served on a toasted Chiabatta bun, I cannot tell a lie - it was amazing! BUT at $13 for only the sandwich I feel like HCB is going to struggle to make that sale 9/10 times. \\n\\nNo fries and no drink with that order (they would have cost me extra). Not great value.\\n\\nMy only other complaint here was the cleanliness of the establishment. Bathrooms and tables were neglected during the post lunch rush. I\\'ll give them the benefit of the doubt here BUT I will be back HERO BURGER..... and I\\'ll be watching (slanty evil eyes).\\nI was surprised to see that one of my favourite indie coffee shops from Mississauga had opened up a location in Bloor West Village. I\\'d walked/driven by a few times and today finally had an excuse to visit. \\n\\nIt\\'s basically all the elements I thought were amazing from the Mississauga location with improvements in all the areas I wished the other had. Those i\\nmprovements being: more seating, more space, more food options (and more to come as this location will soon be a sit down restaurant and not just a cafe), more vinyl, better wifi and a few electrical outlets to plug into if you\\'re planning to do some remote work like I was today. \\n\\nI spent the better part of the day here enjoying their awesome music selection, a green tea, a fantastic bowl of thai chicken soup and pretty darn good Turkey and Brie cheese sandwich. \\n\\nThe sandwich had a great aioli on it that I couldn\\'t quite place and had been cooked in a panini press. My only issue with it was that they cooked the sandwich with the lettuce inside so it took on a bitter taste and mushy texture - lettuce should be added after as a topping as it requires (and does better with) no heating. \\n\\nOther than the hot lettuce lol, everything here was great. I didn\\'t have a chance to peruse the used vinyl in depth as I was busy but the selection was epic. I could honestly get lost in here all day. \\n\\n\\nThey\\'re still putting some finishing decor touches up and the liquor license application is in the window. Between drinks and the live music I\\'ve heard they have here, I can\\'t wait to come back next!\\nI think it\\'s safe to say I have an addiction, I thought it was pizza, but no, it\\'s burgers. And if my addiction has impacted you in a negative way... TOO BAD, because I\\'m going to get doing what I\\'m doing. \\n\\nEven if I wanted to stop, with a place like Fresh Burger opening up in my hometown I couldn\\'t even if I wanted. Their beef is my cocaine, their fries/poutine are my heroine and their special sauce... A fantastic psychedelic too strong for any man to withstand. \\n\\nNo wonder when:\\n- each burger is hand formed and pressed on the flat top to order\\n- fries are peeled in house, soaked to extract excess starch, blanched once to cook them half way and then fried to finish on order\\n- sauce made in house is the perfect balance of ingredients that it can safely stand on it\\'s own on any burger. \\n\\n', 'actual_label': 29, 'predicted_label': 19}, {'text': 'Little known fact is that Fresh Burger is modeled closely after the legendary California burger chain, In and Out Burger. Having eaten at I\\'nO when in San Francisco I can safely say that they\\'ve perfected the In and Out Burger and concept... And improved upon the original. \\n\\nA burger buddy with me this evening made the observation that the burger was \"almost a fluffy texture.\" An excellent way to describe the melt in your mouth burger, bun and topping combination of their creations. \\n\\nI\\'m thrilled to say that despite the burger renaissance currently occurring in Toronto, the best burger around is being served north of Hwy 7, in Richmond Hill. Don\\'t believe me? Make the trek and you\\'ll see. \\n\\nFresh Burger has accomplished in 4 months what other burger joints can only aspire to and it\\'s burgers are one addiction I\\'m happy to have.\\nWait, Wut? Didn\\'t this place used to be Rock, Wood, Grass? And furthermore, did I just age myself by making that point? I think I did... Le Sigh... I am tres g\\netting old. But (in another dated reference) as Bob Dylan once wrote \"The times, they are a-changing\\'\".\\n\\nIn my entire life, I would never think that a cool-ish brewery would find it\\'s way onto Mercer Street of all the streets in TO. I mean this was (may still be) the height of wanna be bougie, douchey clubbing in all it\\'s scantily clad glory? A brewery in the entertainment district...? Something about fishes being out of water comes to mind.\\n\\nBut I digress, perhaps ol\\'Bob was right? Maybe Mercer, much like the times, is a changing and Mascot Brewery is at the epicenter of this change (fingers crossed). Currently, the main two floors inside are still clubbing... and clubbing hard. Bass that will blow your middle ear out your asshole, and lots of drunk groping and bump\\'n grind (I think the main two floors go by a different name).\\n\\nMascot lays claim, at least this summer, to the rooftop patio! And my oh my they\\'ve changed their look and feel. At first, I thought it was a club wearing a br\\newery\\'s clothing but it\\'s actually a brew-ha-ha! They make their own beer and soon they will actually have the tanks on premise to prove it.\\n\\nThe experience overall was really fun, the beer was tasty and even the food was pretty good overall (it\\'s made out of a food cart that\\'s been lifted onto the roof - legit! \\n\\nI\\'d have happily left this a 4 star. But just prior to leaving for the night it began to rain... EGGS!!! Yes, some jack-off from the condos that overlook the Mascot rooftop started hurling eggs like  it was the Battle of Helm\\'s Deep (pause for you to get gratuitous Lord Of The Rings reference). I got hit 3 times before I could seek cover (and that went for everyone).\\n\\nI was annoyed and asked my server about this and she just shrugged and said, \"it happens\". Cool.\\n\\nSo we left, and bumped into the cops out front and figured we\\'d give the 911 the 411. They did the same thing as the server \"nothing we can do... it happens every weekend\" WOT? (lol, great police work sir, remind me\\n to not pay your salary next year officer cueball).\\n\\nIf this happens every weekend and we\\'re just excepting a good egging like it\\'s passing by traffic, that is where we lose a star guys. If this is an ongoing issue, make patrons aware, put up some signage (or better yet a netting of sorts). And if all else fails, and you\\'re aware, offer to buy those impacted a drink or pay for some dry cleaning.\\n\\nAnywhoo... not bitter about it. I\\'ll still go back but next time, I\\'m bringing a paintball gun and am gonna light that condo up like a Christmas tree if they start (never bring a knife to a gun fight). Be advised. *****\\n\\nEatcrest out\\n\\n************\\n- Just to clarify, because you KNOW someone is going to take from my last sentence something out of context\\n1) Levity. I tend to use extreme funny examples to drive my points home\\n2) Paint Ball... not a real gun. Daddy don\\'t play with guns\\nPurchased Ice here for my 30th birthday several months ago and had a so-so experience overall. My biggest compla\\nint was in the quoting and communication portion of their staff.\\n\\nI requested a quote for a certain amount of cocktail ice (1 inch cubes) perfect for making craft cocktails on their website and received a reasonable quote quickly via email. I placed the order, satisfied with the quality, quantity and price of my order. Apparently, unless you\\'re doing a very large order, you\\'re not getting delivery as they promote on their website. I even offered to pay for the service and they would not budge.\\n\\nI had to make the trek to pick up my order, and despite it being incredibly inconvenient to access their tiny parking lot off of Adelaide with limited parking, I\\'m glad I did because this was where communication lines broke down.\\n\\nI arrived, found parking and provided the staff my order reference number, my bags of ice were brought out and as I double checked it, it turns out I was not provided with cubed ice I requested, in fact it was regular ice, ideal for regular drinks but not what I ordere', 'actual_label': 29, 'predicted_label': 29}, {'text': 'd and especially not ideal for making specialty cocktails.\\n\\nI brought this up and the staff informed me that this was what I ordered, I showed her my email confirmation which stated the type of ice clearly and the quoted price, and the woman blankly looked at me and insisted that what they had prepared was what I had ordered and if I wanted the other ice I would need to pay an additional fee -seriously?\\n\\nI insisted repeatedly but in the end had to pay the difference to get what I had originally asked for and had been quoted on... not a great experience IMHO.\\n\\nThe ice was great quality and made excellent drinks, but the stressful and misleading customer service experience ruined my opinion of this business.\\nBefore the arrival of AYCE sushi chain Aji Sai, finding decent AYCE Sushi options in Aurora were a little difficult to find. This is an predominantly white town where people like their fish battered and fried as opposed to raw and on rice. \\n\\nIt wasn\\'t  long ago that Sushi Kui decided\\n to open it\\'s doors in a most unique venue choice. Nestled in the center of the courtyard of the St. Andrew\\'s Plaza located at the corner of Yonge and Orchard Heights. Entering from Orchard Heights is a rookie move and it will take you 2-3 times to figure out that if you enter one street north of Orchard heights that you have direct access to the restaurants front doors.\\n\\nYou think I\\'m joking but I\\'ve been walking through the courtyard and seen people looking around lost and when I ask what they\\'re looking for... well you know where this is going. \\n\\nIn terms of Sushi, I find this place to be hit or miss but they tend to er more on the side of hit rather than miss. Their rolls are fairly good and aren\\'t overdone with rice. The fish is fresh and cold when it\\'s served and the cuts are always more than fair for AYCE.\\n\\nDefinitely worth checking out if you find yourself caught in Aurora, afraid to venture further north and too lazy to cart yourself back to AYCE sushi heaven in Richmond Hill/\\nMarkham.\\n\\nHot tip:\\nThey offer 10% discount on certain weekdays (Lunch and Dinner) call ahead to find out what days are being offered that week. Winter time it\\'s Mon - Thursday\\n\\nEatcrest Outtie!\\nWho ya gonna call when you need a lunch combo for under $10 on Eglington Avenue West - Yitz\\'s Deli... that\\'s who.\\n\\nWandering the streets when you suddenly realize \"It\\'s as cold as an arctic vortex out here and I\\'m kinda hungry.\" Means that you want warm, comfy food that fills you up and makes you fell all kinds of good. \\n\\nYitz\\'s was nothing to write home to your bubbe about in terms of it\\'s looks and service, basic marks all around, buy that Montreal Style Smoked Meat, Oy Vay!!! Piled high, cooked to perfection and in between two slices of rye bread and a mountain of coleslaw I was one happy fella.\\n\\nBut hold on that sandwich brought a friend, for the $10 lunch special I also got to have a Matzo ball soup that made my mothers meatballs look like raisins (and Mamma U does not make a small ball). T\\nhe matzo ball was super tender and tasted lovely however I wasn\\'t really a fan of the broth. It was overly salty and tasted closer to that green/yellow Lipton Chicken Noodle out of the packet than something freshly made with tender love and care. A good chicken soup should be the equivalent of Jewish Penicillin and cure you of all things that ale you - this soup made me thirsty. \\n\\nThat said, the sandwich more than makes up the difference, so make sure you stop by for one on the go. They also have a whole menu of jewish food faves (knish, etc) so I\\'ll be back to try the rest of this menu on for size.\\n\\nEatcrest Out!\\nShort and sweet, like my visit this week. I\\'m giving them full marks on the following grounds:\\n\\na) Such a breath of fresh air in the longbranch community, this is the new wave that is coming so get used to it stodgy old business owners afraid of change. the young, ambitious business owners are coming with their sustainable, hip, cool ideas.\\n\\nb) Their location is a tad hidden \\nbut a total score once you find it. Very well designed inside with a massive menu which includes smoothies, cold press juices and many other delicious noms - all good for you. I had the Piña, which was kinda like a Piña Colada except healthy and with lots of spinach in it. YUM!\\n\\nc) Price point is right on par with similar businesses such as Booster Juice who claim to be as healthy but substitute concentrated fruit juices in for real fruit!\\n\\nThe FIX and Co is exactly that, my healthy breath of fresh air fix in an otherwise slowly changing longbranch. Check them out, just north of Lakeshore on 30th!\\n\\nEatcrest Out!\\nI\\'ll keep it short and simple here folks. I paid Al Pastor in the Junction a visit during one of the Junction street festivals this summer. For the weekend the business obtained a temporary liquor license so we were fortunate to have the full experience while others may have not.\\n\\nWe ordered the guac and chips (obviously) and I had an excessive amount of Sangria (two of their l', 'actual_label': 29, 'predicted_label': 29}, {'text': \"argest) served in a large mason jar. Once it was time to eat I decided to forego the tacos and ordered their special burrito. \\n\\nThe burrito appeared to be small-ish but it was actually jam packed with filling and stuffed to its full capacity. And it was delicious!\\n\\nLooking forward to coming back and I think if you read some of the earlier nay-sayers reviews, it's time to pay them a visit and make a decision for yourself. I think they're worth the visit!\\n\\nEarcrest Out\\nThis morning my family and I attended the Sunday Brunch at the Manor by Peter and Paul's. I truly love coming here as the drive up to Kettleby is beautiful and the grounds are so well manicured you truly feel like a somebody when you  pull up. \\n\\nThe main hall you walk into for brunch is massive and overlooks the large man made pond on the grounds and the golf course. Wide windows let in not only the scenery BUT also the days sunlight. \\n\\nPrepare yourself when you walk in however because the buffet is truly something to beho\\nld  What a spread! \\n\\n1. Antipasto table with an array of grilled veggies, sea food, salads, cold cuts, cheeses and more\\n\\n2. Breakfast table with freshly made mini Belgian waffles, pancakes, an French toast. Also has all your traditional breakfast staples in  abundance (bacon, sausage, hash browns) but the x factor here is the made to order omelet bar. \\n\\n3. Meat table had a pulled pork baked pie, roast beef carving station, tandoori chicken, rice, roast potato and a made to order pasta station. \\n\\n4. Last but not least is the famous dessert table which you first hit up for some freshly squeezed Orange juice upon arrival. After your meal (or mid way through of that's how you roll) there is a selection and pastries, cookies, cakes and pies that would send even a healthy person into a diabetic coma. Not being a huge dessert person I tend to lean towards the milk chocolate foundation and fresh fruit. Wonderful!\\n\\nFood, scenery and sophisticated ambiance aside my favorite part of brunch is the\\n roaming accordion player who moves from table to table playing a seemingly limitless selection of tunes to ear or by memory. He's a sweet old gent who has a twinkle in his eye and and a warm smile and with a wink makes you feel like family. \\n\\nFor $29.99 a person i am more than Happy to make this place my 100th Yelp Review. Well deserved and highly recommend it as one of best hidden brunch spots in the GTA or other.\\nOhhhkayyyy pisani! Zio Kristiano is gonna tell you a thing or two about this great freakin' place in Woodbridge (aka dudebridge) Bro!\\n\\nBeing a proud EYE-talian (born and raised), I've grown up with a refined palate when it comes to quality eats from my motherland. Is your sauce over cooked? I ain't eating it. Pasta too soft? It's not happening. Cheese from Costco? Get ouutta here Bro! It's safe to say when it comes to Italian eats, I'm kind of a snob.\\n\\nSeveral weeks ago I was at the Savour York Region media launch party and restaurant owner Joe L was present sampling some o\\nf delicious pizza. We got to talking and like any good Italian made sure my plate was loaded with one of every kind of pizza (so much for eating paleo I guess) But I was glad he did, each variety of pizza possessed a flavor combination that made my taste buds tingle. Far and away my favourites were the spicy (diavalo) and the the pepperoni and cheese (classic). They're on the regular menu so if Pizza is your game make sure you try these two!\\n\\nMore recently I stopped by to say hello at their Woodbridge location, and have a quick (healthy) lunch. Joe was there and we chatted - he's a super nice guy, if you see him say hi! I ended up ordering the arugula salad which was done with shaved parmigiano cheese and a light lemon and olive oil dressing AND the grilled calamari which was done in balsamic reduction (I believe) with olives and capers - perfectly cooked!\\n\\nThe decor is gorgeous and the staff were super attentive (which is great to see they've improved now since past reviews). Not to m\\nention the meal was reasonably priced and l left comfortable and full. If you're looking for a private dinner, they have a great private dining room in the basement that comes equipped with anything you might need to conduct a business lunch (TV screen, computer hook up, etc)\\n\\nWhat's even cooler is, if you LOVE the food at this location they've also got a new EXPRESS location that JUST opened up in Richmond Hill so you can get their food quick time on the go!\\n\\nLooking forward to coming back many times again because I mean... THAT'S ITALIAN!\\n\\nEatcrest Out!\\nHave you ever met someone or gone somewhere that made you feel bad about your current life choices (but in a good way). Well that is exactly how I felt after my recent (and first) visit to the mega-sized Whole Foods in Unionville. \\n\\nOn the surface is looks like every other super-sized grocery store complete with: butcher, fish counter, fresh produce, a few aisles of knick-knacks and homewears, a ready made counter and of course the ai\", 'actual_label': 29, 'predicted_label': 29}, {'text': 'sles and aisles of dry grocery goods... with one small exception - Everything is locally sourced, organic, sustainable, with a bevvy of gluten free, vegan, vegetarian options... get what I\\'m saying here. With a McDonalds breakfast in my stomach, I felt shame the moment I walked in as I could sense that everyone was looking at me and judging. \\n\\n... it\\'s as if they could smell the trans-fats and poor life choices coming off of me like fear. So to mask it I quickly bought a freshly squeezed juice made from a mixture of fresh fruits and veggies and started shopping in the organic produce section muttering healthy buzz words so like that of Rick in Season of 1 The Walking Dead where he masks himself in zombie guts to blend in amongst the zombie hoards, I could shop quietly without being judged. \\n\\nMind you this is all in my head. I wasn\\'t being judged, I felt bad about eating poorly when I realized so many healthy options were right at my fingertips. I think I\\'ll try to be a better person an\\nd kinder to my body by paying this spot a visit more often. That said, word of warning, eating this healthy comes at a higher cost so be prepared to open your wallet a little wider for quality grosh!\\n\\nFeeling healthy! Yay!\\nThis place appears to be getting a super bad rap here, and I can\\'t say I understand why? I\\'ve had the PLEASURE, of having breakfast/brunch or just a coffee numerous times and the food has never been anything less than exceptional, the coffee stupendous and the service.. well It\\'s been awhile since I\\'ve been made to feel so at home in a place.\\n\\nHere\\'s what I\\'ve had, and what I recommend you give a try the next time you\\'re in:\\n\\n1) Caramel Latte - Not overly sweet, not too strong, but a great value and delicious\\n\\n2) Breakfast Croissant - Egg, Bacon, Lettuce, Tomato, Mayo, Cheese. Stick it all in a pannini press and take it out once grilled and buttery all over - divine\\n\\n3) Brazilian Omelet - Was a little different than what I\\'m used to for breakfast, but worth a try if \\nyou enjoy Portuguese sausage\\n\\n4) The Steak Sandwich - I seriously don\\'t know where someone else got \"shoe leather\", my sandwich was melt in my mouth amazing. And since when does a\"to go\" sandwich come with sides? People... this is easily a secret steak sandwich YOU NEED to try and YOU NEED to know about! (Remember who told you this)\\n\\nHere\\'s a couple of fun facts:\\n\\n1) Owned and operated by a husband and wife and their family. Nicest people ever! If you visit more than once and you chat with them, they make you feel totally at home and like one of the family - even remembering your names and your order. You don\\'t get service like this anymore\\n\\n2) Their coffee beans are specially roasted (specifically their decaf) for them. The decaf beans they use go through a special Swiss water process to eliminate all traces of caffeine so that you know you\\'re getting 0 g of caffeine in your coffee. The Sbux and 2nd Cups of the world cannot make the same claim as their decaf still retain some caffeine\\n.\\n\\nIgnore the negative comments, and take it from me, this place is a small hidden gem in the Junction worth giving a shot to!\\n\\nEatcrest Out!\\nFor as long as I can remember living in Richmond Hill, the neon signage of 3 coins open kitchen has been lit. Being a surviving staple in the downtown Richmond Hill core for near 60 years it is as much a part of the town as the heritage homes or the World War monument. It\\'s a reminder of our small town routes, and pangs me with nostalgia when I think about everything it has seen change around it in that time.\\n\\nIt had been some time since my last venture in for a quick fried egg sandwich on the go, and being that I hadn\\'t been in a true open kitchen greasy spoon in ages I decided to venture in.\\n\\nI\\'ll be frank about this place - it aint pretty. The floors have seen better days and many of the chairs, look dated (then again that is what they\\'re going for). However, I feel like a quick clean up could really make this place pop once again. The aforeme\\nntioned Neon lights have not been on in ages and the outside white wash finish is getting weather beaten and dirty. BUT don\\'t judge this book by it\\'s cover, like a seasoned veteran this place has character and a story. And I guarantee if you sit still long enough you can hear it.\\n\\nAlright, enough romantic nostalgia\\n\\nI entered and was warmly greeted by the cook and lone waitress and was offered any seat I would like. being an open kitchen purist I sat on a bar stool steps away from the cook and a cup of coffee was immediately place in front of me. Had I been a smoker (and had smoking been allowed indoors today) this would have been the perfect time + place to drink said coffee and enjoy said smoke while reading the days news. \\n\\nI should add that despite the place being busy for 1 server, she was impeccable, she seemed to have an uncanny mental trigger for knowing when my coffee hit half mast and was on me about refills right away. The coffee never even had a chance to cool and I\\'m sure ', 'actual_label': 29, 'predicted_label': 29}, {'text': 's.\\n\\nWe both picked the cheese plate for our dessert course. We received a chunk of good quality cheese with mustard and raspberry sauce, house made bread, crushed pepper and smoked salt.\\n\\nThe portions were just right.\\nNot too much and not too little.\\n\\nThe beverage was included beer and wine were an option.\\n\\nThe $15. Lunch Special made the meal seem like a special occasion.\\n\\nIt just doesn\\'t get any better than this!\\nThis review is only based on take out pizza. \\n\\nNYPD Pizza is a local pizza chain with twelve individually owned locations in the valley. They offer New York Style Pizza made with genuine New York Water.\\n\\nWe took out two pizzas and found some difference between the personal size and the small size. Our personal size pizza was tasty but had a much thicker dough ratio to toppings than the small size.\\n\\nBoth of us were most found of the small size \"Blanca\" (white pizza that was 1/2 tomatoes and half spinach) While the pizza didn\\'t remind me of a genuine New York Slice it was a ve\\nry tasty unique pizza. The crust was thin and chewy and very light. The toppings were delicious and  extra seasoning wasn\\'t needed. The spinach was actually fresh spinach and you could tell it wasn\\'t from frozen. The pizza was so light I could eat three slices without that over filled feeling that I get from some other pizzas.\\n\\nThe pizzas we tried were hot, fresh and tasty.\\n\\nI\\'d recommend the small size over the personal size because of the topping to dough ratio.\\nShort Story- Very Rough Gem\\n                  - Above average Chinese Food - Americanized \\n                  - Specialty might be Cantonese Style Seafood + Live Seafood\\n                  - Service is efficient but not warm or friendly\\n                  - Appears a little tired or run down but scores \"A\" with Health Inspection\\n\\nLong Story-\\n\\nOnce seated I saw the tanks of live seafood and saw a sign for sea bass that I was interested in. The waitress told me that they are all out of sea bass and haven\\'t had it for at least thre\\ne days....This was not a deal breaker for me but my husband got offended by the way she said it like I should have known they were out of sea bass. She said today they have tilapia. I\\'m not a big fan of tilapia so I ordered off the menu.\\n\\nI got the rock cod with vegetables. The Fish was prepared to perfection and was very moist and clean tasting. The sauce was very thin, light and velvety with essence of chicken and was laced with ginger and garlic. This would have been a perfect dish if the bok choy was cleaned properly. I also note the paddle in my rice bowl appeared dirty but when doing a closer inspection I realized the paddle is stained not dirty. This can be easily fixed by using bleach.\\n\\nMy husband had the Szechwan Pork. He thought it was very above average. The pork was moist. The dish was spicy and wasn\\'t too sweet like the way Americanized Chinese Szechwan is. It wasn\\'t the same as the way The Szechwan Restaurant Mui\\'s used to make it but still this dish was very good.\\n\\nThe Y\\nelp rating is very accurate here.\\n\\nI\\'m also feeling a 3.5 based on service, atmosphere and averaging food in.\\n\\nI will round up my rating to 4 stars because the food is what this thing is about.\\nHonestly this was the best hair salon I\\'ve been to in Arizona. This Hair salon isn\\'t the cheapest but it was about HALF the PRICE of Rolf\\'s in Arrowhead and I received a much better treatment than a similar I got at Rolf\\'s. (not saying Rolf\\'s is bad but my experience wasn\\'t the best maybe due to one particular stylist) When I was done all the other women being done at the salon OOHED and Aah at me admiring my hair they were impressed. People do stop me about my hair often and my hair was checked out and searched recently at a certain airport.\\n\\nKandy said she did my highlights in the NEW MODERN WAY not the old fashioned way. Not with foil but painted on ends like hers.\\n\\nHer Prodigy did most of my styling under Kandy\\'s direction so I wasn\\'t sure how to tip correctly so I did wind up tipping extra.\\n ( not a big deal) The Bumble and Bumble products are nice. I think using all of them is too expensive but will shell out for the styling creme since it goes a long way. I was happy and I am not Usually happy with a hair style,that says a lot!.. more than you know.\\nShort Story - NEWLY OPENED Gorgeous Glamorous New American Style Restaurant that may be still finding their stride. On my visit one out of three dishes was delicious and technically great! Another dish was ok....and one dish wasn\\'t ready to be on the menu yet. Our server was attentive and the manager made light conversation and was open to criticism.\\n\\nLonger story - \\n\\nThe Covenant is located in the corner of the Whole Foods Shopping Center and has free valet parking. Inside is very glamorous with chandeliers and artsy mirrors. They have a Charlie Palmer Style Wine Tower in the room and also an open rack of whiskeys on display to wet your whistle.

On my visit the atmosphere was energetic, a bit loud and the air was on the humid side.\\n\\nWe started out by sharing a Melon Feta Salad. The salad was very generous in size. They graciously split the salad in two large bowls. We received a variety of melon, tangy feta, peppery arugula, a little creamy avocado that was dusted with Korean Red Pepper Threads. The salad was more like a fruit cup because it lacked dressing of any kind. I did speak to the manager about this dish and he agreed with me and informed me that the kitchen is coming up with a dressing for this dish that sounds delicious so maybe by tomorrow this dish could be wonderful.\\n\\nFor dinner I wanted to order the fish of the day but I was informed it was already sold out before dinner..............\\n\\nI went with my second choice and picked the chicken dinner. I received a STUNNING CHICKEN DINNER. Super moist flavorful thigh and\\n breast with GORGEOUS Extra Fancy vegetables they smashed creamy fingerling potatoes and crisped them up. It was a great big serving too....They did a chicken dinner really well.\\n\\nMy husband had what they called the Chef's Cheddar Mac. It was pretty good but my husband wished that the dish had more of the really tasty andouille sausage and he also wished the shrimp weren't over cooked.\\n\\nI think things will improve rapidly since the manager has an open ear to the customers.\\n\\nThis is a very nice gorgeous restaurant but since it's newly opened it could be a little hit and miss for now.\\n\\nGreat Potential!\\nThis little bakery and cafe offers Indian Inspired flavored ice creams, regular ice cream, cake pops, cup cakes, coffee and more. It's a lovely sleek looking cafe with modern rich looking features. They offer mostly counter seating and do have two tiny tables.\\n\\nThey do offer you samples of the ice cream to try. I first tried saffron pistachio and the second one lightly ginger seemed better\\n. My husband only sampled what I tried and just ordered the carrot halwa ice cream.\\n\\nThe ginger ice cream had a texture that was light and very unique. The flavor was intensely ginger and was sort of spicy but refreshing. I tried a taste of my husband's carrot halwa flavor ice cream. Both of us didn't care for this one mostly because of the greasy texture.\\n\\nThe girl working the counter was pleasant and efficient and the cafe seemed clean and spotless.\\n\\nMy main reason for the two star rating is that I was there forty minutes after they were open and not one baked good was ready for sale. I wanted to bring home some baked goods and I live far from here and I'm not always in this area so I doubt I'll be back.\\n\\nThis place has potential to be a gem but you have to get there when they are ready to be open for business.\\nI am just happy to have a nice salad for lunch. The Herb Peppered Salmon Salad was tasty and a not too heavy meal for lunch although it appeared to be large enough to feed a f\\namily. The Salmon was prepared about medium and was a good portion. My salad had marinated chopped tomatoes and grape tomatoes (I thought that was odd) red onions cucumbers and what I think were bottled red roasted peppers because I didn't taste can but they didn't seem fresh roasted either. The salad overall tasted good and came with a piece of herbed flat bread to fill you up.\\n\\nMy husband had the Milano Salad it was like an Italian Hoagie in a salad, overall he liked it but thought it's dressing didn't have enough zing (vinegar).\\n\\nThey have many interesting sounding things on the menu and I will most likely visit again because they serve lunch NOT just Brunch on Saturday (Sunday I don't know)\\n\\nI noticed they might? have a dog friendly patio because I saw a big container of dog treats.\\n\\nService was very friendly and efficient.\\n\\nBut-\\n\\nParking is very limited and you might have to park on the street or a nearby lot.\\n\\nI do NOTE-\\n\\nI would never use the ketchup here because they keep it ou\\ntside on the patio in containers you can't see threw. Ketchup once opened does start to spoil when it is not refrigerated. In a restaurant the ketchup isn't handled the same way as in your home. I've seen many ketchup bottles burst from going bad in an indoor environment. Outdoors in AZ heat must be worst.\\n\\nOverall a nice place but I have to add my two cents about the ketchup.\\nThis Chinese is the best that I've found in this area and I have close to a half dozen places that are closer but non of them have make food so tasty flavorful and fresh like New Asian Kitchen always does. \\n\\nLast night I had my favorite the Szechuan Chicken it was great like it always is. My husband had a cup of House Wor Wonton Soup and the Kung Pao Delight.\\n\\nThe bill including two drinks was only ONLY $22.85 before tax and tip.\\n\\nThey remodeled and are modern and clean looking.\\nWo Fat offers your usual Chinese Favorites and some Hawaiian Chinese Inspired Dishes that you won't find anywhere else nearby. \\n\\nWe star\", 'actual_label': 30, 'predicted_label': 30}, {'text': 'ted with the crispy au au chee (Crispy pork dumplings).

Once you peel off the chicken skin and remove it from the bone THIS IS KILLER GOOD CHICKEN! Deeply flavorful and moist. Not over seasoned the chicken flavor comes threw, just DELICIOUS. The portion they gave me was very large and I had enough leftover for two large dinners.\\n\\nI wanted to try the hard to come by CAKE NOODLES. My server spoke English but I had a hard time understanding her and I accidentally ordered a meal of chicken cake noodles instead of just adding on cake noodles for $1.25. Anyway the cake noodles are really delicious. They remind me of ramen but are more firm and have much more flavor like wheat. The noodles seemed slightly pan fried with crisp ends and even were more delicious on the crispy ends. What ever kind of chicken dish she ordered for\\n me was also delicious. It was chunks of flavorful tender yummy dark meat chicken.\\n\\nMy husband had Szechuan Shrimp.

They were a little sweet, a little spicy and seemed very light in texture almost like eating a rice cake. The cucumber chutney was light and refreshing and went well with the corn fritters. I thought the fritters were very unique and never had anything like them before.\\n\\nI enjoyed the 24K, it was really delicious Thai Pumpkin, Two kinds of eggplant including Thai, fresh green beans in spicy green curry. I added chicken to the dish and it was prepared well. I thought this dish was delicious but would have been much better if they just added a little fresh basil. \\n\\nMy husband really enjoyed the Sliced WILD BOAR in HOT red chili sauce. \\n\\nService was very good. We had two servers that both checked on us several times and also offered refills before we even needed them.\\n\\nTasty food but I would ask for some fresh basil next time.\\n\\n3.75 stars\\nI noticed slight changes since my last visits. The website has been removed and I saw a different person who maybe was in charge\\n?\\n\\nThey didn\\'t bring us all the sauces with our spring rolls this time but my main reason for lowering them a star is because the chicken in my meal was terribly dry.\\n\\nI remember the lemongrass chicken was wonderfully tasty here so I thought I\\'d get it again. It still was tasty but I have no idea how they made the chicken so dry. I usually give places two stars for extra dry chicken because that shouldn\\'t be done when you go out to eat in my opinion. It\\'s so easy to cook chicken when you get very dry chicken it\\'s disappointing.\\n\\nThe chicken in the spring roll was dark meat and was OK but not like fresh made good.\\n\\nMaybe it was just a slightly off day? don\\'t know?\\n\\nSlight update, New Website\\nLine Thai proudly displays their large pile of grade \"A\" health inspection reports in the lobby.\\n\\nThe owner was very thoughtful and picked chairs for elderly or handicapped people because of the wheels on the chair legs for ease of movement. Booths are also available.\\n\\nThey started us off with a cup\\n of complimentary egg noodle soup. The soup seemed house made and good but did have some frozen vegetables in it\\n\\nI ordered the Phad Eggplant with Chicken. I thought the sauce was very good and I liked the fresh vegetables in it. The white meat chicken was sort of dry and didn\\'t seem developed with flavor but OK and passable. They use jalapeno peppers here and I know it\\'s a substitute for Thai banana peppers but I would have preferred Thai Birdseye chills. The medium hot was a perfect heat level I thought.\\n\\nMy companion had one of the shrimp dishes. He ordered it hot and said it was just slightly hotter than mine and thought the heat was mostly from the jalapeno peppers. He said the shrimp were cooked perfect and he thought the sauce was also very good.\\n\\nService was extremely courteous and timely.\\n\\nI will be back sometime for lunch because Satara no longer is open for lunch on the weekends and I think Line Thai is the next closest Thai.\\n\\nBetter than other Thai places I gave three stars', 'actual_label': 30, 'predicted_label': 30}, {'text': \" to but not quite as good as Thai Places I gave four stars to.\\n\\nA very solid three stars.\\n\\n3.5 stars\\nThis is a FUN budget eatery that offers a variety of different foods and some adult booze in airplane bottles and beer. They offer, burgers, Chicago Sandwiches and hot dogs, breakfast sandwiches, Gyros, Mexican Food and MORE!\\n\\nI tried a pastrami topped single burger with fries. The burger is unique. It's a fresh made squashed thin on the grill kind of burger. The pastrami accented the beef well and gave it more flavor. I liked that this isn't a really big burger. It's fast food sized and priced and MUCH BETTER than a fast food burger. The fries were very fresh and crisp and seemed to be lightly battered.\\n\\nMy husband had the Ortega burger that had a roasted green chili and sautéed onions with onion rings. They have a sign stating the onion rings are home made. The onions were very similar to burger king onions rings but better.\\n\\nBetter than Fast Food and only Fast Food Priced.\\n\\n3.5 Stars\\n\\nChica is located on Restaurant Row in the Venetian just off the casino floor.

It differed from quesadillas you get at most places. It was more elevated. Besides mushrooms it contained Huitlacoche, Oaxacan Cheese, Jalapeño Pesto and Pickled Onion. They served it in a tower that was held together with Guacamole. It was the most interesting detailed quesadilla I ever had.\\n\\nI had the 1/2 Marinated Meyer Lemon Rotisserie Chicken. The Chicken was the moistest Rotisserie Chicken I ever had. Even the breast almost fell apart. The chicken was very flavorful and was delicious! Off to the side was Purple\\n Peruvian Potato Salad with Palm. It was very spicy with Jalapeño but also was creamy to cut the heat. It also was herbaceous with Cilantro.\\n\\nMy husband enjoyed the Porchetta with crisp Yucca Hash with Brussels Sprouts with Pearl Onions and Escabeche.\\n\\nThey did send samples of some of the other foods they offer our way. (and man they were awesome) I was told it was because I mentioned that I was a fan of Chef Lorena Garcia. I did notice other tables didn't get the samples we got.\\n\\nEveryone working there was very friendly with us and treated us like we already were regulars.\\n\\nWe enjoyed dining at Chica Very Much!\\nBeing as nice as possible I have to say this is a below average Chinese Restaurant so I am rounding it UP to two stars  ONLY because of the extreme cleanliness and the attentive server .\\n\\nI was going to order the Szechuan Chicken but the server informed me that they make it with fried chicken so I thought I wouldn't like it and ordered Vegetable Chop Suey instead . I couldn't w\\natch them cook but heard almost no noise from the kitchen and my meal was out within a couple minutes  (maybe two?) . It seemed like the vegetables and rice were precooked and someone poured heated chicken stock over it . I am trying  NOT to to be mean but It seemed and tasted liked microwave cookery  . Most of the vegetables didn't seem like fresh ones like the awful canned bamboo shoots and the pre cut very possibly bagged broccoli , potato chip shape cut carrots with snow pea mix , but two fresh vegetables were the button mushroom and cabbage . Even the steamed ( steamed ?) rice didn't taste good , each rice grain was sort of dried out . (maybe old?)\\n\\nMy husband had one of the Beef Lunches that are mostly priced at $4.50 or $4.95 . It came out two or three minutes after mine and had the same vegetables but in a brown sauce that tasted very strong of uncooked beef base . The lunch menu includes soup , won ton  , and egg roll , The soup was very thick with too much corn starch and the\\n won ton was EMPTY . \\n\\nMaybe someone new was trying to cook that day .\\nSo far This is the only True Neapolitan Certified pizza that I tried that taste good to me. This weekend we tried the famous Bianca D.O.C. pizza (white pizza $12) and the Regina Margherita D.O.C. ($14) The margherita was tasty flavorful and very light,the dough was wet but did have some structure and was seasoned perfect so it wasn't necessary to add a thing. I did find the bufala cheese too wet for this pie and prefer the Margherita D.O.C.  (difference is house made mozzarella and a $4 savings $10)\\nThe Bianca pie was much sturdier and also not wet. For my taste the pie is very garlicky and for my taste next time I will be adding the onion option for $2 more to balance the flavors more.\\n\\nNext to us the people were having the home made cheese cake and it looked so light and fluffy I got a piece to try the next day.

This is a small restaurant with a very limited menu that specializes with cage free organic eggs. This location is very busy but the line moves very fast. \\n\\nI tried the Fairfax Sandwich. It's a locally made brioche bun that's stuffed with loose scrambled eggs, caramelized onion, chives, cheddar cheese and sriracha mayo. It's a very SQUISHY SOFT sandwich....it's super squishy with tons of squishy loose egg. I would never order it again but I know it's just me...I didn't think the brioche was the best because it was white inside.....brioche is a rich eggy buttery bread. I also thought the cheddar used wasn't the best. Really the only flavor it had was from the sriracha mayo....\\n\\nMy husband tried the Bacon and Cheese. His sandwich was made with lots of crisp bacon, the cheddar slice, an over medium e\\ngg and chipotle ketchup. I asked him how his sandwich was and he said squishy. I said your sandwich isn't as squishy as mine.....Mine is super squishy.\\n\\nGive them a chance if you favor squishy sandwiches.\\nInteresting quaint and sort of shabby chic urban vibe .\\n\\nAt the moment this is a TEENY tiny place with maybe 6 tables and the tables are mostly two seaters but they will be expanding next door . I do find the menus are somewhat limited so check first on line is the menu suits you and parking is on street or the free garage almost next door . Also I need to add the bench along the half of restaurant sits you up above the table oddly and only one 2 top is without bench at this time .\\n\\nWe stopped in for lunch and our server was very warm and informative .\\n\\nFor lunch we started with very fresh salads made of spinach , just the right amount of feta cheese , plump fresh blackberries , candied nuts with raspberry dressing .\\n\\nWe tried the panini with blackberries , goat cheese , fig on home m\\nade bread (like focaccia) . The panini had a nice light crunch and you get a taste that is was salted , the cheese wasn't too tangy it was creamy so it was a better goat cheese this sandwich sounds sweet but it wasn't so it was good .\\n\\nWe also had the special gnocchi with pancetta in a smoked cheddar cream sauce , this was a perfect lunch portion and it was seasoned nicely .\\nfor two drinks ,two lunch salads , two meals the bill with tax before tip was approx $21.  we liked it we'd go back but I will pick the chair again\\nWorth a try!\\n\\nNice and New Pretty and Modern with a Bar and reasonably priced wine and beer .\\n\\nI never had Black Pepper Fish at a Chinese Restaurant so I decided to give it a try and it came out piping hot ( temperature ) with green peppers and onions and mushrooms . The fish ( I think Tilapia ) was nice and moist and light and this dish is listed on the menu as spicy but it was  mild in an easy to eat light brown sauce that had the black pepper taste in the back-round \\n. I liked that you have the option to have brown rice for a fifty cent upgrade charge so I did .\\n\\nMy husband tried the Szechwan Pork it also had a nice vegetable to meat ratio and also the sauce is very light and more mildly flavored than other places we had Szechwan at .\\n\\nThey offer some dishes I haven't seen elsewhere and I didn't have the Kung Pao or the Orange Chicken but the people who sat behind us did and it looked very good .\\n\\nOur food came out fast and together , all the servers were pleasant .\\n\\nThree stars is a Very High Rating for Chinese in this Area most I feel are two stars .\\nI received a coupon to come in and try them because they were open. We were looking forward to trying this mid eastern style place. I saw the big banners saying they were open. We walked in and were Thrown Out at approximately 5:30 because they reserved the place for a party. Not a soul was there and they wouldn't even let us sit in the bar. My first impression wasn't a good one. The woman asked us t\\no come back tomorrow. If they put a note on the door I would be more understanding. I hope they let YOU in when you make the trip.\\nThe sushi was fresh and was seasoned under the fish and didn't fall apart when handling.\\n\\n The Bento Box C ($12.95) comes with miso soup and is large enough to feed an army.

The scallion b\\nroth sure didn\\'t look like much but it sure was additive and you just needed to eat it.  Both meals really were scrumptious and it will be hard to order something else now.

My husband had two scoops and had regular chocolate and a caramel flavor and those were also great.\\n\\nThey also have a nicely furnished dinning room with comfortable booths and complimentary water.\\n\\nYou should read the story about this family owned business on the Mighty Moo Website and then plan a trip to have some GREAT Ice Cream!\\n\\nSlight update - since my review they got a sign above the shop. Every visit since has been great ice Cream.\\nThis is t\\nhe Whole Foods version of a Dog Supermarket. They specialize in \"Natural\" , \"Organic and \"Holistic\"  Dog Foods. It\\'s not cheap to shop here just like Whole Foods (whole pay check) but that is because your buying  specialized , less ingredient , natural items that cost more. \\n  \\nThe salesperson they had on asked me what I was looking for and showed me several options. He was extremely knowledgeable about all the ingredients in the packages and explained why some were better than others. \\n\\nThey do dog dental cleaning here for $150.00 with no sedation. I haven\\'t had my dog\\'s teeth done here so I can\\'t say if it\\'s good or not but I can tell you that is a nothing to bark at price for dog teeth cleaning. \\n\\nDog rescues set up here on the weekends.\\n\\nThey are conveniently near to AJ\\'s where you can buy $40.00 a pound halibut and $40.00 a pound mushrooms.\\n\\nI based my 4 stars rating on comparing to another smaller similar dog food store in the area that offers much less at similar prices.\\nShort S\\ntory\\n\\nTwo of the pastas we tried were very thick and heavy with a paste like texture and flavors were disappointing.\\n\\nLong story\\n\\nWe were excited to try this place again after reading all the great new reviews. We were welcomed nicely by the hostess and our servers were very cordial and efficient and we were surprised by a tasty amushe bouche of  olive oiled crustini with a light spreading of cheese.\\n\\nWe had a hard time deciding on what to order because really only one traditional type dinner plate was on the menu so we ordered a cheese plate while we took some time to decide. We received delicious crusty bread with high quality olive oil and the cheese plate adorned with very good accompaniments. \\n\\nWe had the pasta fagioli soup. This variation of soup was made with dark beans and seemed to not include the usual seasonings and vegetables such as tomato, celery and onion and the stock. The soup seemed extremely rustic and mostly was just  cooked beans. The pasta in it looked like rolled', 'actual_label': 30, 'predicted_label': 27}, {'text': ' by hand orecchiette, each one was very heavy and thick regular flour pasta that had a paste like texture.\\n\\nThe peach and arugula salad was very good and large. \\n\\nWe ordered the one dinner plate of the evening that included roasted chicken legs and thighs, Shriner\\'s sausage, cold potato salad and pickles. The chicken was OK, The sausage was a little over grilled. The potato salad wasn\\'t delicious.\\n\\nWe also ordered the eggplant strozzapreti also know as priest choker pasta. Again just like the pasta from the soup this pasta was also a hand rolled regular flour pasta but the shape of strozzapreti is an elongated cavatelli shape. Each piece of pasta was approximately the size and heaviness and thickness as a solid green bean. After I ate one I really didn\\'t feel up to any more. I did pick the vegetables out and ate them.\\n\\nI thought even with improvements this visit was a step down.\\n\\n If we made different selections we might have had a more positive experience.\\nTHE VERY BEST MACARONS I HAV\\nE EVER TASTED. They were MIND BLOWING CRAZY GOOD! Slap your Momma. Go to Church CRAZY GOOD!  Little bite sized wonders of not the ordinary flavors. I LOVED THE Savory Thai Curry Macarons, Tikka Masala macarons, and Rosemary and Cheve Macarons. I was told soon Whole Foods will carry them and I was told AJ\\'s carries them. I have never tasted a French Macaron that was so transforming as these from Aunt Abby before!\\n\\nSmoke a cigarette good even if you don\\'t smoke good!\\n\\nReally REALLY good!\\nYardbird Southern Table & Bar is located on Restaurant Row in the Venetian Hotel/Casino and Shops on the Las Vegas Strip. This is a casual restaurant that serves Southern American Foods. \\n\\nWe started with the Deviled Eggs topped with Trout Roe. The eggs were creamy and very flavorful with Chives and Dill. The eggs were very flavorful and delicious!\\n\\nI also got to try a little of the Black Angus Burnt Ends and Tator Tots. The Burnt Ends were caramelized and were full of flavor, tender and meaty. They were\\n served over blue cheese fondue and were topped with pickled peppers that were sweet and spicy. The flavors going on in this dish were incredible. This dish had all kinds of things going on.\\n\\nI had to try the Signature Dish...The Chicken \"N\" Waffles \"N\" Watermelon. The chicken is quality chicken that\\'s marinated for about 27 hours. This was the best chicken and waffles I ever tried anywhere. The Chicken was so juicy and so flavorful. The honey hot sauce was an added bonus to the chicken. The Cheddar waffles were also so good but went into hyper-yumminess  with the bourbon maple sauce. So good! Watermelon was slightly seasoned and was very refreshing and seemed to lighten up a heavy meal. I do note the Chicken and waffles is a very large plate and could only eat half. They gave me a very large 1/2 chicken that was excellent.\\n\\nMy husband had to try the Peppered Gnocchi Pot Pie. I have to say the gnocchi in the pot pie were excellent with the correct texture. They also were delicious with\\n lots of mushrooms and a sage gravy kind of sauce. The dish was topped with a yummy biscuit.\\n\\nThe service was really attentive and very efficient.\\n\\nEverything we tried was scrumptious! The people working there treated us like VIPs!\\nThis place is a little different than the over half dozen fast casual Mexican style eateries we have to choose from in this area . Salsa Blanca serves your meal on real plates and you sit in a nice dining room so it has the feel of a sit down eatery and this place has delivery service .\\n\\nAs for the food we find it somewhat average and for the most part what we\\'d expect for this kind of place .\\n\\nI had the Chicken Taco Salad the meal was served on a large oval plate (not a taco shell? taco salad?) but on the up side the peppers and onions were sauteed not raw so it was more like a fajita salad so I guess that is an upgrade . I also tried a side of guacamole ,it seemed to be made with fresh avocado but it had sour cream mixed into it so for me it wasn\\'t the bes\\nt but it also wasn\\'t the worst either (I really hate when guacamole is frozen or made with frozen avocado) I confess I was not a fan of the seasoning on this particular chicken in my salad but they offer others .\\n\\nMy husband had a combination plate of three things with rice and beans . This place fresh fries your taco so it is one better for tacos than some places that use the shell out of a box . The chicken in his enchilada looked like white meat shredded he thought his meal was OK . I might also need to note we were checked on several times by many different people....so I can say service is stellar .\\n\\nWe have many similar restaurants in this area and Each one is unique and each one does at least one thing better than the others . For a low cost fast casual meal out it\\'s OK .\\nMy last few experiences were excellent here when this place was formally known as Italian Restaurant. Now this restaurant has been split into two restaurants and one half is Pizzeria Bianco and the other half i', 'actual_label': 30, 'predicted_label': 30}, {'text': \"s Trattoria Bianco. The two conjoined restaurants also have different hours of operation. \\n\\nWe decided to try the appetizer special of the evening it was Arancini. They  were fresh and hot and served over arugula but fell apart and crumbled when you tried to eat them and they lacked seasoning and flavor. These arancinis weren't filled but were made of risotto with a few tiny pieces of mushrooms in the rice mixture. They presented us with four and they were $16.00.  \\n\\nThe market salad sounded good so we split one of them. It came out slightly different than our waiter described but was still OK. We received watermelon and cucumber with some fresh herbs, oil and seasoning. I'm not going to nickel and dime the server because he told me purple basil and accidentally said some kind of cheese. But they DID come out at the same time as the Arancini and it was problematic at the table because of lack of room.\\n\\nWe both went with Fresh House Made Pasta Dishes.\\n\\nMy husband tried the Beef Bolognes\\ne Pappardelle. The Pasta was well made with some kind of whole wheat. The sauce was very basic and was made from canned Bianco Tomatoes and some ground beef.\\n\\nI tried the Swiss Chard Lasagna. I imagined a nice piece with yummy sautéed Swiss Chard and maybe a layer of the pretty colorful stems used in an interesting way with layers of oozy melted cheese and fresh seasonings. But alas I was dreaming and received a very dense Brick of pasta and dry cheese. The Swiss Chard was blended into the pasta and that still could be good but it was just pasta and very dry cheese. I don't mean to rant but my plate had sauce on one side and the other side was just water.\\n\\nI KNOW The Chef would be very upset if he knew what I was served and that is the only reason I didn't rate this restaurant at two stars.\\n\\nI KNOW the food would have been better if the Owner was supervising as I noticed the food is always EXCELLENT when he is on site. There fore this was an unfortunate Off Night.\\n\\nThis might not be he\\nlpful but it is very Honest.\\nThey Offer Excellent Food at times but have off nights at times.\\n\\n2.5 Stars\\nTokyo Lobby serves up the highest quality sushi in this immediate area. I can't eat poor or mediocre sushi and can taste the difference. Since my favorite sushi place changed hands I haven't found edible tuna in the immediate area until my return to Tokyo Lobby. For $2.00 you can order real wasabi sauce here and you can request the Fish Collar that they call Jaw here. I did find that the service was a little hit and miss as the one server never gave me my wasabi but I was able to get it from the other server and in the end I left very happy.\\n\\nBest sushi in the immediate area that I know of.\\nThe Bourbon Cellar is a small strip mall restaurant that specializes by day in house ground gourmet burgers and Chef Crafted Sandwiches. By night they are a Steak and Seafood Restaurant. By day or night you can find a large collection of Bourbon here and several of the dishes they offer are laced\\n with Bourbon.\\n\\nMy review is only based on one lunch visit.\\n\\nWe both decided to try a Ground In House *PRIME* Filet Burger on Apple Cider Egg Buns. Each Burger was topped with a WASABI Deviled Egg topped with a Bourbon Cherry......So yummy and delicious.....WOW! I do have to say the burgers really were amazing with great flavor and lots of juice. Just delicious!  That was the good....I hate to to mention a few things but there are a few reasons why this AMAZING burger of the highest quality and extra bling wasn't 5 stars. Each burger was packed with an enormous amount of mixed greens..So much greens that when you took a bit the burgers exploded just like those toy snake in a can things. Actually everything in my burger popped out...I also think a crunchy lettuce might be better in a burger...But the other main reason was the requested degree of doneness wasn't exactly accurate. I request medium and my burger was a little past medium....not a big deal to me because it was close and stil\\nl delicious but my husband requested medium rare and got medium well. That one is a big difference. Our waiter was great and did offer to get another burger and he also did apologies for the chef....\\n\\nThe food we tried was VERY GOOD and CERTAINLY way above average.....Almost Excellent!\\nThe food is OK but I did find they have a very heavy hand with sour flavors here. They give you three sauces with your chips. One is smokey, another is spicy and the green one was painfully sour. I went with the lunch special that was a halibut Torta. I thought it was nice that I could have spicy watermelon instead of fries. The watermelon was marinated in too much sour lime juice and was very painful to eat. The torta was OK but had a small amount of fish compared to the very large roll. My husband had the lunch burrito that was filled with chicken rice and black beans. He said it was OK because the chicken was moist but could have used some sauce in it.\\n\\nOK food, it will do.\\nThis place is a BBQ Bistro,\", 'actual_label': 30, 'predicted_label': 30}, {'text': \" Gift Shop, Wine Store, Bake Shop, Gas Station, Car Wash and MORE located very close to West World.\\n\\nWe didn't try out the car wash yet but stopped in to try some BBQ.\\n\\nAn Enthusiastic Cashier took our order, handed us a number, and we sat ourselves in the interesting Gift Shop surrounded by all kinds of trinkets, antiques and other goods.\\n\\nAlmost as soon as I sit down our platters got ran to us.\\n\\nI received my half Brisket Sandwich with my half Bistro Salad. The first thing I sample is a piece of the Brisket. It was delicious in flavor but was barely warm and very dry. I break off a piece for my husband to try and he said wow is that dry. I never had brisket this  dry before. My salad was fresh but the blue cheese dressing was very thin without chunks of cheese in it. I do note cheese was on the salad.\\n\\nBy the reviews I'm certain they are usually better.\\n\\n Unless most people like dry Brisket?\\nI'm not sure if I'd give four stars for dinner because I only had lunch here but lunch  reall\\ny was ABOVE AVERAGE FOR SURE! We ordered two sandwiches that were well crafted, had some above average ingredients and just where something special that you don't get at too many other places.\\n\\nI had what they called a tea sandwich. It's not what I think a tea sandwich is but whatever it was it was darn good. It was made of house cured salmon that was prepared very nice and wasn't fishy at all and more like butter in your mouth. The pickled cucumber radish salad with sprouts cut the richness of the fish and marscarpone cheese. They didn't use cheap common radishes but pretty heirloom ones.The bread was very fresh and was toasted absolutely perfect. This sandwich was very well crafted.\\n\\nMy husband had the short rib sandwich. The meat was developed with flavor and cooked down still being rich. They used spinach, heirloom tomatoes and those  pickled cherry peppers that are a REAL TREAT to find in Arizona. The short rib sandwich came with fries.\\n\\nBoth sandwiches really were very good but i\\nf I can be knit picky I thought both were a bit heavy on the bread to filling ratio. I ate the tea sandwich open faced. I thought it was enough food but it would have been nice if the tea sandwich came with something like a chunk of fruit.\\n\\nVery nice comfortable patio. \\n\\nVery nice treat for lunch!\\nThe food is hand crafted and all good but in the end I left underwhelmed.\\n\\nThe appetizers are small so two people might try two. (think piece of toast size)\\n\\nWe tried the fennel orange salad with shrimp ($13)  and the cheese plate ($6) . The cheese plate was a high quality peppered eating cheese with what I think was Italian Imported Cherries and Marcona Almonds, bread was not included with the cheese plate so we ordered bread ($2) . The shrimp were well prepared and flavorful however the fennel salad was fresh but very bland and lacked the taste of fennel but did present  well with the use of blood oranges. \\n\\nThree tiny fried sage leaves adorned the 9 small butternut squash raviolis and they\\n were in a browned butter ($14) . The raviolis were seasoned nice and prepared al dente . Potato gnocchi were very light and garnished with a small amount of the famous mozzarella ($15) Two regular size meatballs were added ($6) ((ouch!)) The meatballs were good but ..........\\n\\nI can't say anything was wrong with the food it was all good but left feeling like something was missing.\\n\\nCommunity tables are by the wall. One couple was at one and then another couple with two toddlers joined them.\\nShort Story\\n\\nSmall, not fancy, cash only, no restroom or hand cleaning station. Chicago Style Dogs and Food.  Tasty Italian Beef Sandwiches and hand cut Fries. Low Prices BIG Portions. FAST!\\n\\nLonger Story\\n\\nDazzo's Dog House appears to be a much loved place of Glendale for Chicago Style Vienna Beef Dogs and other foods. They've been around for decades and I witnessed customers sharing stories about Dazzo's here. The Tiny casual restaurant also is decorated with an assortment of memorabilia and fun a\\nntiques including an autographed Alice Cooper Guitar. We placed our order and sat ourselves near the flashing traffic light. Within a minute or two our order was called. \\n\\nI tried the Italian Beef with Giardiniera. The beef was very tender and very developed with flavor. The bread was a sponge that was soaked with all that beefy goodness and the spicy vegetable topping just made the sandwich pop in my mouth in all the right places. The sandwich is very large and comes with a foil liner so you can bring some home for a snack later if you want.\\n\\nMy husband ordered far more food than he could eat but wanted to try The Fire Dog and the combo sandwich. He liked the dog and the combo sandwich but the dog and sausage come deep-fried slightly more well done than he likes so he would stick with Italian Beef next time. Fries come with all the hotdogs and they are made fresh hand cut in house. The fries were tasty and good.\\n\\nThey make Home Made Italian Water ice! I don't know of anyplace else on \", 'actual_label': 30, 'predicted_label': 30}, {'text': 'the westside offers that! The Water Ice is a Creamy kind of style I\\'m not familiar with perhaps it\\'s a Chicago Style? Honestly I didn\\'t care for the water ice but that\\'s just me and I\\'m not holding that against them.\\n\\nCurrently a grade \"A\" Maricopa Sign is posted by ordering station.\\n\\n3.5 Stars\\nFat Ox is an upscale restaurant that serves modern Italian Food. The atmosphere is energetic and very loud. The lighting is very dim...for me...too dark. I didn\\'t actually see my food until I looked at my photos I took. Most of the time I had no idea what I was putting in my mouth. Sometimes it turned out to be a good thing and with my dinner it WASN\\'T a good thing. You will read about THAT latter.\\n\\nThis restaurant offers many small plates of starters and interesting hand made pastas. Our server recommended that we order a starter, THREE pastas (because they are small tastings) and dinners. \\n\\nI have to say the Charred Taleggio was very good. I couldn\\'t see the pomegranate  seeds on it but I felt\\n them pop in my mouth. This dish was balanced, interesting and tasted great.\\n\\nThe Casoncelli Butternut Squash Stuffed Pasta was AMAZING and by far my favorite dish of the evening. It was a very small portion. It was like eating just three stuffed rigatonis but the Casoncelli was so full of great flavors and texture. The pasta was so perfect I could have eaten this whole plate myself.\\n\\nAt this point I was very pleased with the food I was served and thought this could still be a five star experience.\\n\\nMy expectations were very high and I only ordered the Chicken because I\\'ve been to the Chef\\'s other restaurant Zinc Bistro and was served maybe the very BEST CHICKEN in Metro Phoenix there so I was expecting something that compared.\\n\\nOur dinners arrive and take my first taste. I note again it\\'s very dark and hard to see what I\\'m digging into. I got some chicken with Rubbery Soft Chicken Skin Covered in a Tangy but tasty sauce. I have to be honest and I tell it like it is. IT WAS LIKE PLAYIN\\nG MURDER IN THE DARK WITH THE CHICKEN. For me it was too difficult to navigate threw the rubbery skin and bones in the dark. I accidentally swallowed a pile of fennel I had no idea was there. I didn\\'t even know until I looked at the photos I took that my plate had radishes on it.\\n\\nMy husband had the Skirt Steak. I tried a piece and to be honest I don\\'t remember what it tasted like. It wasn\\'t very memorable. My husband complained to me that the food wasn\\'t hot and was only warm. He said his favorite part of his plate was the green part of the roasted carrot. He said the carrot top was the tastiest part.\\n\\nMy waitress seemed nice and tried to be very helpful but neglected to tell me that my plate came with polenta. I didn\\'t think my meal came with anything but charcoal red peppers that the menu states. (P.S. Chicken was NOT over charcoal red peppers,((opening hiccup or menu typo)) So I ordered an extra side that I wouldn\\'t have ordered. Not a big deal but it is the truth.\\n\\nMaybe because I\\n couldn\\'t see the polenta it didn\\'t taste like polenta to me. Or maybe it contained too many add ins. I don\\'t know. It was tasty and good but the base of it tasted more like farina and not corn.\\n\\nThe Calabrian Roasted Cauliflower might have been missing the Calabrian Chili unless it was powdered but was ok. \\n\\nIn short I thought the pre-dinner courses of Charred Taleggio and the pasta dish of Casoncelli was excellent. Dinners weren\\'t bad but didn\\'t compare to the previous dishes. Service was good. Atmosphere would be better if it wasn\\'t so loud or so dark. They have interesting lighting fixtures all over the restaurant and the decor is eye pleasing.\\n\\nI note that at the time of this review (12-4-16) this is a newly opened restaurant and they may be still be in the growing stage figuring things out.\\nBiryani and Bites is part of Peacock Indian Restaurants. This location is difficult to view from the road because another business in the strip mall is blocking the view. The menu lacks descri\\nptions so if you are not familiar with Indian Cuisine you will have a hard time navigating the menu.\\n\\n In a nutshell all the food we tried was tasty. This is not a fancy place and everything comes in disposable take-out ware and you dine on paper plates with plastic silverware. \\n\\nThe server was pleasant. PRICES ARE LOW and PORTIONS ARE LARGE. The portions were twice as big as we expected and had half left to bring home.\\n\\nWe tried the Chile Chicken, Chicken Biryani and a Spinach Dosa. \\n\\nThe Chile Chicken was made of moist chicken chunks in a fiery chile sauce that was tasty.\\n\\nChicken Biryani was mostly fluffy rice that was infused with spices and fresh mint and cilantro and what I think were tasty caramelized shallots. The chicken was moist and came with yogurt raita and another sauce that was tasty.\\n\\nThe Spinach Dosa is a thin large crepe filled and folded and stuffed with spinach and onions. Three side sauces were served with a Dosa. A vegetable-potato soup, a sauce that tasted like i', 'actual_label': 30, 'predicted_label': 30}, {'text': \"e decided to try the high end of the menu sharing orders of Jhinga Dum Sunerhri (queen prawns simmered in coconut milk, yogurt and a touch of cashew nut sauce) and Goshet Rajawri (boneless lamb cooked in spices, tomatoes, egg, yogurt and a cashew paste).  Entrees included basmati rice, a choice of naan or paratha (we tried both) and lentil side dishes.  This was probably the best Indian meal we have had in Las Vegas. \\n\\n09/07 We returned to find the menu has been largely revised with many new items appearning and prices increased.  Complimentary papadum was served with tamarind and cilantro dipping sauces shortly after we were presented with menus.  The waiter convinced us to try the evening's special appetizer, a crepe made with corn, homemade cheese and potato which proved to be an excellent choice.  Our first entre was Murg chili milli kebab - tandori chicken marinated in Indian spices and accompanied by an East Asian sauce. The chicken was amazingly moist, tender and very flavor-ifi\\nc.  Our second entre was Baingan dahiwala - roasted eggplant cooked with yogurt and onions in a cashew sauce.  This dish was not as smooth textured as similar dishes served elsewhere, but was very tasty.   Menu prices may initially seem high, but most entrees include a side salad, choice of naan or paratha, basmati rice and a lentil dipping sauce - we chose black. Everything was fantastic while service was very attentive without be intrusive.\\n\\n12/07 update to include 3 additional visits\\n\\nWe were served housemade papadum with mint and tamarind sauces followed by a complimentary sweet potato salad that managed to be both spicy and cooling.  My wife ordered the lamb chop masala - small tender chops that had been cooked in masala sauce.  My entre was chicken makhani, aka butter chicken, - melt-in-your mouth pieces of chicken cooked in a creamy tomato sauce.  Both entrees included basmati rice, a black lentil dipping sauce, naan and an unadorned salad.  I signed up online for the restaurant\\n's VIP club and used a 2/1 entre coupon that was emailed to me shortly before we departed for this trip.  \\n\\nWe were the only customers a Saturday afternoon so I suspect luncheon hours may be curtailed in the future.  We each ordered chicken kebab roll - grilled tandoor chicken wrapped in a Romali roll.  Lunches include a choice of ice tea or soda, we chose the ice tea.  The flavor was truly amazing, but the amount of food was more than we needed.  The cost of the meal is net of a $10 coupon received after I provided online feedback on our experience in September.  \\n\\nWe were served complimentary papadum with mint and tamarind sauces. Orders of chicken Chettinad - boneless thigh pieces cooked with pounded southern spices with a hint of coconut and lamb Rajwari - boneless lamb cooked with spices, tomatoes, yogurt and a touch of cashew.  Both dishes included a vegetable dish, naan, rice and salad.  We used a printable 2/1 coupon that had been emailed to members of the restaurant's VIP club\\n)\\nNeeding a snack to carry us over to dinner, my wife and I stopped at this recently (4 days) opened location where we each ordered a single al pastor street taco.  At the expansive salsa bar, we (mostly I) helped ourselves to warm pinto and black beans, marinated carrots and grilled peppers/onions.  This location offers alcoholic drinks and is much larger with an upstairs room and is more upscale than their original location on Tropicana.  There is a good size help yourself salsa bar with salsas, warm beans, pickled carrots, grilled onions and peppers plus more.  \\n\\nThe tacos were very good, but we agreed there was not as much meat though I have given them a little slack because the staff was probably still in training.  \\n\\nA few days later we make a 2nd visit, this time sharing 4 tacos; 3 al pastors and a chorizo.  The quantity of meat was better.  This was the first full weekend for this location so there were 2 customer service representatives helping people plus a DJ.  \\n\\nA great add\\nition to the Eastern Avenue dining scene.\\nMy wife and I have now dined at this restaurant's twin locations multiple times so you can call us fans.  We each ordered our usual a pair of al pastor street tacos and a soda.  These tacos were generously filled and delicious.  We may use of salsa bar for roasted peppers and onions, a variety of salsas, pickled carrots, beans and more.\\nWe stopped in because of the breakfast special offered in the cafe, Sarah's Kitchen, but I walked around the small casino after dining.  It looks like the entire property has undergone a remodeling immediately prior to its recent reopening.  There is a small sports bar, numerous slot machines and not much, if any, in the way of playable video poker so we did not linger. Other than dining there, I don't see us frequenting this casino in the future.\\n12/08 We started off Baba Gandoush - baked eggplant pureed with olive oil and lemon juice and served with warm pita bread (3.5 Forks).  We next ordered Shrimp a la Dia\", 'actual_label': 31, 'predicted_label': 31}, {'text': 'bla - marinated shrimp sautéed with garlic, red pepper and white wine,  spicy and delicious,  and bacon wrapped figs.  (4.5 Forks for each)  Our last order was spinach stuffed mushrooms topped with béchamel sauce and Swiss cheese (3.5 Forks) and Classic Paella - saffron rice mixed with black mussels, shrimp, calamari, peas and carrots.  (4.5 Forks) Service was very attentive and knowledgeable.  \\n\\n09/09 On our second visit we ordered a total of 5 dishes and asked the waiter to space them out appropriately.  Our first dishes were albondigas, meatballs in a spicy tomato sauce (2.5 Forks), and shrimp ajillo, shrimp marinated in garlic & olive oil and then sautéed in white wine with parsley (4 Forks).  We were next served bacon wrapped figs (4 Forks) and papas bravas (roasted and sautéed potatoes served with a spicy sauce (3.5 Forks).  After a long wait I reminded our server that we had one more order to come.  Our last tapa was fried calamari with a very spicy sauce.  The calamari were lig\\nhtly breaded and very tender\\nThis bar is an oasis of sophistication inside the El Cortez.  We manage to visit once per trip during the daily 5-7PM happy hour when all martinis are on 2 for 1 basis. Ask the bartender for the current menu. My personal favorite was recommend to me by the bartender - \"The Bullet\" - Tanguray Ten gin, Romana sambuca and lemon juice.\\nOur dining experience proved to be less than stellar.   An order of kimchi proved to be pretty ordinary - read disappointing while (2) orders of coconut shrimp were very good.   The karage (deep fried chicken) looked pasty though at least chewable while  the garlic calamari was tougher than shoe leather and eventually removed from our bill. Twin orders of bacon wrapped scallops were good as were orders of grilled asparagus, but the twin slices of grilled sweet potato were beyond blah. The chef came by our table most like expecting compliments, but ended up with a critique he probably did not truly appreciate.\\nWe have used E-Z a f\\new times recently because of very competitive rates. On our prior rental we were high pressured by the rental agent to include insurance including a claim that Nevada state law requires it.  Total BS because no other car rental firm in Las Vegas with the possible exception of Fox has made such a claim.  On this rental though the insurance pitch was softened and we were soon out of the parking lot with a low mileage 2014 VW Jetta.  On my return home I realized the Jetta was actually a compact while I rented a mid-size.  I contacted customer service and was told that I would receive a complimentary upgrade on my next rental - hardly adequate compensation IMHO.  On May 23rd, I was contacted by another company official who explained it was an error on their part and offered me a 20% off coupon good for my next rental.  I consider this a genuine and most generous response to my problem.  Color me a happy customer.\\nThis small, slightly frumpy restaurant is populated by locals, but convenient\\nly located for people staying at either the South Point Casino or Grandview timeshare.  We noticed a steady stream of customers stopping to pick-up takeout orders while we were waiting for our meals to be prepared.  My wife and I shared orders of spicy eggplant with chicken and spicy catfish though we requested each at the medium spice level.  Accompanying our orders was a giant sized bowl of white rice.  Both of our dishes were good though we have had better.\\nWe had free tickets earned by playing the My Vegas game on facebook.  Our tickets were for section 201, but we were brought forward and seated just left of center stage in row 5.   Though we thoroughly enjoyed this hip hop dance production, I would hazard a guess that it would hold more appeal for the 20-30 year old crowd than members of AARP.\\nEntrees include a choice of Caesar salad or soup. The Caesar salad here is marginal so we each opted for a cup of minestrone soup which were hearty.  We were also served warm rolls plus the\\n always excellent EVOO, roasted garlic and tomato dipping sauce.  Our entrees were eggplant Parmesan - lightly breaded eggplant, marinara, ricotta and mozzarella.  This meal never fails to fills us up so we once again opted to take our free, with fun book coupons received at hotel check-in, slices of tiramisu to go.\\nThis recently opened Thai restaurant specializes in small plates though regular sized entrees are available.  We started off with the tempura spinach salad with ground chicken, shrimp and lime dressing (4.5 Forks) and white fish cake with lettuce, Thai spices and a sweet chili sauce (2 Forks).  Our second order was a stuffed chicken wing (4) and a crab cake in shell (3).  For dessert we enjoyed the housemade coconut ice cream (4).\\nI read the reviews prior to departing from home on our vacation and was perhaps expecting too much. Order at the counter, get a number and wait at your table for the food to be delivered.  My wife ordered the coconut pancakes (berry lemon compote,', 'actual_label': 31, 'predicted_label': 31}, {'text': \" toasted coconut chips and honey whipped butter) that huge in size and low in flavor sans the compote.  I tried the shakshuka (poached eggs, stewed tomatoes, bell peppers, chili and feta) that came with toasted sourdough bread.  The eggs were buried somewhere under the tomatoes, the feta was limited to a few small pieces and the overall flavor came up short.  This restaurant appears to substitute quantity for quality with prices higher than warranted.\\nNeither the name, location in front of the Fantastic Swap Meet nor physical appearance would suggest fine Chinese dining, but fine dining is what we enjoyed.  Unlike many Asian restaurants, service was both cheerful and attentive.  We shared orders of sauted shrimp coated with mayonnaise with honey walnuts, Singapore rice noodles and pea leaves with garlic.  The latter was not on the menu and relatively expensive at $11, but delicious.\\nOur first brunch of the trip was at Baguette Cafe where we once again ordered vegetable quiches with sid\\ne salads that were enjoyed on the outside patio on a gorgeous day.  We find the  quiches to be generously portioned, moist and delicious. Baguette may be a little hard to find, but it is easy to love.\\nWe decided to have another late weekend breakfast/brunch at Baguette with each of us ordering the vegetable quiche along with a side salad.  In addition, my wife ordered a large, and I do mean large, coffee. In a long line of quiches consumed in recent years, this was the best.  Flaky crust, juicy interior, an assortment of vegetables, delicious and reasonably priced.\\nMy wife and I visited this museum and enjoyed the various exhibits.  It would be a good rainy day activity and, no doubt, best enjoyed to children.\\nThis restaurant offers barrio food in the burbs.We shared a chile relleno burrito and large diet coke in addition to a complimentary salad mix of carrots and jalapenos.  Pretty good for inexpensive fast food.\\nThis small eatery is very popular, but our timing was perfect so were i\\nmmediately seated After reviewing the menu and ogling the plates on surrounding tables we decided to share short stacks of red velvet and strawberry pancakes.  The red velvet pancakes are topped with whipped cream and chocolate chips with a cream cheese syrup served on the side.  The strawberry pancakes include sliced strawberries, a dollop of whipped cream, powdered sugar and strawberry sauce\\nWe started off with cups of soup, Italian wedding for my wife and pasta fagiole for me. Mine proved to be too thick with not a lot of flavor, but hers was very good. We were also served warm rolls topped with sun-dried tomatoes plus the always excellent EVOO, roasted garlic and tomato dipping sauce.  I could have stopped right there and been happy.  For entrees we each ordered eggplant Parmesan that came with a side of pasta that we largely ignored.  For dessert we shared a delicious espresso crème brulee and boxed a tiramisu to go.  The creme brulee was very good, but the tiramisu was flavor-lit\\ne.  It appears the recipes for both the eggplant Parmesan and tiramisu have been adopted  since our last visit as we did not enjoy them as much.  We were able to parlay a pair of free dessert coupons from their funbook with (2) $10 off dining coupons my wife won in a casino promotion.\\nI am not a fan of dinner buffets, but the reviews were good and I had a 50% off coupon from the Las Vegas Advisor, so why not?  Turnover early on a Wednesday evening was a noticeable issue with some small plates obviously sitting under the heat lamp too long. Equally disappointing was the absences of more ethnic dishes.  Our favorite pair of dishes were the duck cassoulet with white beans (me) and an ambrosia salad (wife). Some dishes just plain did not work, a New England clam boil that included a crawfish, but no clams and a ceviche with almost no identifiable seafood.  Unfortunately for my wife, the highly acclaimed bread pudding was dried out and could not be saved by copious amounts of caramel sauce.\\n Service proved to be above average.\\nThe restaurant was close to capacity the Sunday morning of our visit, but we were able to secure a table for 2 in the very chic dining room.  Chef/partner Johnny Church recently departed RX Boiler Room to open this restaurant that puts a spin on comfort food.   It has proven to be so popular that a 2nd location has or will soon be opening in Summerlin. \\n\\nMy wife chose an order of lemon poppy seed pancakes with blueberry-ginger compote that no one short of Fat Albert could possibly finish in one sitting.  My avocado griddle -  eggs with tomatillo sauce, red onions, cilantro, poblano peppers and jack cheese over home fries was more than filling.  Hers was good, mine was nothing short of excellent.\\nOn our recent trips to Las Vegas we always ponder where to have our first breakfast and we always end up at Baguette Cafe.  Olivier's mom was taking the orders this morning plus multi tasking by handling some of the kitchen duties.  My wife got her usual sma\", 'actual_label': 31, 'predicted_label': 31}, {'text': 'll, 16 ounce, coffee while went caffeine free by requesting ice water.  There were 3 different quiches available, but we settled on usual and ordered the vegetarian with side salads. Creamy deliciousness.  As we exited, fat and happy, Olivier thanked us for our business.  \\n\\n4.5 Stars rating would be most appropriate.\\nThe decor, menu and wait staff have been upgraded since its days as The Broiler.  A basket of warm bread was delivered to our table shortly after receiving our menus.  The warm raisin bread being an immediate hit.  My wife chose the Colorado lamb chops, 4 ribs cooked medium rare as requested, that included both a serviceable house salad and baked potato.  I chose the pan seared seabass which was accompanied by sauteed broccoli and salad.  The seabass was generous in size and perfectly grilled, but it would have benefited from a sauce which I neglected to request though a squirt of lemon helped.  The month of May\\'s My Generation specials included paying with  1/2 points at \\nall steakhouses so color me happy.\\nThis small restaurant was very busy so we were told it would be 20 minutes for a table though we actually were seated in under 10.  We were served a bottle of barley tea along with 5 banchan. This time we decided to share 2 different entrees, jap chae (noodles stir fried with bulgogi and vegetables flavored with soy sauce and sesame oil) and cha dol baak boo choo moo chim (stir fried sliced marbled beef, grilled onions and garlic served with chive salad and special sauce).  Both dishes and the banchan were very good though the freshly made kimichi could have been a little more pungent.\\nThis recently opened restaurant is located in the space formerly occupied by Little Buddah.  The room is now more open and brighter than in the past.   A spicy cabbage salad was delivered to our table while we reviewed the menu.  We started off with shrimp spring rolls that were light and tasty.  For entrees we chose sole filets in a fresh black bean sauce plus the chef\\n\\'s special chili chicken.  \\n\\nThere was an exceptionally long delay between courses so our waitress brought us a second dish of cabbage salad and eventually comped us desserts.  The chicken dish was a crunchy delight though not nearly as spicy as one would believe given the quantity of red chili on the plate.  The sole was tender and equally delicious.  Prices are moderate for a casino restaurant and entrees are generously portioned.\\n\\nOur individual cheesecakes, though hardly Asian, almost brought one senior to tears. On entering I had secured a grand opening card from the hostess that was good for 25% off menu prices through October 15th.\\nMy wife had a big smile on her face as she devoured the Ana Banana Foster crepe (a bounty of bananas in a brandy creme de banana sauce, whipped cream and powdered sugar) for breakfast.  I was also smiling as I consumed the Frisco crepe (fresh blueberries in lemon curd, whipped cream and whipped cream). Prices are reasonable, ingredients fresh and serv\\nice comes with a smile.\\nWe previously dined several times at Chef Richard Solano\\'s Mingo and always enjoyed our meals, but had not gotten around to eating at Bomb Tacos until our recent trip.  I was surprised at how tiny the restaurant is with not much in the way of seating.  A few people were occupying tables while waiting for their takeout orders to be prepared.  We ordered a quartet of street tacos, (2) carne asada, 1 each chicken and pastor.  The tiny kitchen was backed up so we had a very long wait, further exacerbating the shortage of available tables.  Another table was occupied an employee and friend who having their lunch.  We did sample the pickled carrots which were fine, but no better than those found elsewhere and the salsas were pretty ordinary as well.  On receiving our order, we could not distinguish by one taco from another except for the al pastor which was topped with pineapple because all the meat had been diced and fried into oblivion.\\nWe had dinner on a first nigh\\nt of stay at the South Point.  We each ordered our usual eggplant Parmesan which is stuffed with ricotta.  Entrees include a side dish of penne pasta with marinara sauce and a choice of salad or soup.  We received a bread basket along with their delicious dipping sauce of roasted red peppers and garlic cloves plus olive oil.  Unfortunately, our Caesar salads looked like coleslaw and were devoid of any \"Caesar\" taste.  \\n\\nOur entrees were bountiful, but it was quite obvious each came from a different batch.  Mine was topped with a large amount of melted mozzarella while my wife\\'s was charred on the edges with little in the way of cheese.  She ended eating less than half of hers and about a 14 of mine.  \\n\\nWe were both full so we used free dessert coupons from the fun books received at check-in for takeout orders of tiramisu and cappuccino cheesecake.  We also took advantage of the  1/2 point dining promotion that ran on Tuesday and Wednesdays in March. We had the desserts the following da', 'actual_label': 31, 'predicted_label': 31}, {'text': 'y and felt the cheescake had way too much crust and not enough cream cheese.\\nWe were there for the monthly food fair so we took the opportunity to visit the main meditation room as well as the beautiful courtyard.\\nWe each ordered a  1/2 Bastille Panini (portabella mushroom, roasted red peppers, provolone, red onions, tomatoes, alfalfa sprouts and sundried tomato mayo) plus a cup of Redrock seafood bisque.  I would return for the bisque, but the MSRP of the Panini seemed high.\\nThis mom and pop Mexican restaurant serves authentic fare.  We each ordered huevos rancheros which came with chips & salsa, rice, refried beans and warm tortillas.  The owner also served us complimentary cups of their delicious consomme loco which is a fat free chicken rice soup spiked with cilantro.  Neither of us could do this bountiful meal justice.  Our bill fell short of the minimum purchase requirement on our gift certificate so we ordered a slice of flan to go.  Later the same day we shared the flan which w\\ne found to be tasty, but a bit too heavy.\\nThis small, but popular Korean/Mexican restaurant, is located on Decatur Blvd. The staff was very friendly and offered to take our order while we waited for a table.  Our fried wontons, 4 per serving and costing a mere $1, were good, but totally unnecessary since they were preceded by complimentary housemade chips, salsa and guacamole.  Our order of 4 barbecue tacos (2 pork, 1 chicken and a beef) came with cilantro, lettuce, onions and kimchee, the latter being optional.  Each was very good to excellent, though next time I would skip the beef in flavor (sic) of the pork or chicken\\nThis restaurant is in a large office park and only open for breakfast and lunch Monday - Friday. The weather was close to picture perfect so after ordering cups of their house made soup, we settled in at a table on the patio.  Ann\\'s Manhattan clam chowder was chock full of fresh vegetables and bursting with flavor.  My cream of asparagus soup was silky smooth and deli\\ncious, but paled in comparison.  The only negative was our soup was not hot enough which I attribute to our server not realizing we had camped out on the patio.  There is little doubt in my mind that we will be returning to try one of their quiches in the not too distant future.\\nPrior to driving over from our hotel, my wife called to confirm that our restaurant.com certificate would be accepted since Soyo no longer participates in the program.  We were assured it would as long as it was issued prior to 6/20/14 - mine was purchased 6/19/14.  Shortly after being seated, we received complimentary bowls of barley tea and 6 banchan.  After reviewing the menu we settled on spicy pork ribs with spicy Korean BBQ sauce, kimchi fried rice with egg and spicy grilled chicken with mozzarella.  Each dish was very good as was the service.\\nA Maryland crab house, located in the desert - what will they think of next? On Thursdays, medium crabs and all bottled beers are $3 each.  We ordered 6, crabs, not\\n beers, plus sides of sweet potato tots and coleslaw.  With mallets in hand we took to hammering away at the blue crabs while washing everything down with a pair of Stella Artois\\'.  The crabs were delicious, but varied in size so I am not convinced these were all \"medium\".  The sweet  potato tots were outstanding and the coleslaw was refreshing.  Our personable server also brought us samples of 3 house-made soups: lobster bisque, Maryland crab, and clam chowder.  The lobster bisque was excellent though the other 2 were not far behind.\\nThis is one of those rare restaurants that everyone seems to enjoy including my wife and I. Olivier was not manning the cash register,  but mom was in the kitchen so all was well.  We each ordered the vegetable quiche with a side salad that was nicely portioned and delicious.  Her coffee was super sized, refills not required though she did have them warm it up.  Since our last visit, the restaurant is now opening on weekends which is great news for locals\\n not working the immediate area.\\nThere are only 5 tables in this casual restaurant, but we only required one. We shared orders of pad Thai and a special of pumpkin curry with chicken.  The pad Thai was probably the best we have had recently and the pumpkin curry was loaded with flavor.  Prices are very reasonable. .\\nWas it insanity or a senior moment?  I have made the same mistake in the past when we stayed at the South Point, but I thought the restaurant would be reasonably close to Sam\\'s.  It wasn\\'t so don\\'t do it.  This location and its S. Buffalo counterpart are always busy for breakfast, but we lucked out and did not have to wait for a table though a waiting line formed shortly thereafter.  My wife ordered the banana cream pie pancakes, I ordered crepe-like lemon ricotta. Even after drizzling the pancakes with 2 containers of cream cheese syrup and lemon segments, mine were virtually tasteless.  Hers was delicious, mine was not.  She finished hers, I did not.  She was very happy, ', 'actual_label': 31, 'predicted_label': 31}, {'text': 'I was not.\\nWe received warm rolls which we normally would refuse, but not tonight because we knew from past experience that they would be accompanied by a small bowl of roasted garlic, chopped tomatoes and EVO.  We each ordered the eggplant Parmesan which came with a choice of soup, salad or pasta.  Ann chose the excellent pasta faglioli while I ordered a salad dressed with tomato basil vinaigrette.  The eggplant, stuffed with ricotta, was very good and I was able to use a 2 for 1 coupon from a locals mailer.\\nYou don\\'t come to a Maryland crab house, be it in Baltimore or Las Vegas, seeking ambiance and we didn\\'t.  We were unable to adjust our schedule to take advantage of the Tuesday and Thursday crab specials so we opted to share a crab cake entree which came with (2) 1/3 pound lump meat crab cakes and 2 sides with us choosing coleslaw and sweet potato tots. The crab cake had little observable filler and large chunks lump crab, just the way I make them at home.\\nThe restaurant was cute\\n with colorful umbrellas hanging down from the ceiling.  There was a short line upon entering, but it took us an unusually long time to be seated though we could see a few tables that had been prepped and empty. \\n\\nWe decided to share a full stack of pancakes plus strawberries. The sliced strawberries were served on the side and our 5 medium sized pancakes were nothing to write home about.  Overall we were underwhelmed by this dining experience.  \\n\\nA rating of 2.5 would be most appropriate.\\nFinally our vacation coincided with the monthly food fare this past April.  At around 10AM, the parking lot was full so we parked on a residential street leading to this Buddhist monastery. We checked to see what the various vendors were offering after exchanging $10 for $10 in Thai coins. There was no signage, but each vendor proved to be friendly and helpful. Upon deciding what we wanted to try, we encountered long lines at most of the stalls and even a longer wait for the food to be prepared. \\n\\nWe\\n started off by ordering a pair of roti canai ($1 each) that were prepared on a grill and topped with condensed milk and powdered sugar before being rolled up. The estimated time before pick-up of 15 minutes proved to be optimistic, but worth the delay because each tasted far better than one would expect given the list of ingredients. \\n\\nThere was no wait time for our second order, 4 skewers of BBQ pork satay ($5) that were also enjoyable.  In addition, we picked up a bottle of water ($1). Our last order, pad Thai, proved to be a steal at $5, but the estimate for pick-up of 40 minutes again proved to be highly optimistic.  Though the cost of brunch exceeded my initial $10 buy-in, we discovered the vendors readily accepted American dollars.  Note: the food fair is typically scheduled for the last Sunday of the month, but does vary so check the online schedule before making plans to visit.\\nThis restaurant occupies the space formerly housing Chris Herron\\'s highly acclaimed Bread and Butter\\n. I selected a scone and a kouign amann from the display case that we enjoyed in our hotel room.  Both were freshly baked and of excellent quality. A return visit is assured.\\nWe were told when we made our reservations that they probably wouldn\\'t be necessary which proved to true.  There was a free concert by Genevieve on the green that evening so the terrace was full, but the dining room was empty with the exception of one other table.  The restaurant itself is beautiful, but I doubt overhead expenses are covered except on weekends.  The waitress asked if we wanted guacamole with our chips and we responded affirmatively.  The guacamole was very good and we were amazed that it was complimentary since other restaurants charge $6-10 per order.   The restaurant serves both traditional Tex-Mex dishes and \"fresh\" seafood entrees.  We each chose the \"fresh\" halibut in spinach cream sauce which was accompanied by chipotle mashed potatoes, green beans and carrots.  The halibut was overcooked an\\nd I was surprised, but shouldn\\'t have been, to find a $6 charge for the guacamole included on our bill.\\nWe received pappadum plus delicious tamarind and mint sauces to begin our meal and after an exceptionally long wait we received our aloo tiki, deep fried mashed potatoes, which were overdone and virtually inedible.  \\n\\nA few minutes later the remainder of our meal, chicken makahani, lamb saag, plain basmati rice and kabuli naan (stuffed with raisins and nuts) appeared.  The naan was flat as a pancake and the filling was very bland.  Both entrees were large and delicious though the lamb was on the tough side. We concluded the meal with a shared portion of carrot halwa which was a bit too sweet.  \\n\\nService, other then by the busboy, was abysmal from start to finish.  The sole waiter, I am guessing the owner, sat in a booth across the room from us playing with a cell phone and never once looked in our direction to determine if we or any of the other diners needed anything.  I had to call', 'actual_label': 31, 'predicted_label': 31}, {'text': \" the busboy over to get our check and then it took the waiter an inordinate amount of time to process the payment.\\nAfter enjoying pastries from CraftKitchen on our last trip, we decided to have a sit down breakfast this morning with each of us choosing avocado toast.   A massive amount of avocado on a grilled toast, sunflower pesto and a single poached egg proved to be delicious, but hardly worth the sticker price.\\nMy wife and I settled on a wide variety of small plates that included:  cucumber salad w/seaweed & yam (3.5), bok choy ohitashi (2.5), garlic edamame (4.5), chicken thigh steak (4.5), enoki mushroom wrapped w/bacon (3), shishito pepper (2), tsukune (4.5), age nasu & mochi oroshini (2.5) and a small rice (2.5).  As noted by my assigned rating for each dish, quality ranged from fair to very good with price points well below the more famous Raku.\\nThis is a small husband/wife operated restaurant where the wife serves as manager and waitress while the husband and his 2 apprentice\\ns make the same hand drawn noodles as at the highly (expensive) regarded Beijing Noodle No. 9 in Caesars.  We started with an order of vegetable spring rolls that were light and flavorful. We also shared a bowl of Lan Zhou noodle soup which was delicious, but a bit too spicy for Ann.\\nI expected to encounter long lines due to a free burger promotion on this Thursday at lunch time, but the place was not busy.  Though this restaurant has been open for several months, we were told by an employee that no one knows its open because of its location at the far end of the center.  The coupons, I printed 2, were good for standard burgers that come with lettuce, tomato, onion and American cheese plus we shared a soda.  The burgers were tasty, but dry from being overcooked.\\nDinner at Don Vito's Italian Restaurant in the South Point is almost mandatory for us though we ventured away from our traditional eggplant Parmesan for the first time in several years. We received a basket of hot sundried toma\\nto rolls plus their excellent roasted garlic/tomato dipping sauce to start off while we reviewed the menu.  Entrees include a side of penne (meh!) and a choice of soup or Caesar salad.  We have never been impressed by their salad so we both opted for cups of Italian wedding soup.  \\n\\nFor an entree my wife ordered Chicken Angelo (sauteed with artichoke hearts, olives, and mushrooms in a white wine sauce).  I followed up with Chicken Marsala (sauteed with mushrooms and garlic in a demi glaze and Marsala wine).  Both plates included crisp green beans.  For dessert Ann ordered zabaglione with fresh berries while her companion chose an espresso crème brulee.  As good as my brulee was, and it was, the zabaglione was even better or so I am told since she only gave me one small spoonful.\\nI am not sure how this small, casual, Mexico City-type eatery managed to find its way on the dining guide, Eating Las Vegas:  The 50 Essential Restaurants, but, but the clear chicken broth with an abundance of \\nrice, cilantro, shredded chicken and avocado always satisfies in a way only a homemade soup could.\\nWe decided there was no better place in Las Vegas to have breakfast on the first morning of our vacation than Baguette Cafe.  Much to our disappointment we learned Olivier's mother, aka the queen of the kitchen, was on holiday in France, but we forged ahead with each of us ordering a croissant and egg sandwich - Swiss cheese omelet, spinach, tomato basil sauce on a hot croissant. The thin omelet in a hot, buttery croissant was melt in your mouth delicious. We asked if they had any financiers and were told only Olivier's mother could make them properly.  \\n\\nWe returned later in the trip to find Oivier MIA, but mom was now presiding over the kitchen.  Once again we ordered croissant and egg sandwiches plus an excellent financier.  Hail to Olivier's mom.\\nWe typically take a pass on the bread basket, but make an exception at this restaurant because of the accompanying EVOO, sundried tomato, he\\nrbs and roasted garlic dipping sauce - so good!  Entrée prices include a choice of soup or salad. My wife wisely ordered the delicious minestrone while received a rather blah house salad.  We ordered our usual eggplant Parmesan that is baked with marinara sauce, mozzarella and ricotta.  This dish melts in your mouth and, even though I was not overly hungry, I managed to finish every morsel earning me a gold star. The accompanying penne with marinara was pretty good as well though we barely nibbled on it.  Neither of us could handle dessert, but we had free dessert coupons from the funbooks received at check-in so we asked to have two tiramisus packaged up for later consumption. These turned out to be very large and runny, but they tasted pretty good.\\nWe arrived on a Sunday evening and was surprised to find a fairly large and nicely decorated restaurant close to empty on a Sunday evening.  New owners took over this location in late August, renaming the former Pin Kaow, but retaining bot\", 'actual_label': 31, 'predicted_label': 31}, {'text': 'h the chef and servers. The restaurant first came up on my radar when I checked under new restaurants on restaurant.com We started with an order of shrimp rolls that were crisp, but largely devoid of shrimp.  For entrees we shared orders of spicy basil shrimp and catfish. The catfish was not at all crispy while the spicy basil shrimp proved to be just okay.\\nWe arrived early on a Tuesday evening to discover a 2-piece band playing while a vegetarian buffet was being offered though there were only 3 other customers.  We were told we could not use a Groupon in conjunction with the buffet so we ordered off the menu as we originally planned.  The thin, crispy papadum with mint chutney proved to be an excellent beginning. After reviewing the menu, we settled on orders of garlic naan, butter chicken royale and palak (spinach) chicken that were served with basmati rice. I sent back the \"garlic\" naan because it was obviously neither \"garlic\" nor fresh. In a quick flash our server returned with a\\n fresh order of \"garlic\" naan that was entirely different from what was originally served.  The butter chicken sauce was both bountiful and excellent tasting though both entrees had less than $3 of chicken split between them. The spinach both looked and tasted like it had been recycled from the prior day\\'s buffet table.\\nOnce again the first morning of our Las Vegas vacation arrived and a decision had to be made on where to we go for our first breakfast.  Easy decision because we put our rental car on autopilot and directed it to Baguette.  On entering, we inquired of what varieties of quiche were available, but I knew and she (my wife) knew we would be ordering roasted vegetable quiches with small side salads. Since there was a chill in the air, we dined in though a few hardy souls chose the patio.  Was the quiche as good as the past?  An emphatic yes!\\nThis restaurant is very basic, serving as both a restaurant and banquet hall.  On this Saturday evening a large group from Nellis Airfo\\nrce base occupied 2 long banquet tables with the remaining diners scattered around the large room.   \\n\\nWe shared a delicious appetizer of Kashk-E-Bademjan, fried eggplant mixed with Kashk (whey) flavored with sauteed garlic and mint. We also shared an order of Shiraz, a Persian salad of fresh chopped cucumbers, tomatoes, parsley, onion and house dressing that was less satisfying.  Ann\\'s entrée was Fesenjon, fried walnut pomegranate sauce, mixed with boiled chicken and a side of Basmati rice.  My entrée was another stew, Baghali Polo, basmati rice mixed with fresh dill and lima beans served with a cooked lamb shank in tomato sauce.  The amount of rice served was almost overwhelming.    \\n\\nThe owner, Amy, stopped by our table to inquire how we enjoyed our meal and ended up sitting with us for a half hour while we enjoyed complimentary orders of baklava and tea.  \\n\\nI would rate this restaurant 2.5 Stars.\\nStand aside Donald Trump because here is Westie\\'s version of the \"Art of the Deal\". We\\n both chose eggplant Parmesan which was very reasonably priced at $13.95; entrees include a basket of warm rolls and choice of either a house salad or soup.  Ann chose pasta faglioli which was delicious while I paid an extra $1 to upgrade to a mundane Caesar salad.  \\n\\nSounds like a pretty good deal so far, but by ordering 2 entrees between 5PM and 6PM we received a complimentary half bottle of Ruffino Chianti.  Our entrees were very good and each came with a side order of ziti topped by a serviceable marinara.  \\n\\nThis would have been a good deal had we stopped there, but it got better when I brandished a funbook coupon for 2 free desserts under the waiter\\'s nose, mine a pretty credible version of crème brulee while Ann\\'s tiramisu was blah. \\n\\n Hold on to your toupee Donald because there is more, on Wednesdays all food is half off when using points. Our total bill before application of coupons, points and other discounts was $53.97, but only $14.95 (5,000 points) was charged to my slot c\\nard\\nOn arrival we were told it would be 30 minutes before seats would be \\navailable, but the same meal could be prepared for us in the kitchen. We opted for this alternative rather than wait which turned out to be a big, big mistake. We started out with the edamame appetizer. This represented our first and last experience with boiled salted soybeans - totally tasteless. My wife chose the halibut dinner while I requested chicken. She received two decent sized pieces of fish, but each was overdone. My chicken, cut into  inch cubes, was dry. Each entree included miso soup, noodles, veggies, rice and salad. The soup was hot, but everything else was  served cold. Service was affable, but slow.\\nIt is nicely decorated though I think the plasma TVs in the dining area playing an Arabic version of MTV are out of place.   Their mezze, an assortment of appetizers, seemed outrageously overpriced at $24, so we ordered baba ghannou, roasted eggplant with lemon juice and garlic dip served with warm pi', 'actual_label': 31, 'predicted_label': 31}, {'text': \"ta triangles.  It was good, but I thought the addition of olive oil detracted from the taste and texture.  My wife's entre was kafta kabob, minced lamb with chopped onion and spices and served with tziki sauce while I ordered lamb kabob.  The kafta kabob was too light on the spices.  I ordered the lamb kabob medium rare and it ended up being both fatty and overcooked.  Our entrees were accompanied by rice and a bland salad.\\nOnce again we found ourselves at Don Vito's door and he welcomed us in.  We started off with complimentary glasses of wine courtesy of American Casino Guide coupons plus a bread basket accompanied the Don's excellent roasted garlic, sundried tomato and EVOO dipping sauce.   Entrees include a choice of soup or salad with my wife choosing the Caesar salad while I a cup of pasta fagiole. The soup was very good while the salad was okay.  The Mrs. chose chicken Angelo (chicken sauteed with mushrooms, artichoke hearts, and black olives) in a white wine sauce.  The gentlem\\nan selected the Mediterranean seafood salad (a mix of shrimp, scallops, calamari and lobster that had lightly marinated in herbs and EVOO and served on a bed of lettuces, tear drop tomatoes and capers).  Both dishes to proved to be amply portioned and very good.  We happened to be dining on a Monday evening and we happen to be seniors so the Don only charged 1/2 points on my wife's slot card.  I was honored with the privilege of paying the tip.\\nWe are long time fans of this out of the way, breakfast and luncheon spot.  Olivier was handling the cash register and offering comments and advice while his parents were in the kitchen.  I answered the question - do real men eat quiche by ordering the vegetable quiche prepared with spinach, tomatoes, zucchini and goat cheese while my wife chose traditional with cheddar and Swiss cheeses plus bacon. Hers was very good, mine was even better.\\nThis takeout restaurant is located in a kiosk on the fringe of Dino's Lounge's parking lot that was former\\nly occupied by Viva Arepas.  We reviewed the small menu and decided to share a reuben-ish (house cured corned beef, Swiss cheese, fennel sauerkraut, and 1,000 Islands dressing) plus a bottle of coke.  There are no tables, but a few chairs are available abutting the kiosk.  The temperature was on the cool side so we opted to dine in the comfort of our car.  There were several people in front of us, but the wait was worth it because the sandwich was delicious.  While waiting the owner thanked me for our business and said they would be relocating in January to more spacious quarters in the Soho Lofts at 900 LV Blvd.\\nOn entering we were warmly greeted by an employee as we approached the counter.  There were baked goods on display, but none of them looked very interesting.  The interior is very bright with sun streaming through large windows so we ended up sitting in the adjoining and commonly owned Metro Pizza to avoid the glare.  My wife's stuffed French toast was just okay, but nothing t\\no write home about, though I am mentioning it now.  I chose benecio del porko (grilled cornbread topped with a generous portion of BBQ pulled pork, Hollandaise sauce, easy over eggs, charred corn, cotija cheese and cilantro) that you should only order if you are or want to be a porko.  Mine dish was different, but nothing I would ever order again.\\nThis small mom and pop (doing the cooking) and son (Oliver at the cash register) restaurant is now one of our favorite luncheon destinations.  It is hard to locate on your first visit, but worth the effort. It was very busy on the day of our visit and we were lucky to score a table.  The soup of the day changes, drum roll please, daily and to date we have sampled 3 that were truly excellent.  Today's was shrimp bisque which had a silky texture and was full of flavor. Olivier recommended the chicken curry sandwich with red peppers and parsley on a freshly baked baguette which we shared.  This proved to be the best lunch we have had in recent m\\nemory.  \\n\\nA rating of 4.5 stars would be most appropriate.\\nWe decided to give this buffet that offers small plates with a heavy emphasis on ethnic cuisine a try late on a Monday evening courtesy of the Las Vegas Advisor's 2/1 coupon. Even though it was late in the evening, there was a short, slow moving line.  After being seated, we made our beverage request followed by a quick walk through before settling on a few dishes to sample.  I pretty much avoided standard American fare in favor ethnic dishes.  Mussels cooked in coconut curry sauce, a caterpillar roll, sesame chicken and BBQ shrimp and grits were my initial choices with each recommendable though many of the mussel shells were unopened and needed to be discarded.  I selected bone marrow, among a number of other dishes, on my next run through, but it was uneatable due to overcooking.  More successful were the shrimp sushi and a variety of vegetable dishes including beets, fingerling potatoes and mixed vegetables.  The number of d\", 'actual_label': 31, 'predicted_label': 31}, {'text': 'esserts offered was not impressive, but I managed to satisfy my sweet tooth.  Overall, I enjoyed the buffet, but would not return without another sizable discount.\\nWe took an elevator up to restaurant located on the 16th floor of the hotel.  This restaurant reminds me of the Voodoo Café at the Rio which the Marnell family owned back in the good old days. The restaurant occupies the entire floor with spectacular views of the valley through the floor to ceiling windows running the length of the restaurant.  \\n\\nWe were seated in a booth providing us with a clear, but distant view of the lights from the Strip.  We were not sufficiently hungry, after having apps earlier in the evening at Marinelli\\'s to order entrees, so we settled on a few small plates.  The first was chicken lettuce wraps - spicy chicken, peanuts, scallions and water chestnuts with a black bean sauce. There was not enough black bean sauce to offset the dryness of the chicken.  We fared better with our second choice - crab c\\nakes served over cole slaw with papaya sauce.\\nWe have dined at this location several times when it was originally occupied by Bon Jour Bistro and most recently by the American Grill.  We shared orders of Pho ga tang (chicken noodle soup served with cilantro, basil, bean sprouts, jalapeno and hoisin sauce) and cha gio (crisp spring rolls that you wrap in a piece of lettuce and dip in nuoc cham (Vietnamese dipping sauce)).  The basil was not fresh so I requested more and got what I asked for, more un-fresh basil.  The flavor of the pho was mild and the chicken was limited to a few shreds.\\nThis tiny storefront restaurant has received a measure of notoriety since an article appeared in the Las Vegas Weekly indentifying it as celebrity Chef Alex Stratta\\'s favorite restaurant for authentic Mexico City cuisine.  Alex was dining elsewhere this day, but the restaurant was fairly busy.  Orders are placed at the counter and then while waiting for the food you can munch on not so authentic taco ch\\nips served with two homemade salsas, tomatillo and chipotle.  We each ordered a bowl of consommé loco, a rich chicken broth with shredded chicken, avocado and fresh cilantro that were accompanied by a pair of fresh corn tortillas - muy bueno!\\n\\nA week later we returned for lunch and again enjoyed the consomme loco.\\nWe drove out to Red Rock Canyon National Conservation Area with an intermediate stop at the visitors\\' center. It was an archaeology day of sort so there were several exhibits on display and the center itself was packed with people.   We then followed the scenic 13 mile loop drive making a few stops along the way for photos and to view the many rock climbers.\\nWe made a return visit for bowls of loco consommé, a delicious chicken rice soup with cilantro and avocado.  The soup is low fat and loaded with shredded chicken, avocado and cilantro.\\nWe received warm rolls and a small bowl of EVO with sundried tomatoes and roasted garlic.  Entrees include a choice of soup or salad; we e\\nach chose the pasta fagioli which was pretty good though it would have benefited by the addition of some herbs.  My entrée was spaghetti and meatballs while Ann chose eggplant parmesan.  Both were a little better than satisfactory though Ann\\'s would have benefited by some additional gravy (sauce).  We used coupons from the funbooks received a check-in for free desserts, tiramisu and crème brulee.\\nThis restaurant is included in the \"Eating Las Vegas\" The 50 Essential Restaurants\" dining guide.  We started off with an order of fried dumplings with special sauce that were filled with fresh and delicious ingredients.  \\n\\nWe also shared orders of Dolsoi bimimbap and very spicy grilled chicken with mozzarella on the top.  The former is a popular Korean dish of stir fried vegetables, beef and egg on rice served in a very hot stone pot that serves to caramelize the rice.  Both dishes were very good, but the chicken with mozzarella will bring us back.  We also received 6 banchans (small side dis\\nhes): kimchi, daikon, sweet daikon, a seaweed type concoction with cream cheese, greens and some form of noodle dish.  \\n\\nA rating of 4.5 is most appropriate.\\nMy wife and I shared a shrimp cocktail and calamari appetizers. The shrimp, numbering 4, were good sized, but the dish would have benefited by more cocktail sauce. The calamari were lightly fried, but the portion size proved to be too large for us. A bread basket with the Don\\'s excellent dipping sauce proved too tempting though I knew we had over ordered since entrees include a Caesar salad or soup with us ordering the former. My wife ordered the chicken Angelo entree with me going for our usual eggplant Parmesan. Both were very good though belt busting. I used our $25 gift card won in the current promotion plus 2 ACG free appetizer coupons.  Don Vito\\'s service and food are consistently good.\\nI remembered reading that this franchise primarily serves chicken fingers so when I saw the sign I made a U-turn and walked in.  I bought tw', 'actual_label': 31, 'predicted_label': 31}, {'text': \"tick and the soft cream cone.\\nRIDES - the two haunted house rides were comically bad, but the two roller coasters and drop tower ride were all fun. On Wednesday they were all $2 each and paying anymore than that would have been disappointing. \\nCONCERT - It was tough to find how to get upstairs, but Rick Springfield was a good show.\\n\\nOther Fun things to catch:\\n   The Jellybean exhibit is classic and a good time and the candy display might be interesting for certain people. Park for $5 down at church and use admission discounts.\\nIt was 10:30pm and I have been here less than a week. As I'm wandering down roads with no direction, all I see is the usual fast food joints, but finally I eyed a hole in the wall and after two U-turns I made my way into the drive-thru via a narrow alleyway very similiar to a joint in Vegas that also had good Mexican fare. I ordered through the usual garbled audio system at the drive through and asked for double rice to replace my side of beans - no problem. The \\ntwo beef tacos were really tasty - the taco shells were as crisp as possible, but did not break apart when you bit into the tender shredded beef that was inside. Simply adorned with cheese and lettuce, the green sauce took these tacos to a new level. It wasn't spicy, but had a great taste that kicked up the tacos flavor (jalapeno probably). Will be back for breakfast, but if your sick of the usual fast food, try to make your way here for some good real tacos.\\nEveryone got insulted, everyone got hats and everyone had fun and as a bonus most of the food was good too. I even got some insults in as well, one of my longtime favorite things to do. This was a lunchtime roast and the waiter got most things right, calling out one lesbian, one guy who wasn't getting any action and a few older folks jokes. It was everything we had expected to happen and most of us will remember (or forget) it forever. \\n    So, the various versions of mac and cheese were all pretty good. Those twisty noodles and l\\nong strips of flavorful chicken elevated this dish to a good level. The guy getting no action also enjoyed his fish and chips. Personally, I had a liquid lunch with a giant margarita for $16 - true tourist stuff. Enjoy the show.\\nNothing wrong here.Seems like it's just random luck when you arrive as to what donuts are available, the size of the line and other factors. I had the luck of the Irish on my first ever visit as a tray of hot glazed donuts just appeared during my selection process. I had that one right away and that was perfection. Of the other donuts I tried, the ones with chocolate cake as a base were all good. Coffee was very good as well. These are better than the make your own craze going around town. The pricetag for six was about 11 bucks.\\nRolled through the drive-through for the first time and it was very successful. I have eaten at this chain before, but it didn't seem like a drive through kind of place. The large chop salad came fairly quickly and it consists of mostl\\ny lettuce, some onions, cherry tomatoes and cucumbers. It actually might need a few more veggies, but the top quality grilled chicken makes up for that loss. They include two dressings and you get bread of your choice with your meal. They should include some butter in the bag and it was a bit of an overkill as they try to upsell you several times at the menu board.\\nTHIS IS THE GM JAKE LAYTON RIPPING ON HIS OWN FOOD\\nYeah I wouldn't recommend chicken at a fast casual establishment if you want prime chicken breast meat. We offer the best turkey I have ever eaten and the chicken is not the quality of the turkey\\n\\nUPDATE: Jake is not nice. He likes engaging customers via email and trying to defend his chain's crappy food rather than accepting that the customer is right. Jake won't last in that industry long in the age of social media. \\n\\nWill start with the good. They hired a new manager (Jake from Utah) and he reached out to me to offer a free meal from a bad meal that I had way back in Febr\\nuary. Jake was very nice and anybody who leaves three stars or less on a review will likely get the free meal offer. I ordered the chicken chopped salad and he threw in a free pastry, which is the only reason this place didn't get one star. \\n\\nThe pecan tart - half covered with chocolate - was excellent, but the salad had major issues. A good portion of the chicken was inedible due to fatty pieces of meat. Some of the chicken was in strips, but there were alot of odd chicken pieces also tossed in there as well. Finally, a salad needs good lettuce, but I couldn't eat 75% of the lettuce served. Most of the lettuce was brown, wet and had a dark, dark green color. Well Jake, you might be the GM, but he needs to improve the food quality, not just offer disgruntled guests another bad meal.\\nAhh Taco Tuesday - a way to get you in the door and eat inferior tacos. The review for the crunchy tacos here still stands - those were pretty good.

Those cost $11 each and every day. Part 1 of taco Tuesday exploring.\\nFirst off, thanks to GM Michael for taking the time to read my review (and others) and act on the complaints/suggestions. Many owners/managers have written me, but few have gone to this extent to make sure I was satisfied (including texting me). Not going to recap my old review, but the side dishes were much improved and the brisket sandwich was stacked with that same excellent brisket from my previous visit. I would even suggest to get the sandwich over the platter due to more meat. They even added a new cole slaw which is mayo based and that was my favorite. The vinegar slaw was much improved with celery salt and the mac and cheese has r\\neturned to the original recipe and now includes Ritz cracker crumbs instead of panko. The staff is very friendly and for me - finding Mello Yellow Zero in the freestyle machine was a plus. Once again, thanks for bringing me back from the dark side.\\nLate night visit to the drive through. The rolled tacos with guac and cheese were very crispy and tasted good. My cheese quesadilla was just cheddar cheese, but it was large and worth 4 bucks. The side of rice was tiny, so get a pint if you need more. Both sauces were too watery, but the horchata was decent enough.\\nFirst off, the side dishes were unimpressive to say the least. The only side that was worthy was the Sweet Potato fries. The mac and cheese, although pretty, is loaded with bread crumbs and that is all it tastes like. Cole slaw was miserable and the beans tasted like canned pork and beans. The brisket platter is what I ordered and it was solid brisket with a good bark and some fat also which is easily removed. I suppose the highli\\nght is their lot of at least 10 different BBQ sauces, most of which are pretty tasty depending on your taste. The one with the chipotle was my favorite. Just cause Triple D visited doesn\\'t mean anything. I have been to several of his places he visited and they weren\\'t great either. The gas station thing is a nice angle and the outdoor patio looks inviting too, but they need to improve in certain areas or actually I would just get the sandwich with the chips next time if you heed my advice.\\nFinally tried this place out for one hour with three people at 1pm. Total cost was $40. You only need one membership card if you aren\\'t really interested in keeping score or the other people  in your party likely won\\'t be returning. It was fun, really nothing to complain about, except my golf swing. Only tried the chips with salsa and guacamole for $7 and that dish was worth the money. If you get the chance, go downstairs and they have the Wii and shuffleboard available to kill another 30 minutes. Wi\\nll be back at some point, but plenty of room at the bar and food was good, so golfing is not even necessary on the return visit.\\nPretty much the perfect Sunday football experience. If your a Packers fan, this is the place to be, but if a fan of any other team, you might want to stay away because your game may not be on and if it is, it will be on a very small and older TV. I went with a Packers fan and luckily I could see my Giants getting mauled on another TV.\\nThe bloody Mary\\'s were excellent at $3.50 a pop (ask for a pickle), but no other drink specials. The philly cheese steak was the best I had in ages and is in my Top 5 list. White American, ribeye, onions, sweet and bell peppers and the cheese curds were authentic as possible. Friend from Wisconsin said the curds were the best she has had since home. Marcie was a great waitress, just too bad the packed bar had to leave sad after a wild loss.\\nExcellent choice of flavors and toppings - most Yogurt places seem to be carbon copies of\\n eachother, so now I rate places based on sample cups being available without having to ask at the busy counter. The sample cups are indeed hiding behind the register and you must ask and only get three samples to try. The other beef that I had was the kid did not give me a spoon to eat my yogurt with and those spoons are indeed also behind the counter. Hide your sample cups and spoons - people are coming into the store. If you forget to give me a spoon at a yogurt place, you really should be fired. Oh the Pecan Pralines flavor was quite good as I took a chance since I ran out of sample cups to try that flavor.\\nDecent slice for a fair price. Not gonna win any awards, but it was a foldable slice and they had many choices available, but no indication on how long those pizza pies were sitting out in the open world. Some of the slices looked like they were on death\\'s doorstep.\\n  No lunch specials either, but all slices are between $2.75 and $3.25. My choice today was on the upper end and i', 'actual_label': 32, 'predicted_label': 32}, {'text': 't was the unusual provolone slice. I think it just had a piece of prov with some tomatoes instead of mozzarella. It needed a good dose of garlic, black pepper and parmesan, but finally the flavors came out. We clearly do not live in NY and the pizza quality in Phoenix (at least NY style) reflects this opinion. \\n    Plus get your AC fixed. At 110 outside, it may have only been 99 inside. Tables should be wiped also more often.\\nNothing beats dining al fresco in the Phoenix version of summertime. Snagged a seat outside here with cousin and had a few enjoyable meals. His meditterean Chicken appeared healthy as it came off the Heart healthy menu. Enough healthy stuff, my order was stuffed chicken and this was prepared way different than normal, which is usually spinach and cheese inside. In this version, it was goat cheese mostly with some cheddar and sun dried tomatoes. The chicken breast was sliced into four pieces and it was kind of served open face. It looked small, but was filling at 1\\n5 bucks (see photo). I switched out the Kale concoction for Garlic mashed potatoes (the garlic fries appetizer was way better) and there was some average veggies on the plate. Perhaps the best item on that plate was the roasted garlic peanut dipping sauce. Truly legendary on that item. Beer here has kind of not changed in many moons - same stuff for years, so maybe a new flavor or two will get that fifth star.  Sunsets are awesome too from here. Orange explosion.\\nUhhh,  afraid not. Another pretender in the sandwich world. Should have realized something was up when guy with a neck tattoo is making sandwiches, but it\\'s really about quality of ingredients as they say on their menu. \\nBreaking down my $7.95 sandwich called \"the Nectar\"  we run into various issues.\\n\\n- Turkey quality was slightly above Quizno\\'s (they use Genoa). It was that gelatin style turkey. If you want to be called the best sandwich, use real turkey. Lady also claimed that they \"maple glaze\" it themselves. I would like t\\no see that process because there was no hint of maple at all in the junky turkey.\\n\\n- Well, maybe they will use some \"Vermont\" cheddar right? Nope. Saw a tiny piece of cheddar cheese that was already pre-sliced and of very low quality. What a fraud of a place calling itself Vermont.. They should be embarrassed about the cheese situation.\\n\\n- \"Best\" sandwiches use homemade bread or at least some from a local bakery. This honey wheat bread came straight out of a bag.\\n\\n- Free samples of items are nice, but at least use a small cup when you hand stuff to me. The lady sticks a fork in the stuff and I have to attempt to get it in my mouth before it falls on the floor (caught the mac salad sample in my hand)\\n\\n- Macaroni Salad was good, fresh and homemade and was the highlight, but I wasn\\'t here for the side dish, I was here for a good sandwich and that did not materialize. If this is what people eat in Vermont, I do feel sorry for them.\\n\\nRESPONSE TO OWNER COMMENT:\\n- Well, the bread is still \"of\\nf the shelf\" and not baked in small batches\\n- Maple Flavor - not existent to any pallet. \\n-  You use Deli meat to make a profit and that is why you can put extra meat on a sandwich. Classic case of sacrificing quality for cash in your pocket.\\n- Vermont is known for Cheddar and the only connection you have to Vermont is your from there?. Use Vermont products and it shouldn\\'t matter if there is no mention that you use those products because Vermont is in your name. This was not an intelligent argument. \\n- Sample cups are for samples - nobody has heard of sample forks\\n- Hiring guys with arm tats is fine these days, but neck tattoos indicate a a higher level of felon or thug - aka someone who has to work in a sandwich shop - and doesn\\'t care about his job. It is not his fault, but it is just a bad image, unless all your employees have neck tats and ear rings.\\n- Nothing I said was lies, but you should rename your place \"Arizona sandwiches by people from Vermont\"\\nGreat drive, but most parts \\nrequire you to go 40 to 50mph, so it is hard to see scenery with a car on your tail the whole way. The first part is like that with mostly nice houses along the way, but it gets more scenic as you near Pinnacle Peak and beyond. Finally at the end, there is almost a 360 view of all the mountains which is a Kodak moment for sure. You can pull over in spots and take photos, so it\\'s not that bad, but might be better to go on a lazy weekend rather than a weekday like I did. Enjoy.\\nHad an amateur roller today. The veggie burrito is made big and I messed up the rolling process by getting mas rice, light beans and the roller could not handle the switch. It was knife and fork city upon my return home. Guacamole is still great and really makes the burrito slightly above average. Chicken is poor quality and not white meat and beef looked bad this visit (once every 6 months). Did you know that this month is the chain\\'s 20th birthday and the first one was in Denver, CO. Felt very safe as 8 cops wer', 'actual_label': 32, 'predicted_label': 32}, {'text': 'e also eating dinner as I was getting to go order. Line moved fast, but if you want chicken, try cafe Rio, much better.\\nI had thought this chain was the same as another bread chain which I disliked, but it is a separate chain with different items. I had an unusual choice of linguini pasta with chicken in a cream sauce. The dish needed more sauce, but the chicken was nice white meat strips and the pasta was cooked perfectly. The bread slices that came with the meal were tinged with garlic and tasted perfect with the pasta.; I added a salad for $1.29, but that was a mistake as it was all field greens. (i must have misheard the cashier). Not used to getting pasta at a sandwich place, but for 8 bucks, it would be something i would order again.\\nInteresting place. The event I attended there was no hassle or lines getting inside with my free e-ticket. Dos Equis had sponsored a soiree and the place was all jazzed up with strange food and a live band and attractive women handing out scorpion lo\\nllypops. I liked the little dark corners on one side of the front bar which was filled with Scottsdale type girls and some Dos Equis random people. The hall was quite large and the place was never crowded. Back-to-Back urinals was a new twist, but never experienced it on my two trips. Upstairs was VIP for some reason, but it just looked like a long balcony. Beer battered shrimp were good and free beer at the event was a plus. It was a nice venue.\\nBeen coming back here to watch various football games. They still have the best beer prices, especially if your drinking the beer of the month, which in November is a 25oz Bud for $4.00 Most Sunday\\'s, the place is scarily quiet for NFL games as I counted four people at the bar and one other person in the entire restaurant during the Cardinals game on Sunday.  They have a bunch of $5 appetizers on Sunday also, but the mozzarella sticks were not up to par and the sauce tasted a bit burnt. Otherwise, all the girls are nice and some are more talka\\ntive than others and the manager here is a good guy as well. Some new food items available, but wings are probably the safest item here still and maybe a burger.\\nAnother solid turkey sandwich and this places uses Boars Head and gives you three turkey flavor choices. All sandwiches include a pickle and your choice of sides. All the salads though are not homemade and come via Boars Head. Just pick the bag of chips to be safe. The signature sandwiches are about 8 bucks and those apparently include double the meat, but it really just looked like a normal sized sandwich. The make your own sandwich is a buck less. Very friendly sandwich maker and the bagels do appear to be boiled before baking, so that is a plus, except charging $1.10 for a bagel and then adding extra for a specialty bagel is a bit overpriced. All bagels should be 99 cents, crossing the dollar mark has gotten under my skin.\\nThanks to Lenny for reading my review and handling the situation properly. The employee in question in\\n my review was \"having a bad day\" and was going to quit the company soon. It is as good as an explanation as possible and he also added to his apology by offering me a $10 gift card, which I picked up at the store recently. Now, if they would just start carrying all the Captain Black cigar flavors again, things would be great. Either way, it is always good to be validated.\\nI have only had one dish here, but each time, including last night, it was delicous. It was the Singapore Rice Noodles, an item that can be hit and miss almost everywhere. These noodles are almost always served with a light curry flavor, but what was great about Koji is that they give you a no-curry option and I took advantage of that in a late night to-go order. The noodles were cooked perfectly and the chicken and shrimp and onions and peppers were cooked perfectly and tossed in the noodles. One of the top Singapore noodles dishes I have eaten. They also include a colorful red dipping sauce that can bring the heat \\nif you douse too much on there. No soy sauce should be used on these noodles. A side porder of steamed rice was only .50 cents which might be the best deal at the Orleans. Noodle up.\\nWhat a sad excuse for a chain that touts its football games and specials on Sunday. I walk into this place about 1:30pm on Sunday and the hostess has no idea who is playing or what is TV. The bar has one person and one table filled. Meanwhile, there are football banners and pennants everywhere promoting the NFL, but they apparently don\\'t carry the NFL package because only the nationally televised game was on their five TV\\'s. Even the staff is wearing football jersey\\'s - well there was a reason it was empty right smack in the middle of an NFL Sunday. What a pretender.\\nPretty much judging grocery stores on their chicken lately. This one has a good price at $5.99 for whole chickens when they are on sale. They also have pulled chicken sometimes in the deli area, but each tin is packed differently and not all c', 'actual_label': 32, 'predicted_label': 32}, {'text': 'ontain all breast meat, which is annoying to me. Safeway has never had great sandwich meat and they don\\'t use Boars Head, but there is a dude making sushi in there and he usually also offers samples. The self checkout lanes are usually always clear and the staff is almost always helpful as well. Redbox machine is also available. The parking lot needs to have cameras and more security as I was involved in a recent incident where video would have made a difference.\\nPrices here seem about $2 more than any other Thai place, but if the food matches up, then it can be overlooked for the most part. Wandered in for dinner about 9pm and very nice looking employee steered me towards the Singapore Noodles and I substituted chicken for BBQ Pork. This dish is an acquired taste because you have to like yellow curry for it to be effective. THe shrimp and chicken in the dish were both above average with the shrimp stealing the show. The curry flavor wasn\\'t as strong as in some other places which is a \\ngood thing and overall the dish was a pretty good rendition of the standard with better meat. It would be better for under $10 which is what most places (especially around UNLV) should be charging. Probably worth another visit though.\\nArrived here before the lunch crowd did, but even at 11:15 am that parking lot was almost full. The only really good thing about the sandwich was the bread - the 12 grain was thick and hearty and you can taste the seeds, but the bread was all I tasted because Sack\\'s hardly put any turkey on my sandwich named the Symphony. It did have a heck of alot of sprouts, some cream cheese, a small amount of bacon and avocado. Could have been legendary with the proper ingredients and portion size, but alas it was nothing special, but nothing bad either. Just a forgettable sandwich with decent bread. The cookie says Wanda made it, but it seemed more like Entennman\\'s and the sandwich was too small for it\\'s $7 price tag. Turkey quality also needed upgrading. Place seeme\\nd more like a factory than really caring about your food. Bite Me subs is better.\\nEncountered a very rude female employee during today\\'s visit. Things didn\\'t end well as I had to put her into her place with a rude farewell comment. This is an Indian place, so I need a discount to shop in this store and the cigar holder said two cigars for $1.09, but the package says $1.49. Of course this chick never went around to check my claim, just demanded I pay $1.49. That is when things went downhill and since I know I was right, I don;\\'t feel any regrets in letting her have a piece of my mind.\\nOnly three other people in this theatre for the early showing of Two Guns. It was $5.50. Surprised at the setup, but this would clearly stink if all 30 seats in the tiny place were full. Great sound system and the reclining seats are nice, but if crowded you wouldn\\'t be able to put your feet on the seat in front. Did not like or need the teenage employee getting in front of the crowd before the show and ma\\nke a speech about \"i\\'m your host, enjoy the show, turn your cell phone off\" Nobody listens anyway, but less of a chance of an idiot or two at a matineee. Nobody drinks coffee in the AM either because half the snack bars were closed.\\nIt took them a bit longer than I would have liked to reopen Hayden during the floods today. I do not think they were prepared and BTW how long is it gonna take to fix Thomas. I think it\\'s been decades to do some simple landscaping/water pipe stuff and they are about to waste more money fixing/beautifying McDowell. I guess since it was a 100 year flood, I can give them a break, but I had to go down to Indian School to cross Hayden. I also have a beef with all those campaign signs - what the hell are the rules for those things. They are every freakin corner and most are negative stuff too, no positive messages. Get some regulations in place.\\nJust attended the Taco bash. Got there two hours after opening and it was already crowded. Most tents had hardly any ro\\nom in them to just hang out, but you could find your niche if you tried hard enough. There were lines for most things, but it wasn\\'t a long wait for anything and that included ID check, tickets and getting a beer. Some taco places did have rather long lines, but you could also find many that did not have those lines. They had wrestling and some lame bands, but the crowd was mellow and friendly as we met some new friends in the drinking/tent zones. As for tacos, I had one bad one from manuel\\'s and two good chicken ones from familiar places in the valley, like Salty Senorita. Half-priced admission tickets helped the cause as all drinks were 6 bucks each, but true to their word, all tacos were 2 bucks. People were still streaming in at 4pm, so crowds are the only real issue, but today it wasn\\'t scorching hot and you could find room to be away from crowds too if you wanted. Pretty good festival.\\nAnother quality Italian place out in Gilbert. Seems like this is where most New Yorkers end up ', 'actual_label': 32, 'predicted_label': 32}, {'text': \"moving too or opening restaurants. The bar had all sorts of Yankees and Bronx items hanging, so I knew I might be in for a good meal. It was better than good and the bill for a totally filling lunch was just over 6 bucks minus a tip. The meatballs are all ground beef (that's what I like) and they were buried in a great 6 inch roll topped with plenty of cheese and marinara sauce. The surprise was the complimentary garlic knots served pre-meal and those were doughy and garlickly as expected to find in a real NY place. It wasn't too crowded at about 1pm on a recent weekday and although I did not get greeted like family, everybody I came in contact with (1 bartender) was nice. So, if your looking for NY in AZ, this is a top place to go and I'm from NY, so trust me.\\nWow, the menu is tiny and the prices are absurd and several dishes don't even offer rice and/or beans with the entree. My $14 Chili Relleno had no sides and one small relleno, which actually was pretty good. Others at the table \\nended up ordering off the kids menu (ask) because there was almost nothing worthy of ordering. We should have left when we saw the menu, but I was overruled. The patio is a nice place to sit. \\n  They don't use white meat - it's mixed\\nSpecialty drinks were Ok...try the prickly pear pina colada\\nGuacamole - should be made tableside, but this and the chips were good\\n$27 for chicken enchiladas was way too high, even for Vegas. Basically, this is high end (without the quality) Mexican food. Try Hussong's for a better experience.\\nVery good tacos would be a good way to start this review. They have alot of them in all forms available and whatever protein you can think of also. They also have American food like burgers, but this is a Mexican joint right? Came here before the ASU game and the bar was pretty full, it's a long ass bar for sure. Post happy hour, but Bud light was just $3 bottle and the chips were free (unlimited) and the salsa was very fresh, bursting with jalapeno's and finely chop\\nped tomatoes (a real salsa). The tacos that caught my attention were the award winning crispy tacos that comes with two sides for $11. A bit pricey, but the tacos were loaded with shredded beef, slices of avocado, mexican cheese and other condiments and the crispy shells were super crispy and had a great crunch. The side dishes were good too, pretty good Mexican rice and something called Smashed Potatoes, which were two giant chunks of crunchy taters that could be smashed I guess with your own fork. Either way, it worked with the white dipping sauce (version of ranch?).\\n   The only problem with two tacos for $11 is that on the way out I saw  a flyer for $2 taco tuesday which is way cheaper than my dinner, but i doubt they use the crispy shell on those guys. Still sounds like a great deal.\\nThe chicken noodle soup is something you should avoid. It is more like a stew with bad ingredients, overcooked noodles, fatty pieces of cubed chicken and an off deep yellow color. The strawberry smoot\\nhie was drinkable and props to the cashier who spotted me an extra cookie after forgetting to bring the original cookie to my table. Based on this visit, I will stick to brownie and salads at this chain. The cookie was not impressive either as all it tasted like was butter.\\nSteered away from the Italian food and went with the Boars Head Turkey and Provolone on a Seeded Roll. It was a foot long and only $6.95. Great value and good ingredients. This though is about the Boars Head turkey. Everything else can be found anywhere and I don't think they are baking the bread, but it is good lunch value. The macaroni salad side for 2 bucks had too much mayo and not enough veggies. Always a nice staff. Back to the Italian food next time.\\nArrived here while the place was mostly empty about 7pm on a Wednesday night and that is a good thing. Around 10pm when I was leaving, it was semi-crowded and the usual younger crowd had taken over and surrounded by seat at the bar. Luckily, I didn't notice much \\nafter taking advantage of the Wednesday $6 can of bud light and shot of whiskey deal. That is a large savings for a scottsdale bar. Never heard of the brand of whiskey, but it had some dude's name on it so it was decent and actually went down smooth. They also had a $9 rack of spare ribs deal which I considered, but went with the five chicken breast tacos for 12 bucks, served on the trademark cutting board. Everything was non-greasy, non-mexican style and more upscale tacos, but loaded with chicken and toppings. A country band (it was country night) appeared about 9pm and they were playing decent music as I sipped my whiskey and enjoyed the evening breezes. Most of the place is outside and I would also call it a semi-sports bar as the TV's are pretty good at the bar. A few hipster bartenders too if your into that thing.\\nWent inside on Saturday morning and ordered the Country Breakfast burrito. I added rice to the potatoes, cheese and eggs and my total was about 6 bucks for a very large\", 'actual_label': 32, 'predicted_label': 32}, {'text': \" breakfast which half the burro is still sitting in frig. Everything seemed freshly made to order and the ingredients all tasted nice. With no meat inside, it was hard to mess this burrito up, so it was a nice, no worry about what is inside my breakfast. Extra points for free chips on the counter and a decent green sauce was served on the side, more thick than than normal. Great radish and cucumbers as well.\\nRandom lunch stop and went for the usual chicken pad thai as I dined in the empty restaurant near the end of the lunchtime period. Only $6.95 for the entree and a crispy spring roll. The pad thai was a good version with bean sprouts, white chicken and some crushed peanuts hanging out on the side of the plate (maybe some more?). Their twist is the four pack of sauces that they give you when the entree arrives. One was a yellow powder that was supposed to be fiery and another was also a hot sauce, both of which I had to avoid, but good for hot food fans. I did try the light red sauce\\n that was was kind of sweet and hot and added some flavor gringo style. Can't beat the service either when your the only one in the place.\\nThe happy Hour food has gone up in price. It is now 4 bucks for those decent mozzarella sticks. They still have the same beer draft prices though, but they turned over their whole management team and it's not the same vibe.\\nHappy Hour scam alert again. The bruchetta deal is a blatant ripoff. It was 5 bucks, but the portion was half as big as normal and even that portion was a joke. The menu said mozzarella cheese, but the chef chose to cut a sliver of cheese on top of each 1/8th inch slice. See photos. We were only one of about six folks in the place and they at least could have improved on that appetizer choice. The Guiness was about four bucks, so at least that was a good deal.\\nRandom stop this AM as I saw the door wide open and they had decent breakfast deals. Ordered the small egg, bacon and cheese on an Italian roll for under $3. This was a dec\\nent breakfast sandwich, eggs were freshly made, bacon was a bit dated, but cheese melted nicely. The bread was the best part overall and it was a different way to start the day, which is exactly what I was seeking today.\\nHow dare they put rye seeds on an everything bagel? I'm not happy about dealing with that party foul at all or the rude, inefficient service. Plus, even though they are boiled here, these are not good bagels at all,  even if the rye seeds were not present. Other issue is the bagel bins are far away from customers eyes - what are hiding - put the bins up front like every true NY bagel shop. Hey, if your gonna call yourself a NY bagel place (yes I am from NY) then I want the whole experience. Charging $11 for a turkey sandwich is a bit much too and this is an unfriendly, cold location with no charm. There was a very hairy bird outside though looking for crumbs and on this day that bird got lucky. Onto the next place.\\nFirst off, I need to give credit to the great counterg\\nuy who made my first visit here very nice. There was a big line to order as i entered, so i decided to grab a menu and call something in, but the counterguy just took my order at the front pick-up counter instead and 15 minutes later I was out the door with my chicken parmesan dinner order valued at about 11 bucks. The small salad had alot of tomato wedges, a few purple onion rings and some romaine lettuce - nothing memorable, but the garlic bread was quite good.\\n     I have a long history of eating chicken parm and it is just about my fav dish, but this wasn't a great version, in fact it was unusual to a point that it reminded me of a dinner you would get from a college pizzeria. The chicken was sliced and barely breaded and the sauce really didn't have any taste (needed oregeno or garlic or something). If your making chicken parm, you take a breast of chicken, bread it, fry it and then you serve it to me. Never has the chicken been pre-sliced before - totally not authentic. For me, i\\nt's about the crunchy breading. The pasta in the dish was good, but overall it also needed more mozzarella cheese as well.\\n      Will likely return to try something else and the pizza looked good, but skip the chicken parm if you value tradition.\\nThree stars is about the max for this state fair. Not a fan of being upcharged for attractions once you already have entered the fair. We did pay a buck each to see the giant Alligator in the trailer. It is there every year. It was only two bucks to ener fair on a Saturday\\nLots of junk this year - Monster Trucks, but only a watered down boring version\\nJurassic park - fake reptiles, good for about 5 minutes\\nFood Exhibit - terrible\\n\\n38 new fried foods - probably, but the ones you want are hard to find.

Also had a good stuffed baked potato and a refreshing fresh squeezed lemonade and frozen cheesecake doused in chocolate.\\nMust be a new guy cooking or they just don't do the cheesesteak cons\", 'actual_label': 32, 'predicted_label': 32}, {'text': \"istently. Grabbing my free bday sandwich today, the food came out totally different than my last visit. On that visit, the cheese was properly folded into the meat, but today chef lazybones just put two slices of cheese unmelted on the bread and ladled the meat on top of the cheese. Totally different taste, but it was free, so had to let it go. Maybe next time, real chef will return.\\nNothing wrong with this Philly Cheesesteak. Overall everything good at this outpost of the chain. The appetizers had some potential with a decent version of coconut shrimp and potstickers. The spinach dip could use some help though. The sandwich was packed with ribeye steak, onions, peppers and provolone cheese. It came (for 99 cents extra) with a loaded baked potato and that too had a good amount of cheese and bacon. Food is usually reliable at this chain.\\nWell since my visiting cousin had to eat kosher we checked out this joint down in Phoenix. The dining room was empty at 5:30 and it is not a cozy spot \\neither, kind of cluttered and unfriendly. The prices for some food are a bit high including my $15 chicken stir fry, which consisted of a few veggies (some overcooked) and some below average chicken in a strange light peanut sauce with white rice. My cousin's double burger ($13) was a normal burger as far as I could tell.\\n  My major issues at this place include not much made fresh as they feature frozen falafel and deli-sliced Corned Beef and pastrami. I think there is a big difference between kosher places and places that serve Jewish food like Chompie's, plus Phoenix has about three Kosher restaurants, so it is not an area of food that gets much love in the valley. Good thing my cousin picked up the bill.\\nOk, I admit that i thought this actually was a real farmer's market, but even though it isn't, it really is one. The reason why I felt that way is because I purchased goat cheese - the form of cheese that only looks correct at a farmer's market. They had some crazy goat cheese combo\\ns and I ended up with spinach and pumpkin seeds. Other good items spotted were Tamale factory tamales, a really good brownie from Fairytale bakery, parsley pita chips and fresh fruit. Both employees were really nice, one guy following me outside making sure my box was good enough for my groceries. When you check out, they ask box or plastic. I was feeling crazy, so I chose box.  Open til 11pm and it does have a more gourmet feel than any other bodega's around town. Try finding goat cheese at a grocery store with bars on it.\\nProbably the worst Chicken Parmesan sandwich ever and even worse chips. It was the Monday $5 special and it was far from special. They had no hostess which already is a big problem at the door. Only one guy working the bar, waiting tables and taking to-go orders. Either this guy is too cheap to hire staff or he expects nobody to show up during lunch (and it wasn't that crowded, so that may be it). The sandwich consisted of one piece of chicken, but it was not breade\\nd at akll and half the breast had a fatty, tough end that was inedible. The bread was not toasted and tasted like the day's delivery of bread had not arrived yet. It could not be eaten. The housemade chips may have been housemade, but they may have been made a week ago. They were off tasting and over seasoned and overcooked and burnt. Just a nasty meal overall, well it wasn't really a meal because it was barely eaten. This place is a huge disappointment and embarrassment to Italian food and italian food lovers everywhere. \\nNote to guy sitting at at bar: Nobody in the history of eating a sandwich has ever used a knife and fork to eat one. Customers at this place are bad too. Disaster.\\nThe options for discounts at the fair are endless. I took advantage of Foodie Fridays, which is half-price admission and also $2 food and drink items and also $2 rides I believe. If your looking to save money and sample lots of stuff, this is the way to go. Each vendor (about 100) has three items for $2 ea\\nch, some are half-size portions, but most are full size. The list is endless and its tough to find everything on the map, but if you walk around each vendor has alist posted. There si one Friday left. I ended up with glazed pecans, hot cinnamon rol, roasted corn, lemonade, pineapple whip cone and Indian fry bread with beans and cheese. Total was $12 and only $5 for discounted pparking. The monkeys were cool to see for a $1 extra and giant mechanical bugs in the coliseum are strange looking too. This was strictly a daytime visit as Foodie Friday runs from 12-6, but its a great idea. Deep Fried Butter and Deep Fried Bubblegum were strange as was deep fried fruity pebbles.\\nNot a great crowd for Monday Night Football, not that it matters. It does appear that they overcharged my card as I look at my statement this morning. I paid $11.87 and left a cash tip, so why is my card charged over 14 bucks. Will update after I call later today. The beer prices during happy Hour are good as domestic b\", 'actual_label': 32, 'predicted_label': 32}, {'text': \"ottles are only $2.50. They have about 6 items discounted about 3 or 4 bucks on the food menu. It's none of their A list appetizers as another bar is trying to force us to eat only what they want to serve us during happy Hour. The brushetta that i ordered was a good version, but nothing great. It was overloaded with tomatoes and the bread had melted mozzarella cheese (which was cold). For 6 bucks, it was about 2 bucks overpriced. The blonde bartender was attractive, but had no personality to make me want to come back or stay longer.\\nWas here for a quick 2 hour Happy Hour thingy. The patio is great with lots of tables and a firepit in the corner. They have a special happy Hour menu, but watch out for the Brushetta part. The prices at $3 are attractive, but they are only giving you $3 worth of food, not a Happy Hour deal or anything. The pumpkin/Hazelnut cheese concoction wasn't even good, moreorless worth the $3 it cost for one slice of bread cut up into three pieces. Are you really tha\\nt freakin cheap people? It was unhappy Hour in terms of food, but they had AZ craft beers for $5 at HH and although that isn't a great deal, it's the best you can find in this upscale happy hour, which should be renamed. Waitress was nice and staff was polite, but also an aging crowd was hanging out at the bar if your into grey, then head that way.\\nTry the cookies for 50 cents each - they are big and tasty. Chocolate Chip of course. Wandered into this store, knowing that of course, it is overpriced and kinda like Whole Foods. They have way more items at Whole Foods in the grab and go category, but most other things seem equal. Made it out of there with a nice Chicken Breast for 4 bucks, some rice with pinenuts and thick corn tortillas. I pretty much went through every aisle and unless you really don't care about money, it will be hard to justify buying some items at those prices. The $9 box of cookies, the $8 jar of salsa, the $10 oatmeal concoction, etc. Well, either way, buy what you\\n can afford cause some products are unique. The dinner I had turned out good and the cookies were the best part for desert.\\nNever heard of the guy who owns the place, but stopped in just before their happy Hour ended (3-6pm). After HH, you will pay through the nose for cocktails (except beer). Lots of flies outside this time of year, so would be better to sit inside. The place is smaller than it appears on the outside, but has a nice wrap-a-round bar that was almost full on happy Hour. They have nine appetizers, but only like 3 of them are on special. Tried the shot and a beer deal for 5 bucks (normally $9). One shot of blueberry moonshine and half a beer of Blue Moon (five other choices available). It was a sweet choice, but had to try the moonshine whisky in a whisky bar right? The servers are obviously the best part - Scottsdale's finest decked out in incredibly tight shorts and half shirts and all under 25 years old. Tough to swallow when your date is nearly double their age. Seems\\n like a nice place for future daytime drinking, just wish the HH would go to 7pm.\\nThe prices are about three bucks lower at this location than other AMC theaters. I believe we paid $6.99 each for a night movie and a matinee would only be five bucks. The place was pretty empty on a recent weeknight and that was good, but no fresh popcorn was sighted, so we had to pass on that treat. Everything else was pretty good once inside including the reclining seats. Must be college pricing here in Tempe, but anybody can partake in the bargain deals.\\nWas getting a car smogged and found this place using Yelp. When I first moved here, this BBQ place was Honey Bears, but I guess they left years ago. Now, although I have no idea how long it has been here, but Hap's is certainly a good BBQ joint. The cook or owner said it was St. Louis style, but Baltimore is actually more famous for their pit bbq as well. The only two things we tried were sliced brisket ($8) and chopped brisket and both were Tennessee\\n style topped with coleslaw for 99 cents extra. The sandwiches do not come with a side as normal. My chopped brisket was great as it had no fat at all and house bbq sauce was light and pleasant. The slaw was a vinegary mix and finely chopped, so it added a great crunch. You can order the sliced brisket fatty or lean and that also was well enjoyed. The place is kinda in the semi-hood, but most great bbq joints in the USA are also located in shady areas, so go check it out.\\nVery simple standard for basic Chinese. If the Veggie Rice does not contain frozen peas and carrots, then we are in business. This place came through, so its off to a good start. Onions, broccoli and chopped mushrooms were found in this pint of rice at about 5 bucks. Might not try anything else, but go for the rice if you get a chance. Don't think this is true NY Chinese though because I did not see Cold Sesame Noodles in play and that is a key appetizer in all NY joints. Lunch specials at $5.99 might be worthy at som\", 'actual_label': 32, 'predicted_label': 32}, {'text': 'e point.\\nBeen here a few times now. Tried the Happy Hour Chicken Quesadilla and it wasn\\'t that impressive. Green peppers were located inside the tortilla, along with way too much chicken that wasn\\'t that tasty at all. The salsa also had no flavor. Not too bad on drink prices as it was about $5 for a can of Guiness and $7 for a Mixed Drink. Since this place is a Vegas icon, it is worth stopping in to check out the firepits and some of their \"girly\" drinks are pretty famous as well. Entrees are expensive and you can only get appetizers at the bar area. The deserts are not homemade, but the carrot cake was a decent rendition. Worth the trip to see what life was like back in the Vegas glory days (AKA before the Ferris Wheels started arriving in town).\\nNot a good night for this place. \\nGreek salad side - brown wilting lettuce, soggy salad mess overall\\nFalafel - terrible. overspiced, grainy tasting and bad mouth feel\\nFalafel sandwich - poorly constructed with watery tzatki sauce, brown lettu\\nce.\\n\\nPlus, in most of their chicken gyro\\'s, they use mixed dark and white meat. Better to ask. Way better places out there. Since my last visit, something happened. Not good.\\nOnly tried two items here, but i do like the fact that they offer a small size of entrees as well as large size. You can tell alot about a place by their fried rice. The vegetable fried rice was excellent with fresh cut mushrooms and other veggies and not just frozen peas and carrots. The $1.25 egg roll was not good though, although perhaps they gave me a spring roll instead because the wrapper was not egg roll style. Could possibly try the real food here at some point, but rice was a good start.\\nBeen wanting to try this place for awhile and finally got here for a 2pm lunch last week. This is usually the time staff is eating, etc and it was just the case on this day as well. The food is well priced and served up in big portions. The short rib was extra cooked from probably sitting in the bin for awhile, but luckil\\ny I enjoy extra cooked and slightly dry beef so it worked out well for me. The chicken was a runner-up to the beef, but I should have tried the cornbread. If you go crazy with toppings and sauces (which you will on your first visit like I did) then everything gets lost under all the different flavors. I would skip the half flour and half corn and go for the corn tortilla and be gentle on the sauces, but this is a place I will return too at some point if I\"m in the area.\\nMostly good results, but screwing up the $3.50 side of breakfast potatoes was a big deal in my mind. It was a small portion of fried potatoes, but over half of the spuds were not cooked. This seems to be a simple problem to overcome if the cook would taste his food. No time to return them due to busy day that day. The rest of the food was good, not great.\\nShort stack of Hawaiian pancakes - loaded with pineapple, topped with coconut and came with it\\'s own sweet syrup. These were good, a new twist.\\nThe bacon omelette was \\nfine, nothing superb and the coffee situation was great. My coffee cup was always full. This place falls just outside my Big 4 Scottsdale breakfast eateries.\\nWas here for a singles event. Kind of a skinny setup, but it was crowded, so tough to move around. Patio is small in the back, but bigger in front. Huge bar and fair drink prices on this Saturday night - only 4 bucks for a Dos Equis from ole beer bucket gal. Jello shot girl passed me about ten times, but never asked if i wanted a shot. Free chips and triple salsa. Green was hotter than the red in this case and pico de gallo is always a safe choice.\\nNot at all impressed with the food at this dive. Was needing some baby back ribs and this joint was close enough to give it a try. It\\'s a large menu for a small place with fried chicken, BBQ stuff, hot dogs and fish fry. On the saturday afternoon, I sauntered inside, the owner\\'s mom was the only customer and she was enjoying something deep fried. I did order the 1/2 rack of ribs for $12\\n, plus a side and drink for $3 more. When the nice owner opened my takeout box for a preview, the ribs clearly did not look like Baby backs, but instead were short and stubby and clearly looked like St. Louis style. After a brief 5 minute discussion, this lady started laying out the \"nice\" lies saying things like well, these are short ribs and are still baby backs, but are from this place on the cow. Now, it\\'s not my first time eating ribs, but I did cut her a break since she was the expert and I needed to get back for kickoff. Bottom line: she lied. The ribs are too thick to be baby back, the sauce was way too sweet, the sweet tea wasn\\'t sweet at all and $15 bucks went out the window pretty fast. The ribs (see photo) were fatty and the meat did not fall off the short bone either. \\nThe only redeeming quality for me on this visit was my choice of side dish. The candied yams were outstanding and a good size side dish.

We skipped the Starters, Vegetarian, Kabob Platters directly to the SPECIAL Dishes.  We were still served with Afghani Flat Bread which was nice as we were starving.\\n\\nMy co-worker had the Tika Platter($9.49) where he choose Beef Tenderloin KABOB served with Salata, Yoghurt Sauce and Qabali.  \\n\\nQabali reminds me of Jewel Rice during my Persian dinner at Pomegranate.  Actually the whole dish reminds me of Persian food, I hope this doesn't offend anyone as it is just my ROOKIE\\n comparison to this culture I'm still learning.  Please feel free to message me if I'm totally off track.\\n\\nI got the Combination Platter($11.49) choice of Koobideh(Ground Beef) with any other Kabob which I got the Chopan(Lamb) served with Qabali and Salata.  The Qabali was YUMMY and large portion.  Chopan & Koobideh was good and so was the Salata where the hint of Coriander made the difference.\\n\\nOur waitress did her work well and the setting is pretty comfy with nice CUSHY seats.  I believe this could be a nice date place for a night if you're bored of the Italian scene in this neighbourhood.\\nKenly's Noodle?  I didn't spell it wrong, this is NOT Kenny's Noodle but it has that similar concept however it still adopts the previous business's concept of Cantonese Fast Food/Cafe/Restaurant and you'll even notice the Desserts they offer are the same as the Restaurant in this same spot before.  I guess what I'm really saying is that little has changed here.   2.5 *Star*\\n\\nThe space has incorpo\\nrate a few more TINY booth seating but it simply looks awkward and it'll probably make it less convenient for everyone if this place ever gets busy.  Yup, as I watched Fairchild TV 8 pm show, I decided on either the Clam cooked in Wine with Noodle Soup($6.99) or the House Special Kenly's Big Bowl Noodle Soup($5.99).\\n\\nBig Bowl Noodle Soup came with a complimentary Hot Drink.  This dish is essentially the Hong Kong Cart Noodle served in a Large Bowl.  Crispy Fish Skin, Tendon, Beef, Pig Feet, Beef Ball, Fish Ball, Wonton, Shrimp Dumpling, and Greens served on Egg Noodles in a Wonton/Beef Stock.\\n\\nThe Noodles are fine and the Broth was actually good as the Beef side of things gave it a sweetness to the typical Wonton salty Stock.  Most ingredients are the A-OK scale however the Pig Feet wasn't tender enough which means I won't be coming back for Pig Feet with Guilin Noodles.\\n\\nBy 8:30 pm, the Kitchen staff were out here joining me in watching Television and eating their Dinner.  It's always\\n funny how most of us will ask for the Bill when 9:00 pm comes around exactly when the TV show ends.\\nMaybe it's a Feng Shui thing for me, while I enjoy the Te Aro brand Cappuccino but as I sat on that comfy Leather Sofa the bright light from the outdoors made me look like a Deer caught in Headlights.

Sounds like I hate sunlight, doesn't it? LOL  \\n\\nOkay, If I give Te Aro 4 *Star* when I look at the bottom of the cup for Crema, Rooster Coffee deserves 3.5 *Star* or slightly higher 3.75(?).  It still has that distinct Te Aro flavour everybody loves.\\nIf you happen to travel to this area and see the plazas that reside at Morningside & Milner, you wouldn't have noticed them few years prior.

Although\", 'actual_label': 33, 'predicted_label': 33}, {'text': \" it's not a destination area, it's still better than the wasteland it was before.\\n\\nAll that said, it was a nice time to revisit this area and find a few places worth my time to explore.  What a Bakery is one place that looked hospitable and I was searching for Dessert anyways as a prior lunch-buddy suggested.  It's a family small business so they close on Mondays.  What is recognizable in this spacious limited seating Bakery is the La Rocca brand Cakes in the displays.\\n\\nThere was a few Bread items in one corner while what they do onsite are the smaller items such as Cookies, Brownies, Tarts, Strudels, and Savoury(Meat) Phyllo items was an interesting item to find here.  I am now finding out that the 2 varieties of Coconut Tarts use a Phyllo crust as well rather than Pie crust.  Also found out why the Tarts don't SIT up straight(see photo).\\n\\nI had the Banana Bread PUDDING($1.50) which was warmed up for me as it was my first time having Banana Bread Pudding which has that Banana Bread cr\\nust and an interior of dense but Ripe Banana flavour.  For that price, I'm quite happy to have learned that Banana Bread can be escalated to another format.  Not much here in terms of Drinks aside from Coffee/Tea which are the normal drink of choice anyways.\\nWe just arrived in the NICK of time.  In time to visit the Farm/Winery Store and the Gentleman that greeted us while we were browsing at the Lobby with all the Holiday/Farm decorations.  Just be careful of the Tractors lying around but if you have Children, I'm sure those Biped Tractor Cycles will keep them entertained while you Schmooze & Booze in the Store area farther inside.\\n\\nChristmas Eve we were there to say Happy Holidays to the fellow before they close shop until the month of May.  He was happy to oblige with any Tasting Request we had while we browsed through the shop notibly of Apple Cider, Mulled Spices, Fruit Beers, Apple Chips and such.  Yes, most of the items even the Wine will have Fruit themed simply because you're \\nin a Fruit Farm.\\n\\nCan't wait until they open to try some more.  Especially the Meade and some more of their Award Winning Fruit Wines and I don't even have to drive an hour to get to Applewood.  That time it'll probably be some PICKING time.\\n\\nTastings:\\n\\nSmoke'in Apple(Iced Cider with Hot Chillies & Pepper Corns)\\n- Not your everyday Beverage but as noted it's a good item to cook with.  I was thinking of a juicy thick Pork Chop while I was drinking.\\n\\nIced Cider(Soft Sweet Vanilla Spice Nose (18))\\n- Interesting the preparation of this is similar to Grapes but needs much lower temperature prior to picking.  Somewhere in the neighbourhood of -20 rather than -10 which seems quite a task.\\nI come here when I'm just a LITTLE thirsty & I feel for something HEALTHY.  A little thirsty simply because for less than a couple bucks you can have a cup of their Famous Soya Milk but don't expect a bucket full, you ONLY paid a couple bucks after all.\\n\\nAt certain times of the day, they will have Daily Comb\\nination Specials that pair their snack food with a drink which is a good snack option.  I usually go with the Fried Noodle the ones where you've seen it at Dim Sum places. \\n\\nDid I mention SNACK?  It's snack portions of course but most combinations are under $5.00 so if you don't want to spoil your dinner and want something Healthy and Lactose-Free then give it a try.\\n\\nMaybe it's psychological, but I sometimes can taste the plastic when I have Soy Milk from the typical grocery store packaging.  Yan Woo Soy feels much cleaner and fresher.\\nI looked around for a Golf Driving Range as I drove along Islington and I came to a red light and noticed a PLAYGROUND of sorts at the corner of Rutherford & Islington.  I looked again and it turned out to be an Outdoor Mini Putt Course in a playful playground setting.\\n\\nI walked up to the Gazebo and and as I walked inside I noticed a patio tent just outside.  Inside is where you can rent Golf Clubs($2.00) while other places I can rent for free but I usu\\nally cannot get a Callaway Big Bertha from those other places.  I noticed a few more Patio chairs inside. I got a token from the nonchalant staff as I purchased a small bucket($8.00).\\n\\nOn the left half was the Grass Tees and on the right was the Artificial Tees.  The range overlooks Islington ave. on the left and a forest/grass area on the right.  There was even a DENTED trunk in the middle of the course for those that have decent aim.  \\n\\nUnlike the other places I noticed there are no benches or sitting area just behind the Tees, simply standing room only.  The Mini-Putt area had a School Bus with a slide on it.  I would be super excited IF I was a 5 year old.  At least the kids won't be bored sitting around.\\nAnnyeonghaseyo,\\n\\nKorean Harvest Festival - September 17 & 18, 2011\\n\\nMel Lastman Square has held plenty of Cultural Festivities and the Korean Harvest Festival fits right in, especially near a neighbourhood with many Korean Families.

Soup is a whole chapter on it's own in the Culinary textbooks where you have Broths, Consomme, Vegetable Soups, Other Clear Soups, Puree, Bisque, Chowders.  I was pretty excited back when Soup Nazi arrived in Toronto in the form of Original SoupMan at the Eaton Centre back i\\nn my time.\\n\\nIt's been awhile since that time and SoupMan no longer exist but there's still Soup lovers everywhere in GTA.  Unfortunately for Ravi, I've had time to learn, taste, experience my way through some Soups since then and now I am giving Ravi Soups A-OK...\\n\\nPorcini Mushroom Bisque with Wild Rice, Shallots and Truffle Oil($8.99) is something I have had before and it tasted just as GOOD with that depth of Mushroom and the almighty magic of Black Truffle Oil drizzle.  The portion was nice as a light meal and came with a Biscuit for an appetizer.  Priced right in terms of profit margin and white collar business people as patrons.\\n\\nI'm glad Ravi is around as a Soup-only spot and show that Soup is in itself a Culinary Art that seems simple but can be as complicated as you need however to the normal citizen, all you really have to do is just sip your Soup and feel comforted.  It is just that SIMPLE.\\nThe Chinese name makes it an indication that it has changed ownership as a previous re\\nview stated, however if you don't read Chinese then you would think nothing has changed since the English business name stays Fisherman Villa.  I've been here for Dim Sum during Summer and believe it was priced $1.80 during those special hours. It was A-OK however this review is about a Dinner Meal. \\n\\nAbsolutely love that LCD overhead as we watched HK show while making our order. There are promotions, house special items on Menu  all of the typical Cantonese Cuisine.\\n\\nBuddha Jumps Over Wall($13.99) -  Advertised as specialty item they're known for and it is for an individual portion. I haven't had this Cantonese delicacy for quite awhile now but from last I remembered, it is fine the way it is. 1 one-bite Abalone, sliver of Shark Fin, Shitake Mushroom, Silk Chicken, Dried Scallop and a few more items in Broth.\\n\\nCrispy Pigeon($15.99) - Also on that same specialty advertisement. It was crispy like Peking Duck and the meat was marinaded to umami salty savouriness already that you don't ne\\ned additional Salt/Pepper or Worcestershire Sauce dipping. Best part of course is always the HEAD/neck piece, very crunchy. \\n\\nComplimentary Soup appetizer and Red Bean Soup dessert is standard. Appetizer Soup refills are available upon request as the server asked us if we wish for more. Don't expect facial expressions but for some weird reason the service was nice this time.  Changed our plates, lots of Teapot refills.  Fisherman Villa is A-OK.\\nQ:  How do you follow-up from Au-Pied-de-Cochon dinner 30 minutes ago?\\n\\nA:                                        Au Cinquième Péché\\n                                              -=[The Fifth Sin]=-\\n\\n                                             otherwise known as...\\n \\n                                                  ~GLUTTONY~\\n\\n                                       55555     55{3.5}55     55555                      \\n\\nAu 5ième Péché continues the pleasantness of wonderful services in Montreal.\\nTruly unexpected to the point of skepticism prior t\\no the Joy of being served upon.\\nBeyond knowledgeable, absolutely charming, English bilingual service everywhere.\\nProfessionalism that leaves my Hometown service staff something to be desired.\\n\\nSaumon fumé Minute (Minute Smoked Salmon)\\n\\nClean and simplistic with added sensory playfulness in presentation.\\nFusion in concept, bringing Japanese elements to a Canadian classic.\\nLight scent of Smoke permeates from metallic contraption to our noses.\\nSashimi, both visually and texturally with essense of Smoked Salmon.\\n\\nRis de Veau (Veal Sweetbread)\\n\\nNoteable as the Chef's Piece de Resistance we forego the Canard dish.\\nThe Sweetbread itself is fried to the classic technical specifications.\\nIt relies on the crisp Pancetta as textural contrast support to the softness.\\nThe sweated Vegetation beneath was delicious enough to stand on it's own.\\nObservation alone reminds me of styles from the American South.\\n\\nCheesecake aux Pruneaux (Cheesecake with Prunes)\\n\\nYou've read correctly, Prunes!

Yeah~\\nThe younger staff behind the counter probably remembered me as he came over to my end of the counter to greet me. I\\'m pretty easy to remember as I\\'m probably the only Chinese to step inside the TAKE-OUT Sri Lankan shop within the last Month or two. I was there the last time pointing my ass off at the photos outside but it was after 3 pm, which is when they stop serving the Lamprais that they display in photos along the outside of the store.\\n\\nI asked him what was good and he said Biryani(Fried Rice) but I was still Lamprais-oriented so I asked for the Chicken Lamprais and waited on the side in this typical Sri Lankan Take-out setup(i.e. Babu). There was no Menu or Menu-bo\\nards available so just go in be adventurous and start asking or bring a friend of Sri Lankan/Indian origins. \\n\\nChicken Lamprais($7.50) came out in a plastic bag and must have weighed 2lbs and not something you can eat in the car unless you\\'re ready to make a mess with your right(!) hand and give your car that new Curry perfume! Unwrap the Newspaper, Butcher Paper, Banana Leaf to discover the mother-load. \\n\\nI\\'m sure if you\\'re a Yelp Toronto user, you\\'ll know about Hopper Hut Lamprais so I won\\'t go indepth. As my comparison to HH Lamprais, this one when opened had more distinct segregation of each Curry element which is nice to see instead of making educated guesses. What I didn\\'t like as much was that the whole dish tasted a bit wet/loose possibly the Curries wasn\\'t as evaporated, maybe the Rice was just cooked and steam did it in?\\n\\nLOL, my mother while eating...  \"Spicy, spicy, spicy, spicy....\"\\nGiven that the mood of the decor is suitable for a date and that the booths can make you fe\\nel like a VIP with some privacy, I really wanted the food and service to match.\\n\\nI told my friend to order the first thing on the menu, FREE WI-FI!  Yup, it was a bit weird to see that as the first note on the menu.  The best part of my meal was the PINEAPPLE SMOOTHIE?  \\n\\nThe Tom Yum Soup missed its mark on the spice scale as I couldn\\'t really pick up the heat until my last few spoonful.  The Papaya Salad (Tiger Shrimp) did a little better but the first time it was served, the Friendly waiter noticed it didn\\'t have Shrimps on the plate then when it came back it had \"3\"...  1, 2, 3 Medium Tiger Shrimps scattered around the plate.\\n\\nThe Panang (Chicken) was average as well, spiced correctly as I ordered it Medium Spicy and it came with lots of sauce, so the waiter suggested Steam Rice for it.  I\\'m looking at my bill now and seeing $2.00 for Rice?  I\\'m definitely not in a Chinese restaurant near my part of town anymore.\\n\\nMy friend had the Chicken & Shrimp Pad Thai.  It was made with Tamari\\nnd sauce for the noodles but the noodles kind of stick together on the bottom of Chicken, Egg, and 1, 2, 3! Shrimps.  I told my friend to MIX HARDER, put some effort into it!\\n\\nThe waiter was friendly and answered my questions about the Lunch Buffet since this is my first time seeing a Thai Lunch Buffet anywhere.  However the bill took a bit longer than normal to arrive, knowing he had customers coming in to the restaurants to deal with he had plenty of time to push a couple buttons.  He had time to write THANK YOU on the bill after all.\\nCute little place in Times Square Plaza that does BEAUTIFUL individual cakes.  Again it\\'s a small place that I\\'ve told my friend about, but unfortunately it\\'s not an ideal DATE place in his opinion.  \\n\\nFood comes first before Date is MY opinion.  He was right as this CLEAN White & Metallic decor is so small that wherever you sit from the 3-4 tables, everyone will hear your TOPICS.  I think the waitress overheard me say the MILK on my Latte was too Froth\\ny, actually it wasn\\'t.  MY BAD!\\n\\nYou\\'ll also notice the Culinary Diploma hung on the wall next to the Kitchen.  It\\'s almost hung there like a Menu Board but it\\'s hung there with PRIDE.\\n\\nThis place advertises High Tea which I wish to give a try someday.  The cakes were beautiful and when we CUT into it that was when the fillings make a perfect color contrast with each other as if you\\'re going on an exploration and DISCOVERING something new to man-kind.\\n\\nYou\\'ll notice it\\'s more of a place for the LADIES or Soccer-Moms and as you know Times Square is an Asian Plaza.  GUYS should try this out too and start the Dessert Appreciation Revolution(DAR)!\\n\\nI heard the Pastry Chef does some lessons as well which I\\'m interested too as Pastry is too technical for me at this moment.\\nBrief Intro:\\n\\nScarborough Town Centre is centrally located near the BUSY highway 401, in-between Brimley road and McCowan road.  It has an Upper Bowl and a Lower Bowl where majority of the Food Court is on top, just follow', 'actual_label': 33, 'predicted_label': 33}, {'text': \" your nose to the delicious Curry smell from Tandori(Fast Food).  By no surprise, there is Toronto Police Services along side the Security Office.  It also has the convenience of a Wal-Mart and a nearby Real Canadian Superstore for your grocery shopping needs.\\n\\nSeating Comfort Level:(**---)\\n\\nThe seats here are wooden bench seating with hard green metallic arms.  Advantage is that it has backs for leaning but far from a comfortable lounging environment.   I guess there was NEVER a seat budget when they renovate this place year after year.  However long you are able to sit down at a TTC bench without any ass-damage is however long you should be sitting on these eye sores.\\n\\nSafety Zone:(****-)\\n\\nSafety Zone at STC is wide ranging from the point of the SportChek & Famous Players entrance to the TTC entrance.  For a short visit, staying within this region is plenty enjoyable and MOST people do just visit this stretch as they go from TTC through to the Food Court towards the Parking Lot and v\\nice versa.\\n\\nI like to call this zone the 'Wallet Saver' zone because the Upper Bowl consists of Famous Players, Sport Chek, Old Navy, and Food Court while the Lower Bowl consists of the much appreciated Bulk Barn & Everything for a Dollar combination along with Tim Hortons and McDonalds.\\n\\nIf you do plan on passing this Safety Zone, PLEASE go down the escalators at the Upper Bowl Food Court point or else if you go for the escalators at the Centre Court it becomes hazardous.  Walking from the Food Court towards the Centre Court escalator on the Upper Bowl, the direct line-of-vision is at the deadly Birks/Swarozski side-by-side 1-2 punch.  Hopefully you can lure them towards Godiva instead.  \\n\\nBeyond this point on there's not much you can do but strategically choose your path as best as possible once you are on the lower level.  At Centre Court, walk left if your group isn't into Young & Hip(Sephora, Mac, Garage Clothing, La Senza, Spring, Aeropostale) and walk right if your group isn't S\\nophisticated Chic(Urban Behavior, Le Chateau, Jacob Connexion, Mexx, Danier, R.W., Peoples, Fine Gold), Good Luck!\\n\\nExit Strategy:(****-)\\n\\nThe best spot is at the end of the Upper Bowl Food Court where you'll see GAP and Second Cup, or follow your nose to a Popcorn smell(Kernels).  It gives an option of going towards the TTC Light Rail Transit, towards the internals of the mall, and towards the exit of the Famous Players end.  You can also decide to go down a level towards the Toronto Police if things turn UGLY.\\n\\nAnother reason is that this is the HIGH traffic area where everyone converges and you'll even see Police and Security around this zone from time to time.  If you need a quick escape just bland into the sea of people as if you're at New York Times Square.\\n\\nEntertainment Level:(*----)\\n\\nUnfortunately not much entertainment points to give out here either unless you like that whole people watching scene from the comforts of the limited seating at the food court.  I would suggest th\\nat a good place to sneak off is still within the Safety Zone.  Famous Players has an ARCADE area however be prepared for that years-old Popcorn stench that is forever hidden inside the theatre's carpets.  More suggestions are EB Games, Black's, The Source, HMV.\\nDON'T judge a book by it's cover!  I came here prior to June 30th and saw they had a sign saying they won't open until after June 30th, I believe it is for redecorating.  I was thinking WHY a Thai place would open up around this neighbourhood and why it is only for take-out and catering?\\n\\nIt opened and looked at the FOREIGN lettering, could that be Thai or Indian language because they are both very interesting.  I walked in and FOUND my answer, it is a smaller version of Babu and it is Sri-Lankan South Indian Cuisine.\\n\\nIf I ever open a restaurant, I'll name it DOG Food Resto but serve Designer Cat Food.  Serves me right for pre-judging restaurants by name.\\n\\nI was greeted by a friendly young man behind the counter but what caught\\n my attention was the DESSERT counter.  It was displayed so beautifully and so many to select from.\\n\\nThere are no menu boards anywhere so if you aren't familiar, you'll have to ask them for their take-out menu.  I saw Tandoori 1/2 Leg for $1.00 and saw it on the hot tray.  \\n\\nIt doesn't have as much items on the menu as Babu but still enough for local Indians to come in one after another but once again no line designation so use the Meat Counter ordering method and get the staff's attention anyway you can.  I did cause I was the only Chinese there for around 15 minutes I was there.\\n\\nGot the Mutton Curry medium size for $4.00 and 3 Samosas for $1.00 which was the Samosa fillings I like which had Onion/Peas/Corn bits in a Potato mix but I didn't notice as much spice aside from bits of Red Chili Pepper.  Mutton was cut up into small cubes so it was just a bit chewy but the Curry was alright.\\n3-Star considering that I've never had AUTHENTIC Mexican and basically have nothing Mexican to comp\", 'actual_label': 33, 'predicted_label': 33}, {'text': 'are to except Taco Bell, I\\'m sorry to say.\\n\\nI stepped in the DOOR seeing a couple ladies coming out holding a piece of CAKE in a take-out container.  YUP, I did hold the doors for the ladies.  My Pleasure!\\n\\nWe found ourselves here with a Mexican-theme decor that began from the uneven Mexican-ly orange tiles all the way to the top of the windows where a few CLAY statues and heads/masks.  Everything inbetween made this place as Mexican as a long-time Torontonian can imagine without ever been to Mexico.\\n\\nGreeted by an elderly man with a couple of menus, which i made out some items such as Quesadilla, Taco, Burritos where others were foreign to me which was great.  We ordered Taco AL PASTOR which came with either side of Rice or Beans.  \\n\\nInside of the Soft Double Wrapped Taco I noticed a mixture of Onions and Pork much like Pulled Pork.  Here\\'s where the Salsa Bar came in to play.  I tried the more MELLOW flavours of Pico de Gallo and Medium Green Tomatillo Salso.  \\n\\nPico de Gallo was a F\\nRESH contrast to the Pork mixture inside the Taco.  The Tomatillo Salsa was nicely spiced as well and that was as far as I went knowing I\\'m going back to work right after and didn\\'t want any unintended accidents.  The Bar also had Limes, Onions, Cilantros for your pleasure.\\n\\nPrices are reasonable but it wasn\\'t a meal that I felted FULLY stuffed, but I guess I have been over stuffing myself lately.  The Tacos were served laided on top of one another and because of the mixture inside, the side laying down got a bit too SOGGY which made it hard to hold as it almost fell apart.  Triple Wrapping required???\\n\\nTres Leches Cake($5.00) was actually a nice finish for the Mains.  The Sponge Cake looked soaked from Milk while the top had some Whip Cream and the plate was full of Evaporated Milk.  I HEART this cake, simple & delicious. Soaked but NOT soggy Tres Leches Cake, awesome stuff Mexico!\\n\\nWe also had a couple Soda Juices(Mango, Mandarin) (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jarritos) which were ma\\nde in Mexico that helped to complete this Mexican vacation of mine.  I could SMELL the Mango while drinking it.\\nComing out of a Coffee Shop and walked 2 steps, I stopped and noticed a SHORTBREAD shop and started reading the outside notes on the door.  Following behind me from the Coffee Shop a lady with hands full of Coffee asked me nicely if I can open the door to this place.  Sure!\\n\\nAs I opened the door for her, she invited me in and thanked me.  She offered me a Cookie(Chocolate Crunch, $1.75) and went inside the back while the friendly staff at the counter of this small cute Shortbread/Cookie shop offered me a free Cookie from a good selection.\\n\\nI didn\\'t even know Toronto has a Gourmet Shortbread Shop so that itself is a new feature to me.  It\\'s been awhile since I had Shortbread and I just have to say that it has never been my type of go-to Food.  From a non-expert point-of-view, it\\'s average however I did enjoy the crunch factor.\\n\\nChecking out their website, it does have that Gif\\nt element similar to Cupcake Shops but as you know there are plenty of Cupcake Shops in T.O and barely any Shortbread if any others exist.\\nI walked inside and saw Beer Taps and Bar Counter.  Not my idea of a Cafe but maybe it is a new Cafe concept I thought.  I slowly walked in while the Bartender did his work.  Nope, no espresso machines or cups.  I saw a way through behind the curtain at the back.  Sounds like a porn shop, right?  It lead to the Cafe side which is, The One in the Only.\\n\\nI remember Greg C. said that sometimes enjoying a drink is a personal preference and in this case I\\'m not sure what did it for me but I enjoyed my Cappuccino while seating at the comfy back sofa seats just in front of the doorway to their back Patio.  The Pumpkin Muffin($2.00) was A-OK too with all those Pumpkin Seeds on top.  I believe it\\'s imported since I saw similar Muffins from other Cafes.\\n\\nI can see why it\\'s one of Kat Fs fav since I saw two Apple Laptop users side by side.  I thought it was he\\nr sitting there.  :p  There\\'s even a spinning Disco Ball on the ceiling for those party animal minded.  Lots of books for that reading environment at the back while you will notice lots of art and photos on the wall which I\\'m sure at least one will peak your interest.\\nAfter work I took my Girl(Rusty Subaru) out for dinner but she was complaining to me on our way there @@ how she was running low on energy, so I rushed to the nearest Gas Station to fill-her-up on some cheap stuff(Basic unlead) while I looked for something to eat on my own. (Eventually every Yelper would start off a review in this format.  \"I took my SO/GF/BF....\"  so this is MY version)\\n\\nPho Dai Nam has more of a Mood-lighting atmosphere especially with the Wood Panels and dim Sconce although the seating is typical Pho \"whatever\" variety.  It is a Vietnamese & Thai restaurant but some of the items remind me more of Chinese than anything else(i.e. Roast Duck Leg, Black Bean item, Sweet & Sour item.)\\n\\n#41 Special Beef Nood', 'actual_label': 33, 'predicted_label': 33}, {'text': \"le Soup($6.50/large) came out nice and hot with Garnish(Lime/Sprouts/Basil) while the items such as Tendon and Tripe was quite limited and actually so was the cooked and uncooked Beef or at least the first two for sure.  Broth was more salty as I tasted it to begin the meal and the Pho Noodles were dry-packaged kind.\\n\\nStaff was nice while the 2-3 tables of Patrons consumed the meal.  The Sprouts didn't look Top-quality in comparison to other places and no whole Chili was provided.  If anything, Garnishes should be pretty fresh still as Fu Yao Supermarket(Chinese) was just a few steps away and even one of the Lady working there came back from there with a Grocery Bag.\\n~ M O F O N G O ~\\n\\nDO NOT, I repeat DO NOT confuse that word as long-form for MOFO.\\nMOFONGO actually is the abbreviation of the famed internet slang, OMG.\\n\\nI'll let the ingredients tell the story...\\n\\n- House Garlic Sauce \\n- Chicharron de Puerco\\n- Deep Fried Mashed Plantains  \\n- Broth Soup/Stew\\n- Choice of Meat\\n\\nThe Traditi\\nonal Dish served on a Pilón (Wooden Mortar & Pestle).\\nFans of North American Mashed Potatoes with Toppings will like this.\\nI didn't fan Shrimps as choice of Meat, Mini Cocktail Shrimps anyone?\\n\\nDish($13.00) is few times the price of restaurant Mashed Potatoes.\\nWhile this is not a Side-Dish per se but an Entrée therefore the cost.\\nGot a side order of Tostones($3.50) just because that's how I roll...\\n\\nChivo a la Monte Cristi($11.50?)\\n~ Stewed Goat is soft & tender IF you get the Boneless piece.\\n   The Goat Meat stuck to my teeth is not meant for snack later.\\n   Why does the Rice seem clumpy?

I felt under-dressed as usually Steakhouses d\\no this service for you.\\n\\nLemon Herb dressing was light and flavourful, put on the side as requested while servers top up Water at a selection of tables.  Hollandaise is nice consistency and flavour while Poached Eggs are runny yummy.  Huevos was a mess of the described ingredients that is fulfilling for that Sunday first Meal of the day.\\n\\nYou get to line-up inside which is better than other Brunch locations Downtown and the today's Tip is there is barely any wait if you settle for the BAR(!) area(Sportsnet on TV) like those Guys did, but obviously with the Ladies they always want that Mood light Wood Pub homey feel which provides more attentive service while they talk and you EAT.\\n\\nNote: Kids get to draw on the craft paper covering the Table using crayons.\\nDate Night might include a few rounds of Bowling then Dinner but not at this Old Kennedy Road destination.

I was having a Red Bean Ice Drink with Mango Ice Cream, Sour Plum Drink as my Friend had Grass Jelly Ice Drink with Ice Cream.\\n\\nThey have Handmade F\", 'actual_label': 33, 'predicted_label': 33}, {'text': \"quick. I guess rent is really expensive. \\n\\nTonight we came here for a private party, with a set menu for about 25 guests. We had a nice private room (one of many) downstairs in the cellar (this is where the movenpick fish market used to be!). \\n\\nIt's beautifully decorated, with wooden tables (big square ones in booths) and communal tables. In the private room, there was exposed brick and 2 long wooden tables. I like this arrangement because it's provoke conversation with more than 2 people. I believe there was also a flat screen television at the back behind a curtain. \\n\\nAs this party was not organized by me, I can't tell you if they were accomodating (seemed to be) or not etc. However, as a guest, you'll hear my story. \\n\\nToasted olive bread came out and was refilled part way. Vinegar came with it, however, the servers forgot to bring out olive oil (only came for one table , not 2) - that was disappointing as they realized it after the main course came. \\n\\nThe food was not bad, not amazi\\nng.  We had 3 choices for antipasto, entree and dessert. The grilled calamari ($13 on the menu) was not bad, however, not every part of the calamari was grilled and there were some spongy parts, it made me think it was undercooked. The portions were good. The Arugula salad was just a regular leafy salad ($10) and also a full meal portion, as was the Caeser salad. The Tiger Shrimp was about 3-4 big shrimps with bread on the side. \\n\\nFor entrees I had the Chicken Piccata. I had asked how this was served and if this would be chicken breast. She was unable to answer me, and asked someone. Coming back she told me it was a deboned chicken - which didn't really answer my question. I should have taken a hint and not risked it, but I ordered it anyway. I HATE CHICKEN BREAST for this reason: usually it's dry and flavourless. And that's exactly what I got. It came on a bed of gorganzola polenta (i dislike polenta as well) which tasted okay, but not my cup of tea. Rapini, but only a few stalks. \\n\\nT\\nhe steak ($34) seemed like a good portioned size. However, we were told that we were not able to choose the doneness of the meat (minus 1) and that it would all come medium. It all came, medium rare and almost rare. The insides were completely pink/rare. If this was my party, I would have raised a stink about this. Fail.\\n\\nThe dessert, however (the Dark Chocolate Baci bombe) was AMAZING. It was a chocolate mousse sitting on top of a hazelnut praline. It made me think that they did not make this in house.  The in house Tiramusu was served in 2 ice cream scoops, and lacked the potent liqueur flavour. \\n\\nI would have given the food 3 stars, given I expected less in terms of portions sizes and price, however, it's quite reasonable for Yorkville. I'd probably order pasta ($12-16) if I were here again. \\n\\nHOWEVER, the problem with sitting at a restaurant for over 5 hours (we left at 12) is that we had a lot of time to criticize and contemplate.  The Service left a lot to be improved.  It seemed\\n like all the waiters were young tall muscular guys that had no clue what they were doing. Everytime it was time to serve, there would be at least 4-5 people in the room with the same dish, trying to figure out who had what. They need a cheat sheet - and really, the people with the steak knives are having steak. was it that hard to figure out??\\n\\nWhen we finished each course, my dirty cutlery was taken from my plate and put to the side (not even nicely with the knife on top of the fork). For a restaurant of this calibre, and this private room,  I would expect my cutlery to be replaced, especially since they had to bring out steak knives. \\n\\nWater was no where to be seen and we had to ask multiple times. \\n\\nI really think their wait staff needs to step it up to stay in business. \\n\\nThe place is loud. And with a private room, it would be nice to install a door. Some other rooms had a door. When toasts were made, I couldn't hear the person beside me. \\n\\nAs a casual eater in the area, come for \\nthe dessert and the wine (excellent).\\nHow do you review just the company itself without bashing this flagship store? I've divided this update between the PHYSICAL STORE and ONLINE EXPERIENCE. I have mixed feelings about it all. \\n\\nIf you want to shop at the Bay, this one is one of the better ones to go to. It's still highly disorganized on the shelves, and staff in some areas are rude and unknowledgable, but some other areas they are really nice. \\n\\nExample, we were in the bedding section, and everything is in order by Brand (as is everything else in the store) as opposed to type so we were trying to find Single and Queen size sheet sets (not duvet covers) but was having a hard time. My mom went to ask an associate as I wandered around, and I overheard her saying that they didn't have any. Sorry, this is called lazy, because I just found a whole bunch. There was another associate , also in bedding, who was actually helpful or at least pretended to be which was nice. \\n\\nThis flagship store\", 'actual_label': 34, 'predicted_label': 34}, {'text': \" also has The Room for fancy high end designer stuff (of which, if you buy, you get HBC points!) as well as on the same floor more midrange brands like BCBG, Topshop, Guess. \\nThe shoe section on the 2nd floor is also a mess, especially during sale days, so be prepared to look. \\nIf you're tired of looking, go to the 4th floor and take part in free personal shopping! If you read my previous review, you can see how its great for some people like my mom, but possibly not so much for me (younger, more choice in clothing in retail stores). You are only limited by what the Bay carries. However, the experience is really fun.\\n\\nThere is free parking at Bay and Adelaide centre underground parking on the weekends with minimum purchase of $20. I think weekday as well, but I don't remember the price.\\n\\nONLINE EXPERIENCE (2 stars)\\nEveryday I am bombarded by twitter, hourly emails, flyers, radio ads at least 3 times a day during their Baydays sale period telling me about their 25% off sale storewide. A\\nlthough great, most retailers send an email with an end date when it starts, and again when it finishes - not EVERYDAY! In addition, there's ZERO engagement with the Twitter crowd, which I find pointless. No wonder, some people just opt out of things like this.\\n\\nI ordered some stuff during the sale, and it arrived on my front door in 2 days. Yay for Canada Post and yay for the Bay warehouse in Scarborough somewhere doing this so quickly. \\n\\nYet, my experience buying a $600 Dyson was not so much. [long story begin] My mom wanted to get me this as a gift, put her billing address and my shipping address. We bought it during a promotion for 1 million points upon purchase (about $150)  They declined her card for whatever reason, and since she had to repurchase on another card, this promotion could not happen - but it's ok, 25% was also good too. This card for whatever reason ALSO had some error, but they did not notify us this time. So we sit and wait, until I called in to find out. The rep \\non the phone did not want to reveal the error reason to my mom ! And told her she can only repurchase the item 3 days from now (only when the sale is over, how convenient). Asking to speak to a supervisor  - they hung up on her. [long story over] Anyway, decided to buy the thing directly from Dyson.\\n\\nAnd they never called us back!\\n\\nThanks for reading.\\nWe ordered delivery from here, but I think next time we'd order from Sushi on Bloor. The menu prices were about the same, and we didn't really order any izakaya appetizers. \\n\\nThere's a good combo there for $13.95 that comes with a full tempura dish, gyoza, teriyaki beef/chicken/salmon, miso soup, rice, salad, and sushi/california rolls. It was HUGE and I'm impressed JP J. finished it. \\n\\nI got a $10.95 12 piece sashimi set, that comes with rice, miso and salad. Fish was decent tasting. Nothing stood out. \\n\\nI would have given this 4 stars, but I found that it took them over an hour to get the food. Perhaps another reason to get from Sushi o\\nn Bloor, depending on your location.\\nExcellent food. Great atmosphere. Came here for a birthday dinner on a Saturday night. It was extremely busy, so I recommend reservations. \\n\\nThis wouldn't be a place to take your first date. It's a group dining experience and it's loud. Loud enough that shouting becomes your main way of talking, and then you forget how to talk softly. I'm not even sure how the servers hear us. \\n\\nFood was really good. And well priced. Lots of small appetizers to choose from, and really, you could make a meal out of it by just choosing the small dishes and sharing with one or two other people. \\n\\nFor the two of us, we ordered 2 antipasti and one main course to share, and it was enough with still room for some dessert. \\nThe Giant Meatball was excellent. I don't know what was in the sauce, or what's in the meatball but I wanted another one. \\nThe grilled calarmari was also good (not spectacular) but flavourful and soft, yet still crunchy.  ($8.95-$11)\\n\\nOur main was the sl\\now cooked beef ribs with pan fried gnocchi. I did expect a bed of gnocchi but there were only 4. And they were undercooked and difficult to eat. BUT, the beef ribs was amazeballs. Falling off the bone, even had some tendon to suck on. The sauce was my favourite. \\n\\nThe service was interesting. Our server was not extra attentive, just enough. We were also sitting right in the middle of the restaurant and it's hard to miss us.\\n\\nAt some point in the meal, we for plates that we were told was pulled pork and something else. Then about 5 minutes later the busboy came and took it away: it was neither pulled pork or for our table. \\n\\nHowever, our server did play along when I was asking for a pretend dessert but really planning a birthday surprise. I guess that's twhere they loudness came into my advantage. \\n\\nOur bill couldn't be separate, even by groups. How disappointing. \\n\\nThe wines we got (reds, 2 different ones) were watery tasting. A coffee connoisseur at the table gave the espresso a 3 out\", 'actual_label': 34, 'predicted_label': 34}, {'text': ' of 5 as the flavour wasn\\'t rich enough. \\n\\nYah, I\\'d come back . Just the loudness factor really takes away from a good meal.\\nAlthough walking up the stairs it smelt like toilet.... it was pleasantly surprised with a great time playing pool with friends on a Thursday evening.\\n\\nThere\\'s snooker tables and 8 ball tables. It seems intimidating when you first walk in, but it\\'s friendly, and seems like a good alternative than trying to compete with people at a bar for a pool table. \\n\\nIf you squint your eyes, you might be able to see the smoke clouds that used to line the ceiling. But it\\'s nice that all that is gone. \\n\\nThey have a full bar, with beers.\\nI was prepared for a terrible experience coming in here, but it was okay. \\n\\nI came in for my 1pm appointment with my mom, and saw two girls just finishing. Although we had to wait for the girl previous to leave, it was okay as we got a chance to browse the dresses, and they had someone there who wasn\\'t your consultant to chit chat with you. \\n\\nI \\nkind of wished that the women who spoke to me first was to help me, as she seemed to understand what I was looking for. Instead, when it was finally my turn, it was someone else, and I had to explain myself all over again. \\n\\nAre they pretentious in here? A little, but keep in mind that the dresses are any where from $3000+, but I felt they were mostly $5000 to $10k.  Be prepared for this, and that is why you are here. I have to say that there is something to be said about the quality and workmanship here and compared with some of the other Yorkville boutiques with similar dresses at this price, it just doesn\\'t compare. \\n\\nThe dresses here are beautiful, and be careful if you\\'re not willing to pay. I tried on a beautiful $6500 mermaid dress. But I don\\'t like the style. They told me that they can alter it, and pull up the entire waist line to wherever I wanted. Alternations at flat fee $850 for whatever you would want done. \\nAfter the seamstress pinned my new cut, I loved it. And I cried.\\n But, alas, I may have to let this one go. \\n\\n(aside: I find it interesting that there are many stores that have dresses $2,500 and under and many that go above that, but i haven\\'t come across anything in between!)\\n\\nAs I was leaving, the lady had disappeared and on to the next girl, with another family waiting for their turn. Seems like they have lots of business, but not enough people to service.\\nI like this one. It\\'s big, has lots of selection, things are somewhat organized. There\\'s a Starbucks downstairs for a pre-shopping coffee. \\n\\nThe place is big, but not too big. Walking around didn\\'t seem a big hike, but lots of see. It would be my first pick to go to a Canadian Tire.\\nCame here for my cousin\\'s wedding dinner. Seems like a very popular place among the folks living here.  There was us, plus another wedding part, and regular non-chinese.  The rest of the restaurant was ten over by a large anniversary celebration. This definately seems like the place to be some how. \\n\\nThe food here \\nwas pretty good. My cousin also did a good job of hand picking the dishes.  \\nMy favourite was the soft shell crab. \\n\\nThey also have an interesting way of presentation, like the chicken that was cut with the head and tail added (custom) but looked like a flat chicken. Or the weird egg garnished we all picked at. \\n\\nThe service was unfriendly and sometimes rude. They were strange about taking away the food, and clearing the plates. I don\\'t\\' know who would win in terms of mean service staff Emerald or here\\nFriday evening. 6pm. Dinner. \\nWith advice from Kat F. I made reservations and so glad that I did. I was a bit late, but they still held the table for us. There was a lineup with about 3 parties, and we walked right by like VIPs and got seated at our table. AWESOME. \\nI guess this is the type of place that don\\'t really need to allow reservations, but I\\'m very glad they did. \\n\\nHowever, the table was right in front of the kitchen kind of in the middle nowhere. I commented to my friend that t\\nhis was awesome, but we got the crappiest seat in the house. My friend said, are you gunna yelp about it? I said probably. Then... maybe he heard me, maybe he didn\\'t, but the manager (? guy with glasses) passed by and said \"you can see the kitchen? sorry about that. would you like free drinks?\"\\nI\\'m like... uhh. SURE!!! and i got a half pint of beer :) :)\\n\\nOnion rings are superb. \\n\\nI took a long time to decide. My ultimate burger would be Bison + Egg + Pineapple + Mushroom + Cheese + avacado + Bacon ... but that\\'s just heart attack waiting to happen. \\nHad to be selective. \\nGot a Bison ($9.95) + Chipotle Ketchup (free) + Monteray Jack Cheese ($1.25) + Portobello Mushroom ($2.50)\\n\\nTo be honest, it was good, but could have been better. The cheese was thin (i.e. melted, I can see thru it) and the ketchup was only in the middle of the sandwich so only tasted it with one bite.  The mushrooms were there, but didn\\'t really add much to the burger. \\nHowever, I will come back there one day and try', 'actual_label': 34, 'predicted_label': 34}, {'text': ' this infamous frilled cheese with egg. \\n\\nWe were a little hurried, to get our bill and sod off, but I could see why: there was at least another 5 parties waiting (and line up out the door). As we walked past them, I wanted to shout, You can CALL AHEAD!!\\nWhen you look at the menu the food descriptions doesn\\'t seem like anything special. Even when it shows up on your plate it still looks quite plain, however when it goes in your mouth, it\\'s oh so good!\\n\\nI ordered the rigatoni alla vodka - pancetta, red onion and vodka rose sauce(funnily enough this is exactly what it is and how it\\'s described on the menu)\\nThe pasta was al dente and cooked perfectly. The sauce flavourful and yummy. \\n\\nThe portions seemed small, but it was the perfect size to feel full but not full enough to not get dessert. \\n\\nPastas range from $13-16 which is fairly decently priced in the yorkville area.\\n\\nThe staff were friendly, but the minute we didn\\'t want dessert, they gave us the bill.  After we continued chatting, b\\nut then they removed our glasses (full with water). Time to leave I guess, but kinda of rude.\\nI was only here for a short while at the tail end of my friend\\'s surprise birthday.  They had booked a pool table and a small corner for a drop in birthday party. \\n\\nWhen I was there, we had a dedicated server, who was super friendly and seemed to be really on top of things. I know they were busy with a large party of rowdy Second City alums, but seemed like she still was able to make it us every so often, even though our drinks sometime disappeared. \\n\\nThey have couches, and small tables. You can play board games, pool and we had brought our own cake and snacks and they seemed really cool with it. \\n\\nIt\\'s steps from King and Adelaide, so take a walk of the strip here instead!\\nSurprisingly this it he first time I\\'ve ever been to a walk-in and this experience makes me question I want  my family doctor. \\n\\nI was referred to here by my family doctor who wasn\\'t available on a weekend. With a short for\\nm to fill, and no line up, I was screened with my issue. Soon after the doctor came in, and immediately knew what to give me. \\nSeems to make sense, and straightforward, not sure why my family doctor has dismissed it as something else. \\n\\nIt\\'s right beside the Shoppers which is convenient for \\'scripts.\\nMaybe its premature of me, only been in here fore 5 minutes, but I think I found one of my favourite coffee/cafe/workspaces. \\n\\nRight across from Riverdale park, I\\'ve passed by a lot and it\\'s apparent its a neighbourhood haunt. \\n\\nThe homey and rustic feel, plus the friendly staff make you feel at home, and among strangers, but strangely familiar. \\n\\nOk, I\\'m swooning, but it helps that they have a Green Tea Latte. I find this so rarely in North America, They don\\'t serve it at Starbucks (like in Hong Kong), but they do have it at Second Cup. Rarely you see it in the indie coffee houses. I\\'m impressed with the list of hot beverage conctions that they have including\\n - Toasty Almond Latte\\n - Wal\\nnut Green Tea Latte\\n - Matcha Green Tea Latte - it\\'s a bit more milky tasting than I would like, but still yummy\\n - Chocolate Mint Latte (omg.) i need to try this\\n and of course with the option of Soy Milk. \\n\\nTons of the usual coffee options like lattes, cortados, etc etc. \\nAlso. \\nHot Apple Cider\\nHot (or Cold) Lemonade (which I also need to try)\\nHot Cranberry Apple\\n\\nThey also have tons of munchies like cookies, macaroons (the coconut kind) and savouries like empandas. I can see myself spending an entire day here. \\n\\nLarge communal table at the back, and it\\'s full of boardgames. I think I might be back here one evening. And I\\'m currently sitting in a leather arm chair at perfect height, comfy but not too comfy I will sleep. I have surfaces to put my things and I\\'m being quite productive (except for this review). \\n\\nFree Wifi, free parking (between 10am-2 and 3 onwards) on Riverdale one street south.\\nThis is one of the few places I\\'ve seen that still has carts! I miss that. Given, I guess \\nyou have to strategize to know what\\'s fresh or not. \\n\\nThe food was okay. Not spectacular. but very good. A great place to come for a work celebration or work lunch.  The clientel is mostly local Chinese folk, or people that work near by. \\n\\nThey are SO aggressive here! On many of an occasion they would put plates on our table, and say \"here, you like this!\" We\\'re like...no, thanks, full \"No! you like this!\" And when I say no a second time, they take it back (one of them was ever grumbling how we didn\\'t want vegetables!)\\nIt\\'s like they make a commission here or something. \\nI would suggest, know what you want, and don\\'t succumb to their ploys. \\n\\nThey are super busy around here, so don\\'t be afraid of putting up your hand and flagging someone down. \\n\\ni\\'m not sure of the price for each dish, but for 10 people, we paid about $18 PER PERSON....\\n@mendphysio #30daysofYelp\\nI was looking for an RMT on short notice, and thought of Mend Physio since I pass by it almost everyday!\\n\\nI\\'m always apprehen', 'actual_label': 34, 'predicted_label': 34}, {'text': \"sive about trying new RMTs, but I thought if this one was good, it's near my work and much more convenient than my old location. \\n\\nNicole was absolutely amazing. On our first session, she was able to attribute my low back pain to hip flexors and poked around in there during the treatment. Made the pain 10x better!!!\\nI went back the next week, and the so called sprain on my toe, actually was a huge know on my foot which she released and felt like a whole weight lifted on my toe. WHO KNEW you can have pain like this. \\n\\nIts clear that she knows about the body and its mechanics. She tries to fix you, while giving you a relaxing massage. The pressure is awesome. Tough enough for a deep tissue loving person like me, but relaxing enough to de-stress. My only problem now is that I'm addicted. \\n\\nThey also have Physio services, from which I hear, is more than just your typical physio that sees you and leaves you on a laser for 30 mins. They will recommend a course of treatment for you, (only if \\nyou need it) and do something called Manual Therapy. I haven't yet tried to get an assessment with Candice yet, but I plan to once I get my benefits sorted out. \\n\\nIf you're in the area, I recommend coming here!!\\n\\nStreet parking on Carlaw until 5pm or they ticket you. Really strict about ticketing on this street. free parking one street south if you're lucky.\\nI love this hidden gift store on the Yonge Strip. We came by it after brunch and I love this small store full of goodies! You have things on the floor to ceiling book shelves full of unique gifts and jewelery. So many things to see! So many things you haven't seen before!\\nI feels like an art gallery that you can touch. \\n\\nThe stuff in here is along the lines of Drysdale+Co, Blue Banana and other gift stores. Not as quirky and blunt as Rolo, a lot more softened with a quiet sophistication. \\n\\nIts my new go-to gift store!\\nI have to say that The Bay has revamped it merchandise and look to give it a step up from what it used to be. \\n\\nI'm\\n not sure what the stigma with department stores is, at least with me. I would have much rather gone to any of the stores in the mall rather than buying from the Bay. Aside from the fact that you can never find anyone to help you, and it's usually dead inside, the brands offered were usually older and not appealing.\\n \\nAlthough I only perused the Men's section with AT, seeing the brands offered and price, it's actually a place I would come to shop. They've infused some higher brand names in here, as well as some more well known ones (Polo, Guess, Mexx, TopMan...) As you walk further to the back, you'll find yourself in a price point that you may as well have gone to Holt's for. There's also a cafe in the back there.\\n\\nI have to say, the decor has improved itself too. It's modern, clean and refreshing. \\n\\nBut, the people are still no where to be found, and you're lucky to find someone to help you pay. \\n\\nThe shoe section is a whole other story. I was pleased to see some good brands, and it'\\ns a great one stop place to have a look around and they have things from Nine West, to Coach (not to mention you can get great deals and points for your purchase). I was disappointed at the state of the actual seating area though. Shoes on the floor, dirty carpet with garbage, people lying around with their children like it was their living room. \\nThere is much potential in here to have it a nice clean place, but it just is not well maintained. \\nI also noticed that the stock room is not optimally laid out and the guy had to go from one end of the store to another to get two different pairs of shoes.\\n\\nGranted that this is the flagship store, it probably would be in better condition than the others. I haven't seen many other Bay Stores renovated with a nice layout. Most of them are still very much stuck in the 80s.\\nGreat Idea, Poor execution.\\n\\nYou can get a great iced or hot tea from their many selection of teas for $2.75 (or for $5+ something infused with matcha or other extracts). \\nThe\\ny have a crazy awesome selection of teas, but it's way too many to choose from at a short time. \\nThe small plastic sign near the cashier helps, and segregates the tea by black, green, white, etc but I wish there was more description about them, like what they include, or how they taste. Just a name like Summerfresh, doesn't really tell me much. \\nSo what ends up happening is people that leave feeling it's too complicated, or spends a long time at the cashier asking questions, or just choosing a more expensive tea that has more description around it. Maybe that's the tactic.\\n\\nWhen I choose my tea, the chosen leaves are placed in a brewer and a timer (probably around 1-2 mins) was set. I wish I knew this, because I felt like I was waiting forever. Not to say that's it's not a good idea, but it just takes a while. \\n\\nWhile I was waiting, they got an on slaught of orders. I stood to the side, and they pushed my drink in front of me. Another customer came up and asked for sugar in her pomagra\", 'actual_label': 34, 'predicted_label': 34}, {'text': \"nte green tea (which is what I got) and they threw sugar in mine. I spoke up, and I tasted it and it was fine, but I was very annoyed they couldn't keep their orders straight, or at least ask. \\n\\nThe tea itself was good, but very light and diluted. I guess that's what happens if you only brew it for a short period of time. \\n\\nLike I said, good idea, needs better execution.\\nYou know, I thought Burrito Boyz was good....\\nI was already impressed when I brought it back to my office and picked it up, and it was HEAVY. I mean, like at least 2 lbs.\\n\\nI was also impressed by how the thing did not fall apart while I was eating it. \\n\\nOkay, really - CHOW MIEN instead of rice in your burrito?!?! It wasn't crunchy, but definitely a chance of pace. Also TONS of toppings that you don't need to pay extra for, including guac, cheese, sour cream, red onion, green peppers, edemame beans, black beans, cilantro and chipotle sauce.\\n\\n$6.99 you can get steak, pork, fish (wow looks yummy), chicken with all I menti\\noned above, rice or noodles.\\n\\n$7.99 there is a VEGAN option that looks also equally amazing. \\n\\nHonestly, after stuffing your face, it all tastes the same, except for the texture. \\n\\nI just finished it in my office, and now time for a nap!\\n(note: not to be confused with Luxe Event Planning also in the same plaza) \\n\\nI've been to a few tanning studios each with different machines to get a spray on tan for my dance competitions. This one has been the best so far. \\n\\nThe location is good. Free parking in the evenings and along the side of the street. A little hard to find, as Luxe Tanning should not be confused with Luxe Destination Wedding planning, the first thing you see when you step into the small plaza. Keep walking around the pub, and you'll find it. \\n\\nThe girls here are really friendly, courteous and thoughtful. Booking my appointment, they helped me consider the timing, and explained to me everything I needed to know before and after  the tan.  I was also running late,and they were a\\nble to accommodate me.\\n\\nWhat they have here is VERSA SPA. If you're going to a spray tan anywhere, not just here, try to find this machine. It's better than Mystic Tan, and this other one I tried at belliar. \\n\\nIt left no streaking, very minimal smell, and a very natural colour. In the end I looked like the colour I became after my week long trip in Mexico.  It was super \\neasy to use with a electronic guy that talks and guides you through.\\n\\nTheir suggestions to prep for this is to be able to shower prior. It will help get rid of excess oils and help the pH of your skin so the colour can take better. You also have an option to get a $5 prep spray. \\n\\nAfterwards you can also get a $5 moisturizing finishing spray. From the girl's suggestion, she said it was better to get the finishing spray than the first one, if you had to choose.  Since I came in here with a Fabfind, I got both, I can't tell if it made a difference or not. \\n\\nBefore going into the booth, you have to put some barrier cream \\non your cuticles or anywhere that's dry. I was confused because for Mystic Tan they tell you to put globs of it on your finger nails, and a light layer on the tops of your hands and feet. Here, she said, anywhere that's dry, thin layer. It makes sense, because then the colour goes into the creases, potentially and looks funny. Put some on your cuticle and fingers (if have lots of lines) and thin around your feets.\\n\\nYou step into the machine, and you have to do 4 poses, (instead of jut back and front). Back, Front, and Two sides. The deep electronic voice guy will guide you and there are pictures on the side. My only complaint about this is that it's COLD. I was shivering in there, even with the heater!\\n\\nThe whole thing took about less than 10 mins, but a bit longer before where she was explaining to me the whole procedure.\\n\\nThe other thing that was pretty awesome was that about 2mins after I was done, the machine started to self clean. This means, no stink from the person before you, a\\nnd no brown soles of your feet from the previous person. Win win for the tanning studio and for me!  \\n\\nThere are 3 colour choices, and I picked 2 (1 being the lightest, and 3 being the darkest). It was really natural looking for me and was perfect. but I may try the darker one next time.\\n\\nYou cannot shower for 12 hours and the colour will develop over time. I did notice that after my shower, a good amount of the colour washed off, but continued to develop over time (like magic).\\n\\nIt's been about 2 days, and the colour is till there, but my face (which I do wash a lot) is noticeably lighter. The colour comes off the more I scrub. I can't see this lasting more than a week. \\n\\nI fully recommend this for any spray tan, especially if you're scared about streaking and a non-orange look!\\nThe class itself was ok, but I wasn't impressed with the facilities and some other aspects of my experience. They have a really good variety of classes, and is one of the only studios in the heart of downtown/\", 'actual_label': 34, 'predicted_label': 0}, {'text': 'financial district. No wonder they are so full. \\n\\nTHE FACILITIES\\nThe front entrance was busy. Shoes everywhere (could have a shelf) for shoes, so that shoes didn\\'t have to take up almost the whole surface area of the front desk area. \\nAs new students, everyone got a mini tour of where things were. \\n\\nThe bathrooms and change rooms are small. There are 2 rooms, one with 2 toilets and 2 showers, and 2 small benches for changing.  The other room has 2 benches, but is still small. You can leave your mat in the storage shelves, but it makes for a very messy looking storage room. There are 5 small lockers in this room. \\n\\nYou can hang your mats in the racks on the hallway, but there was no spray for me to use. The area is quite small and with 40 people coming out of a class it makes for a traffic jam. \\n\\nThe waiting area has some nice couches, and tea. There is also a water machine to refill your bottles (except it ran out of water)\\n\\nTHE CLASS (hot hatha)\\nThe class finishes about 5 mins before \\nthe next one starts. I wasn\\'t sure who was still in there in Savasana and who was leaving. \\nOne thing that really turned me off was the fact people were allowed to bring their purses into the room. BIG purses. \\nNot only was the place crowded, and mats were not placed to optimize space, but with big bags around me, it takes up a ton of space. \\n\\nThe class was simliar to moksha yoga, but with longer holds, and none of the strengthening aspects and more focus on the stretching. (no vinyasa and short chair pose and warriors)\\n\\nI also did not understand why in the middle of the class we were asked to turn our mats for the warrior and balancing series.  It disrupted the class, and for what? No one can see the mirror anyway, it\\'s so crowded. Why not just stay in place. Also when I did the balancing series it made no sense and I was dripping sweat on my friend\\'s mat behind me. \\n\\nI also wish the instructor would find out who were beginners in the class, and cater to them. helping them to feel com\\nfortable, and explaining the postures to better understand our bodies.  This is the first studio I\\'ve seen that didn\\'t help out the beginners or identify themselves to the teacher. It really helps when someone can explain the benefits of the savasana for example. \\n\\nI also was shocked when I put my ear to the floor to hear every single stomp from people walking around outside, and upstairs. Quite distracting. \\n\\nAlso, this is the first place I\\'ve been when 1/4 the people left before the final Savasana.\\n\\nOther than these technicalities, the instructor was great.\\n\\nThe place gets extra .5 for having such a variety of classes. Although I may not come back to this location, I\\'d still like to give the other location a try.\\nif you\\'re looking for a beautiful space, and food with beautiful presentation, and to spend a lot of money, this is the place. \\n\\nThe food was good, but I felt not for the price I paid.  I loved the food shots that I got, but it wasn\\'t worth the hefty price tag. \\n\\nI love the \\nmiso fish. Everything else was good, but nothing stood out in my mind. \\nCheck out my pics!\\nIt\\'s unfortunate, because their food is pretty good and has a good price point.  My last review commented on how the service was okay, but I\\'m taking this back based on a disappointing experience today. \\n\\nOn their menu they say Noodles (Udon+Soba). There is actually no explicit dish that as Soba noodles in it. There is one with Ramen noodles (called Ramen). \\nSo I asked if I can get the Mushroom Noodles, with Soba noodles. \\nThe server didn\\'t seem to understand me and said, \"yes, there is soup\". I said that I wanted to have different kind of noodles, Soba instead of Udon. \\nShe points to the Ramen noodles, and I said No, I want Soba noodles. She then nodded and went away. I also wanted an Egg in my noodles. \\n\\nWhen she finally came with my noodles, it was Ramen noodles. I wasn\\'t pleased. I have a wheat sensitivity, and didn\\'t want to have Ramen noodles and wanted the buckwheat ones.  I called her ove\\nr and said, this is not Soba noodles.  She didn\\'t seem to know what Soba noodles were, and I said, I want the brown colour noodles. \\nShe said they did have that, and I had to explain to her the brown colour noodles were Soba noodles. \\nShe said she would bring me a new one, but instead called the manager over. \\nI was pleased that when I explained it to him, he knew and it was clear to him what happened. But no apology was given. \\n\\nI got a new noodles, after an extra 10 mins wait. \\nbut they still charged me for the extra egg and offered no apology. \\n\\nSo many things wrong....\\n\\na) employees need to be trained on the different noodles\\nb) the menu needs to be changed to show that the choice is available\\nc) it was completely unprofessional to have a server who has no idea what the difference between soba, udon, and ramen was, nor that she didn\\'t understand english. she didn\\'t have to give me a dirty look when asking for subsitutions\\n - even if she didn\\'t know, she could have pretended, and th', 'actual_label': 34, 'predicted_label': 34}, {'text': 'en wrote it down and told the chef.

The anticipation walking down the looooong red hallway with the forest in the background, and going down So Many escalators to reach the first floor of funness! \\n\\n(It was always the Space Floor, and the one I dread because this is where my dad forced me to read what the activity was about before I can shoot metal balls into a hole that simulated a satellite) I only figured this out when I went again as a teenager. I never understood it and only pretended I did. \\n\\nThis review is about what was past, and it comes from someone who went there a lot as a kid. It\\'s hard not to compare.\\n\\nLucky for me thi\\ns exhibit is still around, however, a lot aren\\'t. Yes, we loved this place as a kid, but going back 15 years later, it\\'s really lost it\\'s edge. Is it because we are taller and jaded?? I think it\\'s also because they have completely re-done the place - taking out a lot of the interesting games/learning/exhibits and replaced them with computers, free for all \"creative space\" (Innovation Centre) that is a mess, and a Kiddie Area that I\\'m not allowed into because I\\'m too old. \\n\\nFrom what I remember, the entrance hall into the main \\'fun\\' physics area was the best part. There were so many random things happening, that it was a crazy fun science theme park. Now it seems sparse and lacks the encouragement for kids to discover. \\nThe physics/logic/music area hasn\\'t really changed since I was a kid. This means these exhibits are over 30 years old! Except they get moved around. Again it seems sparse and doesn\\'t engage the kids as much as it used to. I remember running from place to place wanting to\\n touch everything. They seem so far away from each other now.\\n\\nThe Communication (MindWorks) area is the best one. Not really fit for kids under the age of 12, but if you actually read each one of the exhibits and activities, it gives a lot of insight into the human mind, how it works, and the weird tricks we play. The other part of it is the Truth section of this, that helps you discover how your bias and believes can effect the way you think. \\n\\nI was really disappointed with the So called \"Innovation Centre\". The place was a mess, and are kids supposed to learn something here? It was just paper all over the place, and I\\'m not sure what they are supposed to do. What happened to organized learning, rather then letting your child roam free - it\\'s a science centre after all. \\n\\nFor the 20 or so years, we\\'ve seen sections come and go, and then your favourites disappear. Remember the Food Section? There was a huge plastic table with numbers, and a punch card you can write which foods you wo\\nuld eat for breakfast lunch and dinner. You put it into a machine, and it\\'ll tell you if you have a balanced diet or not. \\nI remember the place was a mess with the little pencils and paper everywhere, and it smelt funny due to the machine you press buttons and it spits out a small paper with smells on it. \\nMy dad and I loved the Japanese diorama here, that goes through the day of an olden japanese fishing village using sounds and lights. It was delicate, and serene. All of this has gone now. \\n\\nI also liked the Sports section, full of old sports history and how things work. There was even a small rock climbing wall and that platform that you jumped off and they tell you if you land too hard or not. There was also that wheelchair racing section too! This has gone to the deadpool as well. \\n\\nAs you get older, the appeal to keep going to the science centre starts to wane. That first time you visit when you\\'re older it\\'s the best thing and it\\'s nostalgic. Then you go another time, and things\\n just don\\'t seem as fun. Even writing this, I want to go again, however, I know that when I read the exhibits, I already know what it\\'s about, and then will pass it along. I think the next time I will go will be with a child. It\\'ll be a whole new experience then. \\n\\nThe OSC has a lot more to offer than meets the eye. The school groups get taken to the back areas with areas only open for them. They used to have a whole simulated space station, from the computer on land, to what you would do in the rocket. I went once with a Space Camp. \\n\\nIf you\\'re a parent reading this, YES take your kid here. Supposedly, in addition to all these exhibits, there special workshops and shows (like how to make paper) but everytime I go there, it doesn\\'t seem like they happen - I would check. \\n\\nIf you\\'re an adult looking for some fun, and you\\'ve never been here before, it\\'s worth a visit at least once. I would go for a movie or special exhibit that gives you combined admission to the place. \\n\\nIf you\\'re an ad', 'actual_label': 34, 'predicted_label': 34}, {'text': 'ult looking for nostalgia, it\\'s fun, but be warned: you might be disappointed.

High ceilings. The crowd isnt all students, but great for work (outlets are ample) and good for just a chat. \\n\\nMy only complaint is that the tables I am sitting at right now are too high vs that chair. My shoulders hurt. \\n\\nThe floor is also quite dirty and I really don\\'t want to put anything there. Needs a sweep. Crumbs everywhere. \\n\\nI do like how the treats, they have many all natural and gluten free options. I\\'ve actually always been a fan of Second Cup treats as opposed to you know, the other one. Also La Rocca cake slices are available if you want to indulge even more. \\n\\nFree wifi, but they want you to sign up with Facebook (and give access to your information), a sign up form, or a credit card (but it\\'s free!)\\n\\n\\nGreat place to kill some time and be productive between activities.\\nHalloween night. Busiest night of year. \\n\\nThis club that used to be Republik still dons it\\'s old sign at the back of the room. \\n\\nWe got bottles service, and I would highly recommend it doing it via the website thru the club itself, than through a promoter, unless you already have that connection.  I emailed the club via the website, and was communicating with viprich@clubxs.ca\\n\\nBottles usually cost $299 + 18% gratuity (lowest package, but check out the website for the others) but it was $399 + 18% for Halloween.  Comes with 2 non-premium bottles, 1 champagne, unlimted mixers, 4 energy drinks.  It also comes with 10 comps + line bypass (more on that later). we negotiated more and some reduced cover because we had 15 people. \\n\\nWas it worth it? I thought so. The place was massively crowded. We went down to scope out the dance floor, and there were so many people moving around that I couldn\\'t stand being downstairs just cr\\nowding with other people. Maybe I\\'m old. Maybe I haven\\'t been to a club for a while. But since I have the choice, I rather be upstairs in the booth than down in the crowd. \\n\\n We didn\\'t have to wait in the \"other\" line, and this line was solely dedicated to bottle service.\\nYou need to check in with Rich at the door, and he\\'s a hard man to get a hold of. I had to chase him down and follow him around. \\nThey give you wrist bands and escort you to the table. \\nOurs were upstairs, and I was told the downstairs area was reserved for those who would spend a lot of $. \\n\\nThe booths area upstairs is really nothing fancy. Just couches, and walls, and  big bar in the middle. \\nWe were lucky to get a booth that overlooked the big window to the dance floor downstairs. It was fun to gawk at people. \\n\\nFor 10 people, the booth was tiny. 2 couches could only fit like 6 people, but since you\\'re up and dancing anyway, it didn\\'t matter much. \\n(note: other people in the booths beside, LOVED to sit on our couch\\nes. *annoyed*)\\n\\nIt would be really unlucky to get the booths to the further side of the area.  It\\'s next to the other room of the club that plays different music than the booths+main dance area. \\n\\n2 bathrooms in the middle of the room. So unnecessary. Not only was it that there were always long line ups for it, but if you just went downstairs, there were TONS of bathroom stalls and usually never a line. If they got rid of this, they could fit another booth. \\nSome poor girl waited in line so long she puked all over the floor. Wonderful.\\n\\nI had fun. But only because we had the booths. In the end, we paid $35 a person. Considering cover itself is $20, I think it\\'s not so bad! We never ordered more bottles than we were given, and cash and carried any extra drinks.\\n#30daysofYelp\\nIf you choose this for your wedding venue, you want opulence and a sense of grandeur. What makes it so, is the high vaulting ceilings, fireplaces and marble floors. It\\'s classy, sophisticated and has an air of extra\\nvagance. \\n\\nWas here for my friends wedding on a cold October weekend. It\\'s not the most easily accessible by public transit because after you get off the bus/streetcar you have to walk a whole bunch, and not fun when you\\'re in a short dress! She did have a shuttle bus going back and forth from Liberty Grand to downtown every half hour, but it was late most times. I\\'m not sure if this is something the venue itself provided. \\n\\nWalking in, there was a coat check, with two ladies manning the coats, just situation in a corner stairwell. There was no covering and I was a little apprehensive about leaving my bag out in the open like that. \\n\\nCocktails was set up really nicely, with the bar in the corner, and a cozy fireplace with couches at the back. \\n\\nThe actual reception room was narrow. The head table at one side and a stage at the other. Almost 30% of the tables were side by side with the head table so you couldn\\'t really see anything. Dance floor was a good size. They also had some lounge', 'actual_label': 34, 'predicted_label': 34}, {'text': 'y chairs setup inside and out side the room. \\n\\nHere\\'s where reviewing someone elses wedding becomes tricky. You need to distinguish between their planning and the venues services.\\nThe food I found to be a bit bland, however, I know they were really picky about their food choices. It might be that the tasting was amazing, and on the day, the mass production became sloppy.\\nWhat I was really disappointed about was the service. \\nIt was served individually, but on most occasions out of the 5 courses, at least 3-4 people on our table was missed. And had to wait for a long time (people almost finished) before the meal came!  I thought it was a basic rule to serve everyone at the table at the same time. Also, serving happened on all sides of me, which wasn\\'t cool. I also found them cold and unfriendly.\\n\\nI also didn\\'t really understand the table placement. Each side seemed to have room enough to move the tables closer to the center, more evenly spaced, but the side I was on had one table pushed\\n up against the wall (right at the projector)where two people could not sit. \\n\\nThe logistics of the place, seemed like everything else happened on time, with no glitches for all I know. \\n\\nOverall a beautiful wedding atmosphere, but just some minor details that could have made it perfect from a venue point of view.\\nThis is one of my favourite Canadian Tire locations. In general I like coming here much more than Home Depot, Rona and the like because the merch is just so well rounded. \\n\\nPrices may not always compare, but when they have sales, boy do they have sales. \\n\\nThe aisles are wide, and things are easy to find. The associates are helpful and the background sing along pop songs help with the shopping mood. \\n\\nIt\\'s one of those stores I tend to wander around and want to buy everything for some reason. \\n\\nThere\\'s a Service Ontario counter right in the store. Seems a little weird, but brings people to the location. The counter is hit or miss on the line up. \\n\\nStarbucks is right downstairs\\n, perfect to peruse the store with a hot beverage in hand.\\nI like the venue especially for an intimate concert like Mika on Friday. For an artist that I think could easily fill 3/4 of the ACC, I love that he chooses to play in smaller places and much more a concert than a show. \\n\\nThere is a large stage in front and two bars on either side. It\\'s all general admission so die hard fans can go straight to the front, and on the floor. \\n\\nWhat I loved was how there was a balcony with a bar up stairs. If you\\'re lunch enough you can get mezzanine seats right at the edge, or on the barstools one level up. There are tables here too, but I think they just take up space. Would recommend coming up here if you can. \\n\\nThe coat check seemed long and cumbersome, and folks were waiting for a while single file. Go up to the balcony and you can it in various places. \\n\\nSound wise, I think it was good for what it was. Upstairs we could hear everything, but not always so clearly when he spoke to us, but I thi\\nnk it\\'s a function of the sound engineers.\\n\\nAND lots of good food options nearby. Free parking on Queen street after 6pm\\nThe Pasta and Pizza here is excellent. One of the few restaurants in the area that is more reasonably priced, the portions were not that small - it was perfect median between full and hungry. \\n\\nIt was crowded on a Friday night. 7pm and we had to wait a bit for a table even though we had a reservation.   The problem was that there was no where to stand and we were a big group tight in the entrance blocking the way for everyone. \\n\\nIts crowded and narrow inside and I was constantly bumped into by patrons and waiters even as I was sitting.\\n\\nFood came prompty, pasta cooked perfectly al dente and bursting with flavour. The pizzas thin and crispy on the bottom.  I would skip the dessert. Got the creme brulee but nothing special and quite telling when they bring it out almost minutes after you ordered it, cold. \\n\\nThe place is super dark and dim. I\\'m suprised the servers don\\'\\nt trip as they run back and forth.\\n\\nUnderstood that they have a high turnover, but like the last time I came. We were shuffled out of there right after we paid the bill. But they were really rude about it. \\nWhen I made the reservation, they said we had the table until 9pm. At before 830 they came to us and asked us to leave (after we paid). I mean, we were already planning to was besides the point.but we had just given the card machine back ! \\nI said, \"we actually have until 9) . And the manager says back to me \"I tod you on the phone you had the table until a certain time\" . I said yes, and it was 9pm!\\n\\nJust find it rude. For this may not come back. I don\\'t need someone to tell me one thing and not keep their word.\\nClosed Monday and Tuesday  - but open on the weekends! I finally got a chance to come here on an early Saturday morning. It\\'s small, but the wait wasn\\'t too long and with good company it goes a lot faster. \\n\\nThe menu had tons of good things on it, and it was supplemented by', 'actual_label': 34, 'predicted_label': 34}, {'text': \" and salsa. The salsa trio didn't light my fire. \\n3. Delayed greet. This is one of my odd pet peeves with service. It really bothers me when it takes longer than 30 seconds to be greeted by my server, and here, it took several minutes. Once we were greeted, service was good, but first impressions matter!\\n\\nOverall, it was a good meal. Like I said, I would do it again.\\nA grass knoll suitable for taking in a concert. There is no assigned seating here, so those that have the best portable seating options will have the best time. According to their website, the lawn holds 3000 people. There is plenty of room to move about, plenty of parking and if you get bored, you can run across the street and go shopping at the Premium Outlets.\\n\\nYou're not going to see U2 here, but for some free Jazz shows or a more local oriented festival, this is a convenient and comfortable spot.\\nHearts up: Valentine's is next week, and you can never go wrong with chocolate. Next to the downright delicious treats, the\\n best thing about Brasado is the heavenly smell. It's like a love potion. One whiff and you're ready to buy every handmade chocolate delight in the store. All of the items are organic and made by their very own chocolatier, so it is next to impossible to beat their quality and knowledge. Their pieces average $1.50/each, and they also offer items by the pound. They have plenty of hearts and thematic airbrushed items (I am fond of chocolates with mini-hearts on the top) to let you know the love of your life you think they're sweet. (Or to indulge yourself in a private chocolate fantasy.)\\nSo far so good! This is just part one of the story as I have not received my clothes back just yet. We stopped in to drop off a batch of dresses, and I couldn't have been more impressed with their kindness, professionalism and knowledge. It is operated by an older couple, and they have all appearances of having been in the business for quite some time. He was very careful to inspect all of the tags on my\\n dresses to be sure they wouldn't use a chemical to damage the material, and even though it isn't a $2/piece dry cleaner, the prices weren't terrible. Cash only! A bit of a disappointment, but if my dresses come out beautifully, I won't complain.\\nFor your basic used casino cards, custom chips, and tables, Spinettis is a clean, organized store that greets you with Elvis tunes as soon as you step out of your car. When I first walked in, I was struck by how neat and organized everything was, which is a good thing. However, the selection lacked the thrill of the unexpected find. I didn't feel as if I was going to make a cool discovery. This isn't a bad thing if you're on a dedicated mission to find certain things like a true collector, but if you're more of a peruser, like myself, it isn't quite a toy chest of surprises. \\n\\nWe went in searching for a die and discovered that their inventory really focuses on cards and chips and the associated accessories, including tables. There were very fe\\nw dice to be found. We had to go elsewhere to stock up on dice. Yes, I was in the market for dice. Actually, just one, so die technically.\\n\\nOverall, worth a stop if you're into cards and chips, but perhaps a bit boring if you just want to see a bunch of random gambling finds!\\nThis may change by the time you read my review, but if you want to see my meal, it is currently being featured in a Slide Show format above: Broccoli & Cheddar Soup, Salad on endless rotation as currently those are the only two pictures on the Yelp listing. This makes me laugh. \\n\\nOn to the review: Quite simply, I am a sucker for Panera's broccoli cheddar soup. In fact, though, I am honestly a sucker for all broc and cheese soups! Regardless, Panera is a good stand by for a quick soup, salad, sandwich type lunch. They do all well, and I generally go with soup and salad. You even get a choice of an additional side: bread, chips or apple. I have eaten at several Panera's, and I would say this one is average. I would \\ndefinitely revisit, but on my initial visit, I felt that the portions were a tad on the small side and a bit sloppy in presentation (salad dressing dripping down the side of the bowl for example). I know it is nit-picky, but at a chain, you expect a certain level of consistent execution. \\n\\nThey also have a nice selection of beverages, including flavored iced teas and blended creations. Plus, free wifi and ample seating.\\nYou don't know tender until you've stuffed your face with a serving of the marinated galbi at Woonam Jung, and that is my recommendation to you: a face stuffing of marinated galbi at Woonam Jung. I am pretty sure it will cure whatever ails you. \\n\\nYes, it is going to cost you more than AYCE options. It will cost you approximately $28 for one order, but you will get a dish that defies culinary logic. This galbi manages to be thick AND tender, which leads me to believe they have a Korean black magic wizard in the back casting tenderizing spells. \\n\\nHowever, they should also\", 'actual_label': 35, 'predicted_label': 35}, {'text': ' hire a wizard to work out their service kinks. It is grand opening still, and they were swamped by all the CES businessmen posses. They were out of tea, out of broccoli, and they managed to mess up our order in every way possible, including running one credit card for the entire bill after we gave them three for a split check. We were there for 3-hours! Someone who didn\\'t eat the bewitched galbi would have probably given them 2-stars based on the service alone.\\n\\nIf fish is your friend, you will also be pretty delighted by the seafood combination, which comes with lobster tail, squid, shrimp and salmon. The seafood lovers at my table were drooling on the bountiful sea offerings as they were laid across the grill. It is a good value, although we think we may have been given a double order? (Refer to paragraph 3.)\\n\\nBanchan were not particularly notable to my dismay. \\n\\nHowever, in the end, Mr. Tender Galbi made up for everything. Seriously, I realize it may be a bit more than you want to \\npay for Korean BBQ, but your pennies will be well spent on this marinated masterpiece. (No need to waste the extra buck on the \"prime,\" unmarinated cousin.)\\nUntil the day I tasted their simple glazed donut, I had always thought, \"A donut is a donut, what\\'s not to like?\" Yes, it was a fool-mouthed, careless, uneducated attitude towards the mighty donut, but when you are talking about fried dough covered in a sugary glaze, it seems like a reasonable attitude. \\n\\nThis was the second stop on our Saturday donut crawl (highly recommended adventure), and when I entered two thoughts entered my head:\\n1. Why is everything behind bars?\\n2. Why does everything in that case look like a dream treat from Willy Wonka?\\n\\nThe answer to the first question: it is a slightly tough part of town, but not any different than where I lived in Atlanta for close to 5 years, so I wasn\\'t running to my car in fear. I just took notice that they were prepared for potential theft. And, rightly so because if I were a thief\\n, I would want to steal these donuts.\\n\\nThe answer to the second question: Because these are some frickin\\' fantastic donuts. Okay, granted, that I had half a glazed donut, but that has been my standard for tasting virtually every donut in town, and the second my teeth bit down into this doughy delight, something was different. The dough was soft and light and melted into my mouth like magic. The glaze appeared to be perfectly fused as my lap was not covered in pesky glaze chips. My husband described it as a \"giant Kripy Kreme,\" which he considers the icon of doughnut perfection, as many do. Personally, I would take this jumbo sized version over those teeny little things any day.  \\n\\nThere are a couple of booths to sit down and enjoy your selections, and the place is incredibly clean despite being older. \\n\\nTheir goods are a bit more expensive (.90 for one), but this isn\\'t just any donut. This donut showed me that in the land of donuts some are truly kings.\\nI am not changing my star rating\\n, but I wanted to share that sadly, I do not recommend the vegetable enchiladas. They are chock full of solid, seasonal vegetables and served in homemade corn tortillas. However, this season, they are covered in a grayish sauce (I think it may be mushroom-inspired?) and served in such a way (one enchilada on top of the other) that the entire dish looks like limp fish. When it came out, I was wondering what the heck my husband ordered, but then realized it was mine. They did have Brussels sprouts, which was exciting, but the flavor was very rich and creamy, which I did not expect. Overall, this dish was my first disappointment.\\nConsider this week my \"car dealership phase\". Given that most of the living world hates buying cars, I feel that it is important to shed some light onto the good (and badder than bad) adventures in carland. Yesterday, I shared a badder than bad, but today I am happy to share a delightful experience! \\n\\nThis is all about my sales experience, as I have never gotten \\nservice because we did not end up purchasing a Rover. So, we\\'re not officially ballin\\', but I really wanted to make it rain at Land Rover. The ride was smooth (but not a limousine for all you Prince fans), and our \"Sales Guide\" was just that cool. First of all, her name was Cookie! Being a \"Misti\" I automatically feel a kinship with peeps that have what I will call \"cute\" names.\\n\\nCookie was super laid back with zero attitude, and she had cuh-razy stories about the myriad of characters that roll through the door. She was also low pressure. She called to follow-up one time, and then she was gone. Now, I liked Cookie, but in when it comes to car salespeople, I like it when they\\'re kind on the lot, and then are kind enough to let me go about my life. \\n\\nCookie really provided an ideal visit to the land of car sales. She is like Glenda in the Land of Oz... or something like that.\\nA great neighborhood restaurant. I just wish it were my \\'hood! When we walked in, we immediately smelled evidence', 'actual_label': 35, 'predicted_label': 35}, {'text': ' of a grill. We were told it was mesquite wood. The space is casual and family-friendly. (I had to resist the call of Tinkerbell to join her in the play area set aside for the little ones.)\\n\\nEverything is very reasonably priced, and the service was great. I ended up ordered the grilled falafel. Two notable facts about the falafel: They are fava. And, yes, they are grilled. I will say that I do prefer fried, but the grilled were great and made me feel a bit better about myself I suppose. For $5.99 (I think), it is probably one of the most affordable dinners you could enjoy at a non-fast food spot, and here you can wash it down with a glass of affordable wine!\\n\\nThey have a big menu, so you should be able to find something for everyone, and they feature special menus for special occasions, like Valentine\\'s.\\nHow can you get better than a 24-hour auto parts store? It is just so darn convenient, perhaps too much so. I have found myself here after 10pm two times in the past week with my car o\\nbsessed husband. Both times it has been slammed, but we\\'ve received courteous service and some spark plugs. On our last visit, they didn\\'t have what we needed, but they were quick to suggest where we could find what we were looking for. And, I am pretty sure they will match competitors\\' prices. Whether you are car-obsessed or just in desperate need of a part at 2am, they will get it done!\\nDonuts always taste better with a big dose of atmosphere. Ideally, you want your donut to have character, a story to tell. And, the orbs at Donut Hut have quite the narrative, and yes, they are delicious. Plus, they have these overnight hours, an interesting, but apparently common feature of a mom and pop shop. When it\\'s time to make the donuts, they open\\'er up.\\n\\nI was bummed not to find wood paneling. However, there were walls filled with photos of the owner in full soldier gear posing with all shapes and sizes of American enforcement, from military to police. If they wear a uniform, he has posed wit\\nh them. In most of the photos, he carries a sign that announces he owes his life to America. He is Cambodian. He was not there, so I do not know the whole story. My imagination believes it must be an epic one. \\n\\nStop #3 on our donut crawl, and the standard glazed were all gone, so we went with the glaze twist. I\\'ll just say I am ready to twist again! The dough was not too dense, and their glaze had a distinct flavor that stood out compared to other glazes. Not sure if there is a secret ingredient... maybe it\\'s patriotism. \\n\\nI saw a sign announcing French crullers on Friday, Saturday and Sunday, so if that is your vice, take note.\\nShucks, Norm, I think we may have caught you on a bad day. We heard from a waitress that there was a new cook in the kitchen, and perhaps our experience was a byproduct of this. \\n\\nThe good: Breakfast is cheap. The bill for two was a little over $13. \\n\\nHowever, starting with the menu, the cafe did not impress us on a Saturday morning. I am an omelet eater, and \\nthe omelet selection was limited to very average ingredients: spinach, mushroom, ham, bacon, green peppers and the like. Call me spoiled, but I really love to see fancy-named omelets with inventive twists. I decided to go with the Veggie. It took over 30-minutes to receive our order, and the food we received was standard fare. The omelet was on the smaller side, and the ingredients were not generous enough. It tasted like well-done eggs, not like a bounty of veggies and cheese. The hashbrowns were simply hashbrowns. \\n\\nThe limited selection (although I am intrigued by their lunch time curry), food quality and slow execution left us disappointed. Maybe the secret is to stick to the pancakes!\\nIt had been too long. I almost wanted to slap myself for going without such impeccable food for so long. When we decided to stick to brown rice and no noodles, we stopped visiting because when we would call, they would say, \"No brown rice,\" but after months, we decided to call again yesterday, and he\\nard, \"Yes, we have brown rice.\"\\n\\nOh happy day.\\n\\nI was smart to give Pan Asian 5 stars the first two times. Massaman is definitely the dish to devour. What really struck me yesterday, the quality of ingredients. Everything is fresh and top notch, even their tofu tastes better. I hope they keep up the brown rice because I need this in my life.\\nYes, I lament the lack of gaggles of independent coffee shops in Las Vegas, but whatcha gonna do? Open up a coffee shop? Yes, you could do that, but for now, you\\'ve got to make do. This location is my east side spot for meetings over coffee, or rather tea.\\n\\nThe service has always been social and sweet taking time to ask how my day is going instead of just slinging beverages. The location is big, so I have never had a problem finding a seat, unlike many other chain spots, and they have Wi Fi. On my most recent visit, I did an internal cheer for their lineup of iced teas. I went with an iced green tea, and it was just what I wanted- a simple, no fril', 'actual_label': 35, 'predicted_label': 35}, {'text': 'ls green tea. \\n\\nThe only minor nuisance is the locked bathroom. I am challenged by that key. I fiddle with the knob for like 2 minutes every time trying to break into the washroom. \\n\\nOther than that, this location is a winner for me!\\nI have received great Genius Bar service at this location. The appointment ran on time. The solution was quick. The service was friendly. My husband\\'s phone finally smartened up at this location, and that was also a pain-free experience. Ultimately, it\\'s an Apple Store, which means it\\'s a happy, fun place in my book.\\nWhy is a decent salad so hard to find in Las Vegas? Perhaps salad is to Vegas as kryptonite is to Superman; I can not tell you how many nights I am driving around thinking: \"Man, I would love a good salad.\" (This is not an invitation for salad jokes. I am serious.)\\n\\nFollowing some research, my first trip to the Peppermill was actually in search of a good salad, but every subsequent trip has been for the rather special ambiance. The salads are \\nimpressive: huge, fresh, and creative for a diner-type joint. Plus, in my experience, they grill up the most perfect chicken breast. Still, even if the salads were iceberg blah, I would have to make the occasional Peppermill journey to savor the fabulous interior complete with artificial cherry tree grove. Yes, it is best described as a grove. From the booths to the blossoms, you definitely feel as if you are experiencing something best described as Vintage Vegas as the place opened in 1972. The friendly servers in their equally vintage uniforms complete the experience nicely.\\n\\nIn addition to salads, the Peppermill does dessert and dessert-inspired cocktails well. They have an oatmeal cookie drink that tastes 100% like an oatmeal cookie. Even if you are not hungry, who can pass up that concoction? Even better, you can sip on your cookie in The Fireside Lounge located in the back of the restaurant. It features, and I quote, a \"romantic flaming pool\", and hot pink is the design scheme. M\\night as well call it \"heaven\".\\n\\nInsiders tell me that around 5am is when the best people watching occurs, but if you can\\'t find an excuse to go at 5am, you should still find an excuse to go sometime.\\nYou will earn bonus stars if you: A. Offer Brown Rice Sushi B. Serve Me Peruvian Corn\\n\\nI didn\\'t know that B was true until I had the pleasure of nibbling kernels of this P-country delight with chopsticks at SushiSamba, so another bonus for educating me about a delicious snack. Snacking is what brought us here. We were wandering around following a mini beer fest and decided we should eat again. When the hostess told us they could do brown rice sushi rolls, we were sold. I really applaud this option, and I hope it will become more popular.\\n\\nWe sat at the sushi bar, and even there, I could appreciate this was an all-eyes-on-fun atmosphere. Attention big parties looking to par-tay this should be on your short list. \\n\\nOur server was super sweet and helpful. I ordered some miso soup and asparagu\\ns and chicken robata. The miso soup did feature cilantro, but I can\\'t say it went to anyplace that miso hasn\\'t been already. The robata were as well prepared and flavorful as any I have had in town. And, oh that Peruvian corn: giant kernels of sweet maize. It came with the robata, and I thought it was divine. I also had several bites of the passion fruit shrimp ceviche, and it was a fruit sensation for sure. My husband ate the brown rice sushi, and I was happy for him to have the option. Overall, the menu and execution are fusion done right. \\n\\nThe server confused my chicken for a beef, really no big deal, but management was quick to intervene and remove the chicken from the bill. This flat out amazed me. \\n\\nYes, prices are Strip prices (but they aren\\'t outrageous), and I only sampled some light bites, but based on my overall experience from atmosphere to service, if you are looking for a fun spot to enjoy some creative eats or just some fabulous light bites on the Strip, this is a prett\\ny complete package.\\nSome places simply make you smile, and Rocket Fizz is definitely one of those places. I don\\'t have a big sweet tooth and only indulge a true ginger beer once every couple of months, but the rows of gleaming soda bottles, walls of retro posters and bins of saltwater taffy at Rocket Fizz make me grin ear to ear. Walking in makes you feel as if you have entered an alternate universe, kind of Willy Wonka. \\n\\nPassion is contagiously delightful, and Rocket Fizz is a small store with a big passion for soda and candy. The store features 100s of flavors of soda from Rat Bastard root beer to original formula Dr. Pepper without that pesky corn syrup. If the desert dry has you parched, there is a good selection of cold ones ready to pop. The store sells only glass bottles, no aluminum pop tops. Singles are $1.89, or you can get a four pack for $6.99. Apparently, their best seller is Leninade, a mysterious pinkish cola with a citrusy flavor. (The recipe is top secret, but not pro', 'actual_label': 35, 'predicted_label': 35}, {'text': \"tected by KGB.) We ended up grabbing a couple of root beers and a couple of ginger ales. If you are having a party, I definitely think a fridge of specialty colas to go along with your other cold ones will make a big hit. It is also a great place to keep in mind for gifts for your friend who loves root beer or orange soda.\\n\\nIf you need a bigger sugar rush, you can stock up on candy as well. The store features everything from Mallo Cups to Whoppers and bins and bins of saltwater taffy.\\n\\nThe owner was super helpful, but he has only been in the soda business for a couple of months, so you might be best served by doing a little research before you go, or on Saturdays, there is a free tasting from 1pm-4pm, so you can do some first-hand research. Browsing and bopping your head to the owner's favorite psychedelic soundtrack is a great way to spend a lazy Saturday afternoon (right after you eat a waffle at WaffleS Cafe across the street!).\\nI had gone too long without a Pan Asian visit! Stopped\\n in for lunch today and kicked myself for all the days of delicious eats I have missed by not going here. We tried something different: linguine. Yes, I know you are doubtful that an Asian place has a worthy linguine dish, but the stir fried linguine has the ideal wok flavor. I will order it again. David and Lisa are still fun and friendly, and she let us sample some of her chicken wings. Perfectly crisp and moist. I hope they hit the menu soon!\\nSo, the little things make me very happy, and the little thing at Border Grill is that for .50 a bottle you can get house sparkling water. I would probably go there to sit at the bar and drink sparkling water because that is the kind of nerd I am. Go ahead, make fun of me.\\n\\nThe other little thing that makes me happy here is the patio. It is an outdoor/indoor thing because there is a roof, but you are outside. This protects you from the elements, and if it is a little chilly, they have plenty of furnace power to keep you toasty. The one potentia\\nl hazard is being musically assaulted by a questionable poolside wedding singer. It happened on our most recent visit, and it was mildly painful, oddly entertaining. \\n\\nNow for the food, you must ask for the spicy salsa. They don't bring it out automatically, but if you like heat, you will need this. I am a big fan of the tomatillo salsa as well. The sweet corn tamales don't have the traditional trappings of a tamale, but if you remotely like corn and sweet, you're going to enjoy these. Both times I have had mahi mahi - once as a grilled entree and once in the fish tacos- and, both times I have been pleased. Their beans are delicious, and the plantains were great as well. \\n\\nI will say I don't love the menu. I always feel as if I am looking for something that I can't find, namely a spectacular dish with lots of incredible vegetables or simply a more creative vegetarian option. It is always something I look for just because I love vegetables. They do have a mushroom entree, but, I would l\\nove to see a green vegetable really shine.\\n\\nEven so, if you see a girl sipping sparkling water by the bottle with some tomatillo salsa on the patio, that's probably me, and I'm definitely happy.\\nDisclaimer: I am not even close to a shabu expert. I have had it once or twice, but as a rule, I have a little issue with places where I have to be responsible for the end product. For example, Mongolian BBQ scares the pee out of me! I don't cook for a reason.\\n\\nSo, perhaps the charming company distracted me from my usual disappointment with do-it-yourself dining experiences because I had a good time and liked the food. \\n\\nThen again, I did have something for the first time last night: sukiyaki. Unlike shabu, the end product is not a soup. You simply dunk your ingredients in the teriyaki-flavored broth to give them a little sweet, little salty flavor before you dip them in additional sauce (hot, teriyaki or peanut). Then, you devour them with rice. Speaking of rice, I really liked this rice, it w\\nas almost like broken rice, and while generally, I barely make it through one bowl of rice, I cleaned this bowl in record time. The sauces were also well-executed, especially with the addition of the pickled daikon. I love daikon!\\n\\nI kept it simple, cheap and vegetarian by only ordering the $12 veggie and tofu platter, and this is more than enough because you get bottomless refills on vegetables, noodles and tofu. Note: Tofu noodles come with your order, so you don't really need to order a side of udon noodles, unless you just have to have udon. \\n\\nService was a little forgetful, but super nice. The interior was small with room for only about 30, but clean and charming.\\n\\nAt the end of the night, I really just had some fancy cabbage and tofu for dinner, but it was fun and tasty.\\nJust have to throw my 5-stars onto the pile of other 5-star reviews. I first visited the Pinball Hall of Fame as a tourist. I was looking for all of the hidden gems of Las Vegas, and the Hall of Fame is definitel\", 'actual_label': 35, 'predicted_label': 35}, {'text': \"y a gem. Now that I am a local, I visit at least once a month. It is a favorite hang for local artists; you can find their names on many of the high scores!\\n\\nI am not a die hard pinball player probably because I am not very good. Apparently, there is definitely a strategy and techniques, but I have not mastered them yet. Still, you can have an amazing time just walking up and down the aisles and taking in the machines as whirring, buzzing art. They have machines from as far back as the 50s all the way through the present. Pointer: If you are not a great pinball player, the Looney Tunes machine is pretty forgiving. And, when you get totally frustrated with watching your pinball disappear time after time, go to the back corner and play some Stiga hockey. Yes, one of the goalies is sideways, but that makes it even more charming and hilarious.\\n\\nAs people have said, the Hall of Fame is amazing because all of the machines are working and playable for a couple of quarters. We once had friends\\n who fantasized that the slot machines in Las Vegas still accepted quarters. They showed up at our house with bags of quarters. We took them directly to the Hall of Fame.\\n\\nIt is also amazing because it is a wonderful labor of love. It was originally one man's vision, but now there is a board and other staff members. They are incredibly passionate about what they do. Because it is a non-profit, revenues are donated to various charitable causes. \\n\\nThe new location is great and convenient to the Liberace Museum, so you can take the free shuttle to Liberace and knock out two Vegas gems at once with no cab fare. Five cheers for pinball!\\nI am very happy they are open 24-hours and happen to fall directly on my route to and from the airport, so regardless the time, if I am in a mad dash to or a hunger-crazed return from the airport, I can pop in and grab a quick, cheap snack. The quality of the snack, however, is mediocre. The tacos aren't huge, but they also aren't expensive. However, they ar\\ne constructed with one corn tortilla, which falls victim to dreaded soggy taco whereby the contents of the taco escape onto your plate. Spoon is required. The flavor of the taco is ok, but not amazing, and unfortunately, the salsa bar was a total wreck when we visited. I wasn't inspired to douse up the taco. The spot is big, so there is plenty of room for sitting, and the service was kind and quick. For what Pepe's is, it is ok, but if I am not in a hurry or have other options that are open, it wouldn't be my first stop.\\nIf you're looking for a $5.99, quick, nutritious and delicious lunch special, then this could hit the spot! I finally tried the food counter at Rani's. They have sweets and snacks, but they also have vegetarian lunch thali, a tray filled with savory Indian dishes. It includes rice, dal, and two additional curries, plus it is served with bread. The eggplant curry was definitely the hit of the afternoon with big chunks of eggplant and a perfectly balanced seasoning. It i\\ns very informal. You order at the counter, and there are only 4 or 5 tables. After you finish eating, you can do some grocery shopping. We picked up a couple bars of Chandrika! Definitely add this to your list of quick, cheap ethnic lunch delights!\\nI think I have been living in Vegas too long, as 2 of my last three meals have been at buffet places! Help! Someone rescue me from the slippery slope of AYCE or soon my arteries will cease functioning.\\n\\nOne of the 2 places was Wooche, a Korean BBQ buffet. For me, the highlight of the evening was the adorable turtle living in the lobby that popped his head up to say goodbye. The interior feels like a cafeteria, and overall, the combination of lighting and offerings gave the general impression of not being the freshest. \\n\\nThe miso soup was okay. I had a large plate of their banchan offerings, and I didn't find one that I wanted to eat endlessly. Each offering was like a bizarro offering: kimchi that had a sweetness, bean sprouts that were too \\nsalty, radish that was too sour. Given that the main attraction to Korean for me is the banchan, this was a big disappointment. From the fast food bar, I sampled the lomein, and it too had an odd flavor, heavy on the white pepper. \\n\\nAs for the meat, I nibbled on this and that. The larger hunks of meat were unimpressive, like a side of meat you may have been served in elementary school. The definite standouts were the pork selections, spicy chicken and the bulgogi. Actually, the bulgogi dipped in the jalapeno soy sauce was delicious, and the culinary highlight of my experience. \\n\\nI think there are better options in Vegas, perhaps a bit more expensive, but when it comes to meat, I am willing to pay for quality over quantity. Meat coma is not a good thing. I was leaning towards 2 stars, but the service is nice, value is pretty good, and I admit I have an innate bias against buffets of any variety, except Indian.\\nCalling all book lovers and book clubs: Elixir is really an ideal spot to han\", 'actual_label': 35, 'predicted_label': 35}, {'text': 'g out with your book or your book loving friends because they have something that is hard to come by around Vegas, couches! I seriously think there may be only one other coffee shop in Vegas that has a couch, and Elixir has plural... couchES. Big ones. Given the comfy seating, I was disappointed to find no Wi-Fi! However, it is still an ideal setting for a book club or for a solo bookworm to curl up and read. It is definitely a casual spot. \\n\\nThe menu is vegan and vegetarian friendly with sandwiches, salads, soups and perfect snacks. I didn\\'t sample a wide variety of their food offerings, but I tried the hummus/baba platter which comes with cucumbers, carrots celery and pita. It was the perfect, healthy snack. I had no objections to finishing off the plate by myself! \\n\\nThey have a selection of teas, and I had an iced green tea. I thought the tea flavor could have been better. It tasted a bit over steeped. However, the glass was never empty thanks to a super attentive, sweet server who \\nwas quick with the refills! If this were on my side of town, I would take advantage of the couch real estate often!\\nStolen words sometimes work best when you\\'re stuck for a beginning. So thank you Rehner Banham: \\n\\n\"Visually Las Vegas is the triumph of human skill over great odds, all probability and moral law.\" \\n\\nWhen I first read that deft sentence, the little voice in my head screamed, \"Yes.\" I started every tour I led at the Neon Museum with that  tidbit. Banham may have been addressing the explosion of neon and steel, but this thought parallels the reason I love Las Vegas: the sheer humanity puts a Randian grin on my face, and I am not talking about lack of taxes. (I share an alma mater with a Clinton, so I bleed liberal.) I have never thought Ayn just wanted to save money. She wanted us to celebrate mankind, and for better or worse, Vegas has, Vegas does and Vegas always will. Vegas is not bigger than the little guy. The littlest guy in Vegas is like the proverbial flutter of a bu\\ntterfly wing. \\n\\nWhat do I mean? Vegas defies reason. There is little reason we should be kicking it in this desert. Unlike other cities, we did not grow thanks to a warm water port or fertile land. Existence here is no thanks to a natural bounty. The bounty, however meager or strong, is here thanks to the endeavors, pursuits and dreams of men and women. That enthralls me. From the train to the dam to the bomb to casinos and so on, humanity has carried Vegas for better or worse. We blow buildings up because Vegas is energy and facades can\\'t contain that.\\n\\nI am not saying Vegas is pretty, but complexity never is, and guess what, neither is simplicity. It\\'s easy to see Vegas as a disgusting warehouse of tired fantasies, but when you decide you don\\'t want to be rich or beautiful, to travel to exotic places... then, you can cast your stones. Saddling up on your ivory horse and passing judgment on whatever people choose to experience here is an imperialism of dangerous roots. To pretend you \\nknow something the rest of us don\\'t is a thinly veiled attempt to feel intellectual.\\n\\nAway from the philosophy of it all, I simply love this city. I love the library system. I love boba and foot massages at 2am. I love shopping at midnight. I love the weather. I love the ease of driving and parking. (NYC never sold me on public transportation.) I love the small town feel with the big town amenities. I love Spring Mountain Road. I love no hurricanes. I love the airport. I love neon. \\n\\nOh, and to those who think that the \"no culture\" line demonstrates your learned pedigree, whether you like it or not Vegas is so thick with American culture that you could almost cut it and serve it on a hot dog bun. In fact, I am pretty sure that is what they\\'re doing down on Fremont. Did I hear you scoff? Have you read \"Learning from Las Vegas?\" Did I see you at Off the Strip? Have you checked out the Kahlo exhibit at Barrick? What about Neon Reverb? Have you toured the Neon Museum? Celebrated Day of the\\n Dead at Winchester? Attended a performance by the Contemporary Dance Theater? Have you tried the cuisine of Spring Mountain Road? Talk is cheap, and I personally know two people who moved to Vegas and within less than a year created something impactful: Neon Reverb and the Las Vegas Halloween Parade. If you can\\'t appreciate what is offered or create the change you want to see (which is so simple to do here), then take Mr. Jackson\\'s advice and talk to that person in the mirror. \\n\\nIn conclusion, our rockabillies could kick any city\\'s hipsters\\' butts, and in case you didn\\'t notice, we didn\\'t elect Sharon Angle. However, someone has been known to elect Arnold Schwarzenegger.\\nThe brand new sports book compelled me to write a review. Silverton is a solid locals spot for gambling, drinking and eating, and this review is for the casino only, as I haven\\'t stayed on property.\\n\\nParking is always easy, and if you park in the deck, you will walk right into the new sports book featuring big bright ', 'actual_label': 35, 'predicted_label': 35}, {'text': 'screens and comfy seating. It isn\\'t huge, but when I was there it didn\\'t seem crowded.\\n\\nOther noteworthy attractions include the Bass Pro Shop that is attached, Twin Creeks steakhouse and the delightfully kitschy Mermaid Lounge featuring real, live mermaids in the aquarium. (At least as real and live as they will likely ever be!) Plus, there\\'s a little \"trailer\" that has a bowling lane or two for a small group. I have always wanted an excuse to have a party in there. \\n\\nThe overall atmosphere is pretty laid back and not deathly smoky. The food court has a Starbuck\\'s if that\\'s your thing, and if you have a sweet tooth, there\\'s a gelato counter in the back corner.\\n\\nMermaids, bowling alley trailers and gelato are a combination hard to find elsewhere.\\nThey no longer have a Mr. Kim roll. We stopped in today, and when I asked, the nice lady looked at me confused. To make matters worse, we did purchase an alternative pastry, and they do not offer a complimentary glass of tap water. When we ask\\ned, they said we would have to pay. I think that is a little unreasonable. We got the Mammoth roll, and it was just ok.\\nIf you\\'re in The Venetian, Noodle Asia is an a-ok option for some late night sustenance. Yes, it is more expensive than Spring Mountain Road, and yes, as you may have guessed, the menu is noodle-heavy, but there are some solid dishes for snacking. Just ask for what you like without being beholden to the menu options. \\n\\nWe went in looking for a good garlic stir-fried vegetable without sauce and a spicy, soft noodle. We asked the waitress for just that, and we ended up with a well-executed bok choy and a spicy black bean noodle that wasn\\'t exactly on the menu. The noodle was technically Si Jiu Beef, but it is traditionally a crispy noodle, and we wanted chicken. Our waitress was able to modify the order no problem, so special orders don\\'t upset them! \\n\\nI thought both dishes were delicious, especially because they came to the table piping hot. It was a late night, need t\\no sober up snack for us, not dinner, and it hit the spot just right.\\nIn case you\\'re thinking about heading here for tempura (I realize that is not likely...but just in case), I wouldn\\'t recommend. However, their name is Go Wild Sushi, not Go Wild Tempura, so I won\\'t totally discount their offerings. The restaurant is spacious and an unexpected beauty. And, I appreciate the gigantic projection for catching Sunday football or some other can\\'t miss programming. The service was also friendly. However, the tempura shrimp were baby food soft, and the vegetables didn\\'t have quite the crisp you expect of tempura. Was it a poor ordering choice on my part? Perhaps, but still, shouldn\\'t a girl be able to get some fine fried items on a cloudy afternoon?\\nIf I cooked (or had actually spent the time to master Ms. Sahni\\'s Classic Indian Cooking instead of using it as decoration in my kitchen), this would be close to nirvana, but since I don\\'t cook, this place simply makes me wish I could cook... so I \\ncould be close to nirvana. They have an aisle with bags of spices bigger than a baby, and the aisle is wide, clean, and well lit. The entire place is well lit and spacious. This is definitely the largest Indian market in town.\\n\\nFor those that don\\'t cook, there is a row of boxed Indian meals and a nice freezer selection of items as well. We actually went there to purchase some of the boxed meals to ship to a friend who lives in the middle of Northern California and misses ethnic food. Good call on our part, as they had a nice selection from more than one company. \\n\\nWhen I was there, they were not serving chaat, but they did have a counter of Indian sweets that were tempting. I resisted.\\n\\nThe only thing I didn\\'t find was Chandrika Ayurvedic Soap. When I was there, I suddenly wanted to purchase some, but alas, I didn\\'t see any. Leave it to me to be distracted from all the wonderful cooking ingredients to go on a quest for soap.\\nThe Market LV is a charming edition to Tivoli that promises m\\nore creative, locally-owned spots for knocking out some shopping from cupcakes to wedding gowns and everything in between. It is a second level spot with small shop spaces available to lease. It has the feel of an urban loft with lots of exposed surfaces and concrete floors, which lends me to believe I am visiting some edgy, on-the-brink neighborhood when I am actually in Summerlin. Current tenants include Cupkates, a candy shop, a shop that specializes in board games, a home goods spot, a clothing boutique, a custom wedding gown shop, a spot for cheese, a wine bar is coming soon I think, and there is even a Fashion Camp of some sort. Oh, and a jewelry store that I could have done some damage at if given the time. I don\\'t think the shops all have consistent hours, so you may arrive to find you can\\'t have a cupcake, but overall, I think the concept is great, and I am eager to see what else will open up here. I will definitely keep it top of mind as the holidays near and gift-getting ens', 'actual_label': 35, 'predicted_label': 35}, {'text': 'ues!\\nLast Friday morning I woke up, looked outside my window and thought, \"Oh my, there\\'s a turkey by the pool.\" Yes, I thought this was odd. I had no idea turkeys liked water, but more importantly I was not aware of a desert turkey. Upon closer inspection, I realized it was a duck. \\n\\nI, being the hysterical wife that I can be, immediately called my traveling husband to tell him the shocking news. He freaks out when a songbird comes within 100-feet of the pool, so the news of a duck peering over the edge of our cement pond really upset him. \"Get rid of it. If other ducks smell duck oil we\\'ll have an entire colony in our pool,\" he informed me. So, I ran outside, grabbed the pool net and attempted to shoo it away, but it did what any sensible duck would do, it jumped in the pool. Laughing hysterically, I called my husband to let him know the good news.\\n\\nEventually, I chased the duck out of the pool, and I soon realized the poor thing was bleeding. What to do? I wasn\\'t sure if animal cont\\nrol dealt with wild animals, but I called them up. A nice man was at my house within an hour. He was probably one of the nicest public workers I have ever met. He was very kind to the duck and to me. We ended up bonding over a duck chase, as it took both of us to get the little lady. During the process, she ended up taking at least three long, submerged laps of the pool. If my husband\\'s duck oil theory is correct, we better learn how to whistle Old McMisti had a farm with some extra duck verses. (I am not about to tell him the duck pooped in the pool too!)\\n\\nI have dealt with animal control previously when a neighbor\\'s dog was roaming about the neighborhood delivering \"treats\" on everyone\\'s lawn, and on that occasion, I had the same experience: kind and prompt service. In a city known for less than stellar public services, somehow animal control is doing their less than sexy job quite well.\\nThe land of beef in the heart of Vegas! Yes, I know some of you think I am a vegetarian, and I do\\n love my greens. But don\\'t let my leafy loves fool you! I can eat a steak with the best of them, and that is exactly what I did at Rincon De Buenos Aires. \\n\\nIt is not fancy, and the service is casual, i.e. we had to get up to get drink refills. But, the spot feels authentic (even though I am in no way an Argentine expert). They were showing a soccer game on their televisions, and it wasn\\'t being broadcast in English. That is when I decided the place was legit.  \\n\\nAs others have noted, the chimichurri sauce deserves to be poured generously on everything. It is delicious and fresh. We ordered the meat fest for 2 (I think that is an accurate translation), and it came on a miniature charcoal grill with two filets, two skirt steaks and 2 short ribs for $30. The meat wasn\\'t incredible, but the value is! We also ordered the mixed green salad which is a large bowl of leafy lettuce, thinly sliced red onions and tomatoes served simply with oil and vinegar. It is also a value at $4.95!\\n\\nWe finish\\ned the meal with some coffee and a latte, and we were both pleasantly surprised by some wonderfully strong brews. We will definitely be back for beef, a side of greens and a buzz.\\nThe pastry update: I don\\'t know if Mr. Kim is married, but ladies, if you\\'re lookin\\' for a man, I would give strong consideration to this Kim fellow based solely on his namesake pastry: The Mr. Kim roll. It is some magic combination of red bean and peanut, and I think possibly crack. I could be wrong on that last ingredient, but this thing was so tasty that I almost forgot to eat my red bean buns. It takes an act of the divine to make me forget my red bean buns. I don\\'t know. Maybe I am overselling it. I think I will have to go back right now to make sure I am not leading you astray.\\nThe brown rice bibimbap earns my vote of confidence! It is the only place we have found that will do this around town, and even though I didn\\'t try it, I was pleased by the option. I did try the $8 Spicy Chicken combo that you ca\\nn also get with brown rice. It comes with a little side salad, and of course, my favorite: banchan! As I recalled from their other location, they serve up very solid banchan, possibly my second favorite in town thanks to the variety, freshness and flavor. As for the spicy chicken, I would definitely order it again. I may not be making a special trip North for Jun\\'s, but I am happy to report they are dishing up delectable fare at a reasonable price. And, when you combine that with banchan, how can you go wrong?\\nSammy\\'s is the perfect any and all occasion hang with something for everyone. It\\'s the type of place that I know my parents will find something they\\'ll love, and I know because I have taken both my parents here. The place is clean. The atmosphere is nice, especially if you can take advantage of the outdoor fire pit, and the service is always friendly. \\n\\nWhen my parents aren\\'t in town, this Sammy\\'s ranks highly for being open 24-hours and having a smoke-free bar area with video po', 'actual_label': 35, 'predicted_label': 35}, {'text': 'ker to enjoy your a.m. eats. I don\\'t play video poker, but I appreciate that they offer this diversion without allowing those patrons to smoke and ruin my \\'za.\\n\\nAfter several visits and a little menu adventure, I have pretty much nailed down my go-to items at Sammy\\'s. I rarely stray from these items, as experience has demonstrated that these are truly the best:\\n1. Arugula and Pear Pizza: I really think this is their most superb pie. It has Gorgonzola cheese and some thinly sliced prosciutto. The combination of the sweet pears and salty prosciutto is incredible. Plus, you basically get a side salad right on top. I always get the whole wheat crust (love the option!). The crust is rubbed with chili oil I think, which gives it this nice spice.\\n2. Chinese Chicken Salad: Grilled chicken  breast, napa cabbage, bok choy, carrots, bell peppers, sesame seeds, cilantro, scallions, mandarin oranges and Ginger Asian dressing... what\\'s there not to like? Any salad with cilantro makes me happy, and t\\nhen they throw in some ginger!?\\n3. Fruit Iced Tea: Delicious brewed iced tea. It is impossible not to drink about 20 glasses of this. \\n\\nThe duck tacos and sliders are also quality, but for the most part, I stick to the above. I am a creature of delicious habit.\\nThe Mr. was craving whole fish yesterday evening. Over the Christmas holiday we had a rather yummy whole fish with the family in New Jersey, so maybe he was homesick. \\n\\nMore than likely, he just likes delicious whole fish.\\n\\nA couple of weeks ago we had asked our favorite waitress at Thai Noodle where she liked to eat. Being a college kid, she said she spent a lot of time hanging at the 24-hour IHOP on Rainbow partially because it is 24-hours and partially because there is a really great waitress there. Besides pancake combos, she said she really enjoyed a hot and sour whole fish at Capital Seafood. I can\\'t tell you if the waitress at IHOP is really that great, but I can give you the run down on the whole fish at Capital.\\n\\nThe Mr\\n. loved it. It is a whole flounder pan fried with hot and sour flavors. It is delivered piping hot with a pile of jalapenos on top. I must warn you that the sour smell is intense if you get a deep whiff, definitely a fermented sauce lurking in the mix, but the flavor is great-- kind of like a sophisticated McNuggets\\' sweet and sour. (Be careful because if you accidentally order the SWEET and sour I think you will be in for a bigger dose of fermented smell. I overheard the owner tell a table that not too many people can handle the sweet and sour.) I think the sauces are more Vietnamese than Chinese, as the restaurant is half Vietnamese, and on the Chinese menu the dishes also have Vietnamese names. There is also a completely separate Vietnamese menu.\\n\\nIn addition to the fish, we ordered green beans in garlic sauce without meat. (Always important to make that clear at Asian restaurants.) I could imagine someone complaining about the beans being greasy because the whole time I was stuffin\\ng them in my mouth I was thinking, \"These can\\'t be good for me.\" Still, my taste buds approved the perfect combination of garlic, spiciness and grease. Plus, the green beans were wilted exactly to my taste. I can\\'t stand when green beans are all waxy and squeaky when you bite into them. Blame my Southern mom for raising me on overcooked vegetables. \\n\\nThe pot of white rice was super hot. The service was friendly. The food was delivered quickly. All in all it was a positive experience, but our next whole fish adventure will probably be testing out the frying service at the fish counter of Ranch 99. (That place has to be the nicest smelling Asian supermarket I have ever entered.)\\n\\nThe Mr. said he would definitely eat the whole fish at Capital again, but when it comes to food, we seem to always be searching for the next better thing. I am sticking to three stars because eating two dishes does not really qualify me to bestow more.\\nSundubu replaced pho as my go to soupy fix about six months \\nago. Ever since discovering the spicy, tofu delight of this Korean stew, I\\'ve lost interest in pho. Maybe it\\'s the banchan. Sorry pho, but if you want to compete, you\\'re gonna have to bring something else to the table (literally). \\n\\nSo, when we pulled into the shopping center on Eastern and had a choice of Lemongrass Café or Jun\\'s, there was no competition even though Lemongrass is the clear Yelp star winner. I am really surprised Jun\\'s has only three stars. Perhaps I was just starving that day or perhaps I was overjoyed to find kimchi and sundubu in an unexpected spot, but I really enjoyed my meal. \\n\\nMy hub and I both had vegetarian sundubu. Mine came out a bit more flavorful and spicier, so perhaps there is some inconsistency in their dishes. Even so, I ate my entire bowl and thought it definitely held its own. The banchan were uniformly delicious. The kimchi was addictively spicy; the seaweed had a wonderful sweetness, and the bean sprouts had a white pepper kick. They even had cucu', 'actual_label': 35, 'predicted_label': 35}, {'text': \"also got to new Chumlee at the plaza next door which is owned by shop.\\nDecent service, tasty wings, salads and pizzas.

Staff is friendly and attentive.\\nStaff could be friendlier but overall good store that is organized and consistently has their shelves stocked. Pharmacy closes early in weekends and stays open until 10pm during the week.\\nAmazing service and delicious ice cream. There are 3 different sizes of ice cream you can order from. The biggest I believe is an 8 ounce cup which can fit 8 different flavors. They overfill the cup big time! I ordered 2 flavors - peanut butter chocolate and some other chocolate/caramel that came with pretzels. Both were amazing. Sample before you buy. \\n\\nThere's also a breakfast and lunch menu that looks legit. I'll have to come back and check try some of those ite\\nms.

There's a pool and basketball court, too.\\nNice looking store. Very clean and organized. Staff is friendly, too. Prices aren't bad. I was surprised at the variety at items as this place sells clothes, accessories like wallets, watches, sunglasses and snacks. Very impressed and will come back.\\nWho doesn't love Quiktrip? They're the blue print of what\\n a gas station/convenience store should be. Gas pumps are clean, staff is friendly, and hot foods are a 10 for price and for the fact this is a gas station. Good drink and slushee options, too.\\nWorth the price. Fast and always ready. Pretty consistent in taste and freshness. If you want something other than pepperoni or cheese, call ahead and order. The deep dish is pretty good.\\nI love Oregano's and they seem to know how to hire nice and happy people at all locations. The servers here are attentive and accommodating. My favorite appetizer is the garlic bread with cheese, entree is the numero uno stuffed pizza and all of the pizza cookie desserts are awesome!\\nHuge array of books. Store is clean, staff is friendly and the location is decent. This store manages to book top level talent. Prices are not too bad either.\\nThis mall is busy and I understand why. It houses all of the major stores. The food stands are also worth the visit. Aunt Annie's and Mrs. Fields are delicious! Both Apple an\\nd Microsoft hold residencies here so be sure to pay them a visit!\\nLocated inside Uptown Alley. Place must've been short staffed since we waited 30 minutes for a table but there were a ton that were free. Fried mozzarella were really good. Fish taco, traditional chicken wings and fries were average. Good drink options though.\\nLove coming here just to watch the peaceful lake, especially when the weather is between 70-80 degrees. Paddle boating is fun when the weather is chill. People watching can be fun, too. A lot of weirdos lol jk. Fun events from time to time, too.\\nPancakes are great here. The food is fresh, the staff is friendly, and the restaurant is kept clean. There is a wait to get in on the weekends so be prepared.\\nI like to visit pawnshops because of the potential for finding great items at a negotiable price that's a win-win.

I ended up ordering the club sandwich  since it comes with ham, turkey and bacon. I ordered it with fries. Place was pretty busy. I like that because the food must be good, right? Food was affordable.\\nTerrific service! We came here after my nephew's track meet because he lost a couple of his track shoe spikes. The employee was very kind and screwed brand new ones for only 75 cents!

Staff does a good job of keeping this place clean and organized. Cashiers are consistently efficient and friendly.\\nThis place is an authorized dealer but seem like a Verizon Wireless corporate store from their signage. Staff is friendly but charge for services that are free if you go to a corporate store so if you want to save money, go to a corporate store.\\nThe Las Vegas strip is without question a place for the entire family. There's a lot for children such as the Hershey's, M&M and Coca-Cola stores, as well as the amus\\nement park rides some of the Strip's casinos operate. Some of the hotels have amazing fire and water displays at night. For adults, the casinos of course are always fun. Aland some amazing restaurants sit within this area.\\nStaff is very friendly unlike their sister store down the street. I don't pawn things but like to come here to see what new items they have. Place is affordable and accommodating when it comes to negotiating. They have electronics like laptops, XBOXes, Playstations, IPads and other items like bicycles and jewelry.\\nI love coming to this Harkins. Pretty much all Harkins are great to visit. This particular location is surrounded by delicious restaurants. The staff delivers great service and ensures they keep the inside and outside of their theatre clean.\\nDecent food and decent prices. Employees work hard and are customer service oriented. Only reason I did not rate a 5 is because the food is not amazing. First timers should try the Mexican Flag enchiladas.\\nService could\\n be better but food is good. I like the location, too. The drive through line moves slower than other Jack In Box locations I have visited.\\nGood time spent. Not scary for me but there were screams from others. The second house on the right hand side is probably the best, in my opinion. The hayride isn't worth the admission as all you're doing is sitting on hay and monsters/zombies are jumping out of corn fields. Love that there's fair food available (turkey legs, hot dogs, fried Oreos, etc). There are zombies walking around and even a palm reader stand.\\nCame here for breakfast. I ordered a breakfast sandwich with sausage, egg and cheese and it was really good. I also had a slice of chocolate cake and it was also very good. The restaurant is clean, the staff is friendly, and the cook is fast.\\nCasino is very nice and atmosphere is great. Love when the performers sing because the other guests get wild. Find to people watch. Restaurants are decent and service is great.\\nLoved the Oreo panca\\nkes and strawberry shortcake French Toast! Freshly squeezed orange juice was also very tasty. Service is top notch and food comes out pretty quick even though this place can get extremely busy on Saturday/Sunday mornings. Great location in Scottsdale as well.\\nBeen a while since I reviewed this location. Been here a lot of times since my first review. Love this place! Staff is efficient and friendly, atmosphere is great and food is as good as it gets. Black Bear makes the best pancakes, cinnamon roll French Toast, onion rings, lava cake and bread pudding. Location is convenient, too.\\nAffordable, good location, decent brands and below average customer service. Store could also use some organizing and some shelves need to be restocked.

I tried the raspberry chocolate pancakes and they were on point. I ordered the sourdough banana pecan French toast. Crispy on the outside and soft on inside. It was melt in your mouth delicious. OJ and coffee were fresh and tasty.\\nI decided to give Sport Clips a try when I received an offer for a free haircut. I'm glad I took advantage of the offer because the stylist here are\\n so much more talented than those at a Great Clips. Stylists here are not only talented, they're friendly and efficient. The steamed towel is great and is free on your first visit. If you check in on Yelp, you'll get $5 off after your first visit.\\nImpressed overall. I didn't  think the food would be that good since this place is selling discounted prices on Groupon but I'm wrong. We started off with the big 5 appetizer which consists of mozzarella sticks, fried pickles, pretzel bites with cheese, nachos, and boneless wings. We substituted the boneless wings with mozzarella sticks so we got double mozzarella sticks. All items were tasty and well done. My girl ordered salmon with grilled veggies, fries and a side salad with honey mustard dressing and she liked them all. The salmon was well cooked and the fries needed a little extra salt but that's why there's salt shakers on the table. I ordered traditional wings with medium buffalo sauce. They were good but not the best wings in Surpris\\ne. Service was great. Our server Kristin did a great job as she was accommodating and checked in at the right times.\\nFriendly and fast service. There's an ATM at the drive through, near entrance and inside the store. Tellers are quick and there's also mortgage and investment specialists on site.\\nTasty, fast, friendly and clean. Flour tortillas are made fresh every day as are the meat options. They also give free samples if you're not sure what kind of meat you want. The burritos are not too big but they are satisfying. Limited seating inside and outside.\\nPlace is packed, nurses and doctors are busy and stressed, and billing employees seem like they don't understand billing. Hospital is clean but just like all other hospitals, you will wait for a long time and if you don't have insurance, you might need a loan to pay off the ridiculously high charges. My bill was high even with great insurance.\\nI ordered the crab cakes and grilled fish tacos and was satisfied. My girl ordered sushi and \\nshe also like was satisfied. Our waiter was helpful and friendly, and did a nice job overall. The restaurant looks great inside and out.\\nIn my opinion, the best resort in Las Vegas. The resort is huge. The indoor walkway is awesome as is the fact that there's like a mall in here with tons of high end stores. Casino is huge, all staff members I ran into were friendly. The pool area was five stars on it's own.\\nFriendly servers, accommodating cooks, clean and nice atmosphere, delicious food makes this a must visit restaurant. The pizza is made extremely well and tastes fresh. The lasagna is meaty, cheesy and delicious. The cookie with ice cream dessert is tasty as it's not hard but not too gooey.\\nGood spot in town. Deals are great and they have clothing for the entire family. They shoes are named brand and are affordable, too. Staff is friendly and they keep their store organized.\\nFresh, tasty and friendly service. The fresas con crema and ice cream flavors are tasty.

Location isn't bad either. The store is clean and the staff is accommodating. The only reason for me not rating with 5 stars is because the salad was soggy. I will come back though because of the melt in your mouth pizza, and awesome service.\\nDelicious donuts made fresh in front of your eyes. I ordered the Gorilla which is their chocolate flavor and it was warm, soft and melt in your mouth good. The location is convenient and only reason for the 4 stars is because the staff could be friendlier.\\nAmazing pizza! I think it's better than Fired Pie and Fired Pie is awesome. My fiancé also agrees and she loves Fired Pie. Restaurant is bigger than I thought - a lot of seats. The pizza was piping hot and delicious. I got salami, pepperoni, mild sausage and olives on my 6 inch pizza and it was delicious. Also, very affordable. A 6 inch is only $4.67. Only reason I didn't give a 5 is because \\nthe pizza maker could've been a little friendlier. She gave us the vibe that we were an inconvenience to her. She did a good job with making the pizza though. Cashier was good.\\nFast and decent customer service. Waffles are tasty and the other items are average. I like to add chocolate chips to my waffles. Small restaurant that is open 24/7.\\nThe average 2 star rating is right for this place. The original fries brought out were stale as was the side of Spanish rice with order of green chile steak enchiladas. The sauce on the enchiladas tasted like it came from a can. The waitress also forgot to bring my fries out and when she brought them out forgot about the side of ranch. My girl liked her grilled salmon with her sides.\\nDelicious healthy options at an affordable price. Yakisoba and teriyaki options are tasty as are the sushi options. Wife also recommends the miso soup.\\nDecent but not great. They could improve their enchilada sauce as it taste more generic than authentic. The breakfast \\nburritos are great. Try the chorizo breakfast burrito and add beans and cheese if you haven't had it. Good stuff.\\nBusy Veteran's Day with a lot of people going out for breakfast. My girl and I were seated right away by a friendly hostess. Our waitress was quick, friendly and accommodating. My girl got chocolate chip pancakes and they were awesome (I took a few bites). Black Bear Diner owns the recipe to the best pancake batter out there today. I ordered the bread pudding a la mode and it was warm, fluffy and delicious!\\nGreat waiter, average menu. There's lots of seating inside and out. We stopped by for breakfast. The breakfast buffet is $19. I ended up ordering the Cluck Omelette with cheddar, sausage and mushroom. It was good. The side of potatoes were my favorite part of breakfast.\\nDeals at Wal-Mart are always good. The only complaint I have is the lack of customer service and efficiency at the register. Training and supervision will improve the front lines at all Wal-Marts.\\nFast se\\nrvice and food is great. I like the wings here better than Buffalo Wild Wings. My favorite wing flavors are medium buffalo and BBQ. The plain and loaded tots are great! I recommend those as an appetizer.\\nGreat service and menu. Food was delicious. I ordered the pernil with rice and also tried the empanadas and mofongo (potato and plantains). All melt in your mouth good. The pernil was even better with hot sauce.\\nCame here for the first time and it was below average only because the pizza I ordered (by the slice) was definitely sitting for hours. I ordered the 2 slices of the their special edition which contains pepperoni, sausage, green peppers, onions and mushrooms. They added those toppings and fresh cheese to old slices. The pizza was exxxxtttrrraaa crispy when I got it because they reheated an old pizza. It tasted better than I thought so I'm going back and will order a whole pie just to taste a fresh pizza. Store is clean and staff is friendly.\\nGreat store to shop for the children\\n in your family. They have Legos for all ages and all kinds of different brands. Staff is helpful and friendly, and store organized.\\nStopped by on a slow Friday for lunch. I ordered fairly quickly but waited too long for my Philly Cheesecake sandwich. Besides the long wait, the Philly was tasty. Warm and toasted with melted provolone cheese.\\nMy go to grocery store because of the affordable prices and wide variety of products. Customer service could be better. Staff doesn't say hi most of the time and some have an unwelcoming body language.\\nHuge restaurant with a nice bar that has a lot of drink choices. Menu is expansive. Great choice of appetizers and desserts in addition to their lunch/dinner menu. My favorite burger is the Red Robin Royal as it's a 6 ounce patty topped with cheese, bacon, sunny side up egg, and their special sauce. It's awesome! The fried fish sandwich is one of my go tos as well. The French fries are tasty but I enjoy their onion rings more. Fried pickles as an app\", 'actual_label': 36, 'predicted_label': 36}, {'text': \"etizer is a good way to start your Red Robin experience and the mud pie is a good way to end it.

They were nice, efficient and did a great job of repeating orders for accuracy. The restaurant was also clean. As soon as my buddy showed up, we ordered our food at the counter. Our order consisted of three mini (8') pizzas: \\n\\n-One pineapple and cheese\\n-One sausage and mushroom \\n-One Barro's special \\n-A dozen medium buffalo wings (traditional) with extra sauce\\n-Three medium drinks\\n\\nEverything tasted great! If I'm around the area, I'll come back!\\nThe burritos are delicious because of the homemade goodness inside of them, however, they're significantly smaller and more expensive than other Mexican joints. The Red chili is amazing and always fresh. Service is top-notch, and the store is always clean.\\n\\nGreat deals on shoes, clothes and other sports gear. Huge selection, too. Customer service is also good.\\nFast and friendly service. Average McDonald in the sense that the food taste as it should. Good location.\\nAffordable, quick and tasty. The pizza slices are so huge that you get a pizza cutter with your dine in order. Pizza is piping hot, fresh and made to order. Employees are always friendly and accommodating.\\nBreakfast sandwiches are great. My favorite is the asiago cheese bagel breakfast sandwich. I add sausage to my sandwich. The brownies and cookies here are great, too. My favorite brownie is the cheesecake brownie. Salad station is great also as they allow you to build your own salad.\\nYogurt is delicious but the selection is small compared to other shops. I got Ghirardelli chocolate on one half and vanilla on the other half. Topped with Kit-Kat pieces, mini peanut butter cups, cheesecake pieces, cookie batter pieces, caramel and chocolate syrup, and two brownies.\\nExcellent cus\\ntomer service. We ordered at the counter and food was brought out to us. I got a mix plate with teriyaki chicken and Kalua pork. Plate came with steamed white rice and potato macaroni salad. All were melt in your mouth good. Wife got the breaded fish plate and it was also good. Breaded and cooked well done. Portions are good.\\nFood is always fresh, the staff's attentive, the place is always clean. The location is great, too. My favorite item here has to be from their breakfast menu. The Chilaqules with chorizo are very good. A little spicy but not too bad. Baked goods are great also.\\nOnly negative I have was waiting because I've been wanting to eat at a Hash Has A Go Go for years! There was a long list of people waiting but the wait was not long (15 minutes). I was surprised when I went inside how large the restaurant actually is. My girl and I shared our food. Here's what we got: Snickers pancake, vanilla waffle with a side of over easy eggs and seasoned potatoes. The Snickers pancake \\nwas awesome. It had A LOT of Snickers pieces baked in! The over easy eggs were well made and the potatoes were very good. The vanilla waffle was also really good. Would definitely go back!\\nDecent food, great vibe inside and out. The location is great just not fun trying to drive around here Friday and Saturday night. Staff is friendly and they're efficient.\\nAffordable, clean, friendly service and great products. Location is great because it's at the Chandler Fashion Center mall. Black Friday here is off the chart!\\nThis place is amazingly delicious! The pizza is made right in front of you and for unlimited toppings you pay the same price as someone who just gets cheese. The pizza comes out hot in like 5 minutes. If you check in on Yelp, they'll give you a free Pookie which is a warm cookie freshly baked topped with vanilla ice cream. Staff is very friendly and location is convenient.\\nGreat selection of delicious coffee. Wifi is free, secure and fast. The views are great when sitting out\\nside. In addition to coffee, they have great teas.\\nStaff is friendly and quick. They also do a good job of getting my food prepared as ordered each time. No complaints here and food tastes fresh for fast food standards.\\nDecent food, excellent prices and friendly service. Mexican food and wings should be skipped if you're looking for good food. Just stick to the pizza.\\nLove the cinnamon French Toast. It's melt in your mouth delicious! Morning can get very busy, especially on the weekend. Restaurant is clean, prices are reasonable and staff is accommodating and friendly.\\nMy fiancé loves this place! You can buy combo tickets to visit the Odysea Aquarium and this location for a cheaper fee than it would be to purchase admission to both places.

I don\\'t remember how my last experience went so I\\'m rating based on today\\'s. Clean and convenient location with outside seating. Misters were on for those who preferred to sit outside in the heat. Line to order moved quickly. Cashier was friendly and efficient. They provide free chips with their excellent red salsa. I ordered their carne asada fries. So much better than Los Favorito\\'s and Filiberto\\'s. The fries were thick, fresh, and tasted like they were cut in house. Their beans, carne asada and guac are also better than the two businesses mentioned previously. They have real silv\\nerware and bring your food out to you. Great place. Will definitely come back soon!\\nGreat service by the knowledgeable staff. The shifting range is classic! A lot of fun and there\\'s an employee in there to help those in need. Not only do they have a shooting range where you can use your own guns, but they have lessons for those that need to learn the basic fundamentals of shooting a gun. Those fundamentals are extremely important by the way. There\\'s public restrooms, water fountains, clothing, guns and ammo here. Kids are also allowed to shoot with adult supervision.\\nLine is long but that\\'s the norm here. The carne adobada fries are awesome and are the only reason why I come here. There is not dining area so come with a plan.\\nOne of the newer locations. Clean,  convenient location and an ok staff. Gas prices are good, too.\\nThis hotel is a beautiful! The buffet is also damn good and not too expensive. The staff treats its guests as they are the most important people and want to ensure t\\nheir guests know that they are there to assist with anything they can. Staying here is worth the price and the location is spot on.\\n30% off weekend but the service was not good. We were waiting to be assisted at the Watch jewelry section of the store. We asked an employee if she can help and she said she can\\'t because she only does sunglasses. Didn\\'t even call for help! Employees are also very pushy with the Macy\\'s credit card. No is no!\\nNice location and very clean. Staff was very friendly and efficient. I had a hard time deciding what I wanted so after much deliberation, I decided I was going to order the Matt Cain which comes with roast beef, turkey, salami, godfather sauce and provolone. It was tasty. I could\\'ve gone without the the Godfather sauce though. Bread was great.\\n\\nIf you check-in you get a free bag of Zapp\\'s chips. The Hotter n\\' Hot Jalapeño flavor is very good.

Staff at the front desk, photo and pharmacy are attentive and friendly.

The stuffed French toast, brownies and corned beef hash skillet are my favorite items.\\nCame here for a work gathering. We booked here since they had a conference room. Service was good. Refills kept coming and food came out a decent time considering there were 18 of us. Dining room looked updated and clean. Checkout cashier could be a little quicker and friendlier.\\nGreat spot with many businesses inside. The Firm Barber is where I get my haircut. Great cuts for men while the women get their hair done with a different business. Place is clean and is in a great spot o\\nf town.\\nOk service and food. Happy hour is Monday-Friday from 2pm-6pm and the deals are good, but other places sell tastier tacos for less i.e. Los Taquitos. Waiter was very slow and forgot my drink a couple of times. Starter chips and salsa are free and tasty. Mexican corn was good as were the nachos. Carne asada and crispy fish tacos were average. Patio seating is pet friendly.\\nIce cream is made in house per the cashier. Good amount of ice cream flavors but I wasn\\'t too impressed. I tried the butter pecan and Superman.\\nBelow average compared to other ice cream shops. Also felt like we were bothering the young cashier with our order. He definitely did not want to be there that day.\\nPizza is delicious! Without question the best \"New York\" style pizza joint in AZ, IMO. They accommodate orders, especially if you want one half different than the other. Cheesecake desserts are awesome. Oreo cheesecake is my favorite.

My preference is the chocolate chip only because I love chocolate. The Italian omelet with pepperoni, sausage, mushroom, marinara and mozzarella is delicious, too. It's like eating a pizza with no bread. I also love the sweet potato fries here. Staff is friendly, courteous and efficient.\\nGreat location, clean restaurant, and friendly staff that are efficient, caring and accommodating. Stuffed, deep and thin crust pizzas are A Plus! Wings, fries, sandwiches, pasta and Pizza Cookie dessert are also delicious! Sigh up to their rewards club to get special offers and to earn a free pizza cookie for your birthday!\\nHorrible service today. Walked in and we had to seat ourselves in the bar area\\n. Looked like there was only one waiter and he was manning the bar and dining room! He was busy and took a long time to get to us. When he finally did, he took our drinks then came back like 15 minutes later to take our food order. Food came out late! Even forgot my ranch and when I advised it took him like 5 minutes to come out with it. Slow with the refills, too. Poor guy was probably carrying the load of another waiter that called in sick. I noticed a manager (pretty sure a manager) sitting in booth and didn't even help the poor guy. I always liked coming here but today's visit was extremely disappointing.\\nStupendously friendly and accommodating staff. We asked if they can turn on the live presidential debate on one of their many flat screen HD TVs and they didn't hesitate. The chicken wings were fresh and crispy, and blended well with the medium Buffalo and honey BBQ sauces. The tater tots and shoestring fries were also fresh, crispy and delicious. We will come back!\\nExcellent serv\\nice by RJ! Come and ask for him by name for the best deals and service. Store is clean and products are top notch! My family and I are very happy!\\nGreat store filled with nice items for the home. Prices are affordable, staff is friendly, and hey have a nice selection of clearance items. They also have snacks likes chocolate and chips.\\nGreat service. Waitress, Kimberly, seated us and took our drink order right away. She let us choose where to sit and was friendly the entire time. Also, very efficient and checked in at the right times. Menu is expansive with great choices. The mozzarella sticks were tasty and came with meat sauce so make sure to say no meat in the marinara if you can't have it. I personally like meat sauce. We also ordered fries for $1.99 extra with the appetizer (mozzarella sticks) and they gave us a lot of fries! Fries were tasty, too. We also ordered the gyro sandwich with onion rings. Onion rings are delicious! Top 3 I've tasted. The gyro meat was really good with cr\\nispy edges and the pita bread was also tasty and butter toasted. We will definitely come back. Service from Kimberly=5 and food from cooks=5.\\nGreat prices, huge store, convenient location, and friendly service. They have every genre of movies and music, hits or not. Store is organized so that you can easily locate what you are looking for.\\nIncreasing my rating to 3 stars from 1 because of today's service. Waiter was really good today. Only reason I didn't mark with a 5 is because the first batch of wings that came out were cold and stale. Manager came around and I let her know. She got me a fresh batch that was delicious. My favorite flavors are medium buffalo and honey BBQ. Tater tots and potato skins are my favorite appetizers. \\n\\nOn Tuesday's, wings are 69 cents with a beverage purchase. They also have a rewards program. Spend $100 cumulatively and get a $10 dollar credit.\\nGreat food at a great price. I only come here for the lunch specials.

They were very excited as was I to try to this Yelp gem.  We ordered two chicken Parmigiana sandwiches, one eggplant sandwich, one Kurt's chicken burger, one pastrami sandwich, three chocolate cannolis and two regular cannolis. They gave me two free regular cannolis since I ordered a veal parmigiana sandwich and they were out. Yep, so we had a total of 7 cannolis! Very nice of them.

The pizza was piping hot with fresh ingredients. The salad was unlike other pizza shops in that it had fresh veggies and cheese and a spring mix, not just romaine lettuce. Another cool thing about this place is a window that lets you see the cooks make the pizza.\\nFast, affordable and delicious!

Fiancée's mom was happy with her smoked salmon Benedict. I enjoyed my Brie and bacon omelette (egg whites). Roasted potatoes were tasty. My favorite was the pineapple upside down muffin.

The taco maker looked miserable and did not like that I ordered 3 grilled fish tacos and 2 meat tacos because the minimum order for fish tacos is five, but their menu didn't specify this rule.

They have the best Orange Chicken and Orange Beef in town and in my opinion the world. I have eaten in Los Angeles's China town and China Town's restaurants can't compete. When I order the Orange Chicken I substitute the white rice underneath for noodles. Its like having Orange Chicken on top of chow mien just with no vegetables. I'm sure they will add veggies if you request them. When I order their Orange Beef which is basically the same thing as Orange Chicken except its with beef, duh. A previous reviewer stated that the Orange Beef is enough the earn this place a 5 and he is 100% correct, it is amazing. The beef is breaded and is deliciously tender.

The owners are friendly are as well.\\nFood is always made to order and tastes amazing and fresh. Staff is courteous and friendly, too. Long lines at lunch time and since food is literally made when it\\'s ordered, it takes longer than most fast food joints.\\nI\\'ve been coming here for years. I\\'ve purchased 3 new cars here and continually come in for maintenance. Yvette is my service advisor and always goes above and beyond. An example: Yesterday, my battery died. I called Yvette to confirm it was covered under warranty. It was and she asked that I come in ASAP so the battery can be replaced. She didn\\'t give me the textbook answer of setting \\nan appointment, she wanted my car working right away. Always friendly and has a smile on her face.\\nAlways had a great time coming here. Lowell Huggins, the former vice mayor of Chandler who is no longer with us owned this spot and always provided great service and haircuts. Classic location near downtown Chandler.\\nGreat location and clean store with a great beer service. Prices are not the lowest for gas but you\\'re getting the best in Chevron.\\nFast, friendly, accommodating and great tasting food. Server provides free chips and salsa. Both the green and red salsas are tasty. The chilaquiles with eggs are tasty fresh. They\\'re crunchy and the sauce goes great with them.\\nGreat neighborhood and eateries shop nearby. All of the newest movies are shown here. Coke products, candy, popcorn, hot dogs, etc sold here. There\\'s also a bar by the main entrance. Seats are comfortable but not like AMC\\'s leather recliners.\\nI\\'ve been coming here for years for sales and service. I\\'ve purchased 3 brand new\\n vehicles here since 2011. This past Tuesday, I showed up for a prescheduled appointment (days in advance) and this is the conversation with the service advisor (not my usual advisor):\\n\\n*Advisor: \"Are you going to stay or wait?\"\\n\\n*Me: \"Wait\"\\n\\n*Advisor: (Shocked facial Expression) \"Mechanic is backed up right now and it\\'s going to be while. Can you reschedule?\"\\n\\n*Me: (thinking UGH!) \"Sure.\"\\n\\n*Advisor: \"Can you come back tomorrow at 7am?\"\\n\\n*Me: \"No, I go into work at 7am.\"\\n\\n*Advisor: \"Hold on (goes in and comes back out in like 3 minutes). Mechanic said he will fit you in today.\"\\n\\n*Me: \"I also would like for someone to look at my tire. Something is wrong with it because I have to keep filling it with air every other day. Last time, you guys couldn\\'t find the issue.\"\\n\\n*Advisor: \" don\\'t know if he will be able to look at that.\" \\n\\nThat\\'s when I made my mind up that I won\\'t come back here. I had an appointment scheduled days in advance and they couldn\\'t even call to tell me they were busy an\\nd offer to reschedule. They have in the past. I don\\'t think my original advisor is there anymore. Sucks if that\\'s the case cause she rocked. Also, I wanted to pay for my tire to be looked into and fixed and they didn\\'t even bother. Now, I\\'m going to another business that will be more than happy to do business with me.\\nFriend and I stopped at the bar. Great options and excellent service. Best drink option is the margarita mixed with the \"3 way.\"\\nLocation and the wide array of products make this place must visit. The mini-theatre showing a mini M&M movie about being Lost in Vegas was also entertaining. This place is huge and the location is awesome. 4 stories of great products.\\nLove downtown Phoenix! Great restaurants like Cibo, Matt\\'s breakfast and Pizzeria Bianco. Parks are great as are the mainstream events held at the arena and other theaters. First Fridays are free and are held, yep, the first Friday of every month. Parking is expensive depending we\\'re you park. I think it\\'s funny h\\now one garage charges $20 but less than a 2 minute drive there\\'s a parking lot charging $5.\\nTasty, convenient location, and open all hours of the day, everyday. Is doesn\\'t get any better than that. The line moves quickly and the food is awesome.\\nSome staff members do not seem happy. I\\'ve traveled quite a bit with American and there\\'s always that one staff member that ruins the traveling experience for me. I always provide feedback though because poor customer service, especially in the airline industry is not acceptable.\\nGreat clothing and other products for the outdoors. Brands here are top notch. They have a fudge stand where they make fresh fudge. It\\'s delicious. Free pictures with Santa from November until Christmas Eve. Pretty cool that they don\\'t charge. Great service by the staff.\\nI love Tokyo House! Service is great and food is has been consistently delicious. The ownership change made no difference in food or service provided. Must gets here are: Orange Chicken, Orange Beef, S', 'actual_label': 36, 'predicted_label': 36}, {'text': 'I probably wouldn\\'t come back after an experience like this I know that this is really a great place and I did have fun with the people that I was with so I won\\'t let this one incident be the precedent set. All of the other staff we encountered during our visit were quite friendly and helpful, we just happened to get one bad apple.\\nI guess this place goes under the bland section on my list.  The ingredients are fresh, but there\\'s nothing out of the ordinary.  I had the steak burrito and I think they literally just cook a steak, chop it up, and put it in your burrito.  There\\'s nothing Mexican about it, no spice, no sauce, just plain old steak.\\n\\nI\\'m still not a fan of the grilled burritos but this was the best one I\\'ve had of the grilled variety.  What I REALLY wasn\\'t a fan of was waiting 15 minutes after I had placed my order.  I don\\'t mind waiting in a line to place my order, but once it\\'s placed I should have my food quickly.  They had both stations going but not both grills so they w\\nere just creating a backlog for themselves.  Get with it and buy some panini grills and get people on their way.\\n\\nThe bonus for these buys is their price point.  A burrito and a bottle of water for just over $8 is a great deal!\\n\\nOverall this burrito was something I could make at home.  There was no special spice blend, the salsa was out of a can, and the other toppings were just basic veggies.\\n\\nNext please!\\nThis is a super fun place to take your kids and get some child-like enjoyment for yourself.\\n\\nThe only negative here for me was the check-in process. It was a little confusing despite the large signs they have up in the entry and the staff were a little less than helpful.\\n\\nOnce we were in though my wife and I had a blast with our nice and nephew. We also realized very quickly just how out of shape we were. The place is laid out in various sections. In one corner is an area for the really little ones where they can jump around while being heavily supervised. Behind that is a couple of\\n dodge-ball courts where they have trampolines at an angle along the back to give you some extra power for an attack or easy escape.\\n\\nIn the central area there\\'s various trampolines just for general bouncing enjoyment. In a caged off area to the side is an obstacle course. This is where you really figure out that you\\'re a flabby sack of potatoes. There\\'s an area that\\'s sectioned off for private parties, so if your office is looking for something to do or your kid is having a birthday you can reserve this space. Beside that is a couple of tightropes with foam pits underneath and beside that are similar pits with rope swings.\\n\\nAt the far end are a couple of basketball hoops you you can give the awesome dunking skills of your dreams a try (see: flabby sack of potatoes, above). In addition to the play area they also have a small arcade and a concession. There\\'s lockers near the front to lock up your shoes and other belongings and if you don\\'t have a pair already, you have to buy their spec\\nial socks. They\\'re normal socks with rubber grip on the bottom.\\n\\nAlso to set your mind at ease, there\\'s staff everywhere to make sure all the kids are following the rules and being safe.\\n\"Meh\" is the best word to describe this location. It\\'s fine, there\\'s nothing really wrong with it, but nothing really great either. It\\'s clean, there\\'s a handful of tables to sit at, the staff aren\\'t completely terrible, and the food will live up to your expectations.\\nThis is a busy location. For the large chunk of land they have here I\\'m surprised they didn\\'t put in way more pumps when they renovated this station a handful of years go. Maybe there\\'s some red tape that prevented them from this.\\n\\nDespite the number of people coming through here I\\'ve never had much of a wait inside when buying something from the convenience store. The only real issue sometimes is getting an open pump. If you have to drive around the pumps to get on the other side of your car, that open pump might be snagged by someone dr\\niving into the station.\\nThis is the only location downtown with a pool and is the only reason I come to this location. The pool is 18 metres long which is shorter than the standard of 25m. While it would be nicer to have a larger pool, I can\\'t really complain since its included in my membership.\\n\\nThe pool is closed right now for annual maintenance so hopefully things can only get better.\\n**2.5 stars overall**\\n\\nThere are somethings about this place that are worthy of three stars and some things that are worth only two. Hence the 2.5 star rating.\\n\\nUnder the three star category I would list the service and the hours. Our waitress was friendly and quick. We must have been the first customers of the day because she had to put on a fresh pot of coffee for my wife. The weekend hours are good as they open at 10am for brunch. The prices are fair also. The brunch menu will run you $7-9 for a meal.\\n\\nUnfortunately the things that I weigh a little more heavily on a place like this fall under the tw', 'actual_label': 37, 'predicted_label': 37}, {'text': \"o star category. First off, the food. I would put the food slightly below average. I had the eggs benedict which parts of were ok and parts were not. The eggs were cooked well but the back bacon was super chewy and hard to cut through. The home fries consisted of greasy pan fried potatoes mixed with peppers and onions. Normally I would be all over greasy home fries but these were not the good kind of greasy.\\n\\nThis place used to be the Groundhog Pub, and it essentially it still is. The new owners have done nothing to the decor. It's still the same worn out booths and woodgrain walls. \\n\\nI probably wouldn't come back to this place for brunch again but I would be willing to check it out at night as a neighbourhood pub. Particularly on the weekends when they have karaoke.\\nVery friendly staff and faster than usual service. \\n\\nNow if only Aspen Landing wasn't such a pain to find parking in.\\nThese guys gave me a little shock and awe, but not in a way to give them 5 stars.  \\n\\nShock: The bamburge\\nr is only $7.95 for a 1/3 lb hunk of meat\\nAwe: It only comes with lettuce, onion, and tomato\\n\\nShock: It costs $1.25 for some garlic mayo\\nAwe: They give you almost a quarter cup of the stuff\\n\\nShock: The onion rings are $4.25\\nAwe: They give you a paper bag full of them, enough to feed a small army.\\n\\nThe burger was juicy and the toppings made for an excellent experience but the costs quickly added up:\\n\\n$1.25 for garlic mayo\\n$1.75 for cheese\\n$1.75 for sauteed onions\\n$7.95 for the bamburger\\n$4.25 for onion rings\\n\\nThe onion rings were nothing special.  They seemed to be just regular old frozen rings.  The decor is really nice with leather wrapped chairs and booths, carpeted flooring, and wood and brick walls.  The staff were friendly and quick with their service.  Overall a good experience.\\nThe food here is really good. Like, 4 stars good.\\n\\nUnfortunately the slow service is keeping my review at a solid three stars. I came during the dinner rush and found the line to be about 5 people deep. I\\n figured the line would move quickly as they had 5+ staff working in this small location. In reality the serving process was tedious as they only had one person serving customers.\\n\\nBy the time I got through the line it had grown to 8-10 people long and no one behind the counter seemed to care or offer to give the poor woman serving up dishes a hand.\\nThe old Drum & Monkey is now Leopold's Tavern. I was invited to the friend's & family opening on Friday night after the Flames game and arrived to a pretty packed place. The party had been going on since at least 6:00. There was free drinks for all and a bunch of staff to keep things moving nice and quick.\\n\\nTalking to some of the people I was with, they told me that there's a few Leopold's in Saskatchewan with the name of the bar being the street name that the original tavern is located on.\\n\\nThe decor is eclectic. They've covered the walls with cork and there's all sorts of random things stapled to them. Old hockey cards, license plates, fl\\nyers and posters from other bygone bars in the area, photos, you name it. There's still some space on the walls for more to come. At the bar they have approximately 10-12 taps flowing with local craft beer. Tool Shed, Banded Peak, Annex, Village, and more were all being served.\\nThis is a great no-nonsense convenience store. They have everything you would expect.  The store was clean and organized and the staff member that rang up my order was more cheerful than most convenience store clerks you encounter.\\nI like this location as it is never overly busy. Even with the movie theatre right next door, where you'd think people would come in to kill time before their movie starts, the line at the cash in never very long.\\n\\nI find some of the aisles in the back corner of the store a little tight to navigate when the store is busier but that's my only complaint. There always seems to be a staff member around when you need one or just milling about ready to greet you when you walk by.\\nFrom the t\\nime is stepped into this palace things were not good. The restaurant was moderately busy but it took an abnormally long time to be shown to a seat. Where was the hostess at the door? Oh there isn't one, you just wait until a server isn't too busy with his/her section to seat you.\\n\\nOnce seated, I had enough time to browse the ridiculously large menu, figure out what I wanted, text a few people, and answer an email or two before the server even came over to see if I wanted anything to drink. For some reason my table was the only one off on its own form the rest of the servers section, though there was another server at the tables right beside mine who completely ignored me when I tried to get her attention.\\n\\nThe one good thing about my visit here was that once I had placed my order, the food came rather quickly. I ordered the heurvos rancheros. What I received was a hot mess on a tortilla with a side of home fries. Under a disgustingly huge pile of cheese was a heap of something like sal\", 'actual_label': 37, 'predicted_label': 37}, {'text': 'sa, and two eggs buried somewhere in there. There was a large amount of sour cream on the side also to drown whatever this was in. Other reviewers rave about the home fries. Why? They weren\\'t good. They were ok, but not something I would be telling all my friends about. It seems to me that they\\'re a bag of frozen processed things fried and/or baked.\\n\\nFrankly, I would try this place again and would try something else, but the service was just so terrible. I don\\'t think its the fault of the servers, they were busting their asses. It seems like the restaurant is run very lean. There was no hostess and no busser. Those tasks were left up to the servers which were already at their capacity seeing to their full sections.\\nI needed a couple of extra lengths of racking for a table and to make some shelves for my work van. This was the place I was told to come to. Checking online, they did indeed have what I was looking for.\\n\\nThese guys have a small showroom/office area with many of the differen\\nt types of racking, shelving, and accessories they carry. In the warehouse area they have what seems to be the most popular items stocked. If you\\'re looking for larger racking I\\'m guessing you have to order it in unless they maybe have a yard out back where its stored.\\n\\nThe staff were friendly and helpful. They even offered to cut the lengths of supports I was purchasing to the size I needed, saving my lots of time playing with my hacksaw later that day.\\nThe people that run this place are very nice though sometimes there is a language barrier.  The post office is almost always busy.  There isn\\'t much else in the store worth looking at unless you\\'re a smoker as they seem to have a large selection of cigarettes.  Everything else you might need can be found at the Rexall down the hall and for cheaper.\\nDecently fast and friendly service. \\n\\nThe whole plaza is getting a face lift right now so the parking lot can be a little challenging to navigate with the various construction vehicles scatt\\nered around.\\nPancho, Pancho, you\\'re the man. You make a churro like no one can!\\n\\nFresh churros filled with the topping of your choice; as long as your choice is chocolate, strawberry, or caramel. Aside from churros, they have a range of baked goods. They don\\'t have a menu or labels on said baked goods so you\\'ll have to ask what some of them are if you\\'re not familiar with the items displayed. They also do some hot drinks to go with your tasty carb-tastic dessert.\\nIt had probably been a decade since my first visit to Jubilations. My wife and I got some tickets from a friend who couldn\\'t go and we saw the Star Wars show.\\n\\nThe show was great. It was funny, a small amount of interaction from the crowd, and well executed for the size of the room. The food was only ok though. I get that they have to make everything for everyone at the same time and try to feed everyone at the same time, between breaks in the show, but my prime rib was a little on the cool side, despite being served on a warm\\n plate. It was also disappointing to see that they serve the prime rib medium instead of medium-rare like most restaurants. The drinks were delicious though and the pony jug went down fast.\\n\\nGreat job to the cast and crew for a fun show and great service.\\nThis location moved down the mall from their central location to where Sport Check used to be along with the old food court. I find the layout of this store to be congested. The lines at the cash collide with people trying to navigate between the aisles constantly. By my perception, they have less floor space now but they\\'re still trying to squeeze in the same amount of product.\\n\\nNotably, this location does not carry lottery tickets. They have the trays in their counter but they\\'re empty.\\nThis is a pretty good food court burrito place. The ingredients are fresh and everything tastes like it is supposed to. As with most Canadian restaurants, the hot salsa is only hot enough to wake up your tongue from an afternoon nap and not a coma li\\nke it should.\\n\\nNow normally I don\\'t give a place more than 3 stars if they grill the burrito just based on the fact that this is burrito blasphemy. However, at Freshwest they only lightly grill them so the lettuce stays crisp and the sourcream cool. Not like the other so-called burrito place that grill them to a crisp.\\n\\nThe prices here are on par with their competition. A steak burrito with a bottle of Coke was an even $11.\\n\\nAll-in-all a good experience. Definitely the best choice in this food court.\\nCool 50\\'s style diner breakfast and lunch place. Red and white sparkly vinyl booths, Elvis and Marylin Monroe decor, and old magazine ads spread throughout.\\n\\nTheir menu has traditional options like omelettes, waffles, and the \"benny breakfast\" which consists of eggs, toast, bacon, and sausage. Then they have some non traditional items too like The ESB which has mini pirogies sausage and eggs. They also have lunch items. Breakfast will run you around $15 per meal plus drinks.\\n\\nWhat I like a', 'actual_label': 37, 'predicted_label': 37}, {'text': 'bout places like these is that I can get a no nonsense breakfast. While places like OEB and Monki are great, sometimes you just want some bacon and eggs and toast. You get in, eat, and get out without a fuss.\\n\\nThese guys are locally owned too which is great to support a small business. It also means that they\\'re getting many things locally like the Spoumbo\\'s sausage they serve.\\n\\nSo far so good. Keep up the great work!\\nMy wife and I only pop in here occasionally when coming from Spruce Meadows as its not really close to us for any other reason. \\n\\nThey have a solid nacho platter and yesterday I gave the short rib mac and cheese a try. Also delicious. The service is always good, but we\\'re also coming in on a Sunday afternoon for lunch when its slower.\\n\\nNo complaints here, just a good neighbourhood pub.\\nThis location has been reno\\'d so it\\'s now the McCafe concept. Other than that it\\'s still the hub of drunken post-bar debauchery that it always has been.\\n\\nOne night as I was stumbling home I\\n stopped in to get a Big Mac combo. When I received my order I found that they had decided for that I wanted it upsized and had charged me for it with out asking. Because I was a good deal into the bottle I decided to keep my mouth shut instead of making a scene and ending up in the drunk tank.\\n\\nMy trip here last week revealed that the staff don\\'t have patience. They call out your order when they bring it up to the counter. Before you even have a chance to make eye contact with the person holding the bag (pun intended), they\\'re calling a second time.\\n\\n\\nOh and to answer your question Vivek, a McDouble is a bun filled with regret and remorse.\\n\\nNov. 30-day challenge 18/30.\\nUnfortunately, this is where shopping malls go to die. Hopefully things will change now with Zellers clearing out their stock and making way for Target to open early next year.\\n\\nOutside of Zellers, Price Chopper, Rexall, and the LCBO there isn\\'t really much here. There\\'s a Royal Le Page which I can never tell if it\\'s su\\npposed to be a storefront where you can meet with a realtor or just advertising for places for sale. Either way, they\\'re not doing a good job. \\n\\nThere\\'s a handful of other independent stores that cover the electronics, clothing,  and dollar categories among a few others.\\nReally knowledgeable staff and ready to help. They won\\'t steer you down the wrong path just to make a few extra bucks, they\\'ll set you up with what you need and nothing more. No sales pressure.\\n\\nI find them to be a little higher priced than what I would like but over-all they provide good value for the quality products they sell.\\nThis place was pretty brutal. The fish itself was good but everything else was just plain bad. I placed a large order to take back to my hotel for my coworkers and I to enjoy while we worked on finishing a presentation. When I got back to the hotel I found the edemame frozen (and already peeled), the tempura had obviously been refridgerated and was cold, and the rice under the sushi fell apart\\n when you tried to pick up a piece.\\n\\nThe saving grace from this being a one star review were the staff.  They were very accomodating and did their best to put the large order together in a timely fashion.\\nPopped in yesterday for a quick lunch and sat at the bar.\\n\\nThere seemed to be some sort of tour going on when I arrived so it was a little confusing walking in the door and having a group of people standing there with beers in their hands. The bartender quickly came over and asked if I needed a seat.\\n\\nThey have a $16 \"choose your own adventure\" style lunch menu as well as their standard menu. As enticing as all the options were on the lunch menu I chose to go with their arugula salad and added a flatiron steak. \\n\\nThe salad was large in terms of how salads go. This is on purpose though as the menu items here are designed to be shared. The salad was tasty and light and hit the spot. The bartender didn\\'t ask how I wanted my steak done so I\\'m not sure if there\\'s an option. The steak was c\\nooked to medium rare which is just the way I would have asked anyway.\\n\\nThe only miss here for me was that they only had 4 draught beer selections from their normal offering. I went with a Village Wit, which is always a good option for me, but I had wanted the Phillips White Peach Ale to pair with my salad.\\nI had my second experience here last night.  This time was just take out but the experience was just as good.  The chicken roti was super yummy, though not as saucy as the last time.  What more is there to say when everyone else has said it already?  Good food, no frills, great price.\\nI find this store to be a little cramped. It seems that the aisles are narrower than usual and the lighting is dim. While I like that the lighting makes the store feel less like a doctor\\'s office, in this case I think it just makes me feel more closed in. I\\'ve never seen any staff other than the one working at the cash register. The only reason I keep coming here is because of the post office which make', 'actual_label': 37, 'predicted_label': 37}, {'text': 's it easy to grab something I need. If I\\'m not here for the post office then I\\'d rather stop at the Shoppers a block away.\\nI generally avoid this location because it\\'s crazy in the summer with their rooftop patio, even though its within walking distance from my house. Usually I opt for the 52nd Street location which seems to only be busy with the after work happy hour crowd.\\n\\nSome friends suggested coming here for dinner last night and reserved a table. Our server was really on top of things as we didn\\'t even have our jackets off when she came by to greet us. As usual, the beer was great and they had a few seasonal options available which included their delicious Octoberfest. Bombers of Octoberfest were also on special so I nabbed a bunch of those for $5 each.\\n\\nFor dinner I gave the buffalo chicken wrap a try with the house salad. Both were great. I appreciate that the house salad was more than just some shitty lettuce with some carrots and a tomato wedge on it. My wife got the chicken\\n burger which I also gave a try and was decent.\\nThis place is wall-to-wall shoes, and their even all over the floor. The sign on the building says that they specialize in wide feet. This is great for people like me where it is impossible to find shoes.\\n\\nThe prices however prevent me from shopping here often. You can expect to pay over $200 for a pair of shoes, and they aren\\'t necessarily the most fashionable. \\n\\nI would recommend checking this place out if you have wide feet but it may be very hit and miss for you if you don\\'t quite have the budget.\\nI\\'ve always had a good time here. There is a number of tables and machines, good amenities, and everything is well maintained. There\\'s enough entertainment here to keep everyone busy even if you\\'re not interested in gambling. \\n\\nThe down side here is that with Cowboys nightclub apart of this building, the crowd can be young and obnoxious. Also, due to its proximity to the Saddledome, it can get quite crowded here before or after an event. Tho\\nugh, with the casino being close to the Dome, you can conveniently make a stop here as part of your plans for the evening like having a place to grab dinner before a Flames game or to have drinks after.\\nAll hail the fish taco!\\n\\nOutside of La Jolla (San Diego), CA this was the best plate of fish tacos I\\'ve had.\\n\\nThey just opened on July 11th but after a week and a half they seem to have things together. I didn\\'t experience any of those new restaurant growing pains that you normally see within the first few weeks of opening. Everything was top notch.\\n\\nUpon entering I was greeted by Amy, one of the owners, who gave me a very enthusiastic \"Welcome to Combine\". Because I was alone she asked if I would like to sit at the bar, which I did. Albert, the other owner, was behind the bar and quickly got me a pint of Big Wheel. \\n\\nTheir menu is southwest inspired with salads, burritos, burgers, tacos, and many more things to choose from. Each entree will run you approximately $12 to $20, but average\\n at $14 or $15.\\n\\nI went with the fish tacos (grilled not fried). Yes, I know what you\\'re saying; \"Chris opted for tacos over a burrito?\". True story. That\\'s because these guys do a So Cal style fish taco and I have yet to find anything like it in Toronto. Though there are two places in San Diego where I\\'ve had better fish tacos, I would come here in a second because they\\'re such a close second place to the other two.\\n\\nThe server asked if I wanted hot sauce (ofcourse I did). I was pleasantly surprised when she brought out 4 different options and they were actually real hot sauces (not that Frank\\'s redhot crap). Further to my hot sauce enjoyment was when Amy came by with a fifth option, saying it was her favourite. It WAS the best option.\\n\\nCombine is clearly benefitting from the press and word of mouth they\\'re getting. By 7:00 on a Friday night the place was full and they were having couples wait at the bar.\\n\\nAfter my meal, while I was enjoying a pint of 416, Amy stopped by to see how ev\\nerything was. We chatted about how I was just in and going back to So Cal and enjoy the fish tacos there and that hers were fantastic. She explained that she worked at a restaurant in OB (Ocean Beach for you non-So Cal travelers) for two weeks to learn how to make a good fish taco.\\n\\nFor the fish tacos and two pints my bill was just over $32. Great value for the quality and service you receive here.\\n\\nCan\\'t wait to go back!\\nI have mixed experiences with this store over the years. The biggest thing is the staff. If you find the right person they will be excellent, but unfortunately most of the staff are less than average. My most recent experiences are this exactly.\\n\\nI came in before Christmas looking for skates for my fiancee. I knew going in that she didn\\'t want hockey skates and preferred figure skates, but when I got to the wall of skates they had a third kind which looked like a blend of a hockey skate and a figure skate. Someone came over to see if I needed some help and I indeed ha', 'actual_label': 37, 'predicted_label': 37}, {'text': \"d a few questions. The problem though was that I knew just as much about skates as he did. Let the fun ensue.\\n\\nHe told me that this third kind of skate was a recreational skate. This sounded like the one to go with so I then asked him what the difference was between the three models they had. They were $10 different in price and he said that colour was the reason in a very non-confident voice. \\n\\nI decided on a skate and told him my fiancees shoe size. I knew that you're supposed to go down a size or two when buying skates but couldn't remember exactly which. The sales guy tried to tell me that you go with the same as your shoe size or maybe one smaller. I tried to help the guy out by suggesting that he ask one of the hockey employees or someone that might have a little more knowledge. He was having none of that.\\n\\nHe then proceeded to pull out the foot sizing devices holding two of them side-by-side and eyeballing which size I would need. Seriously?! He also said a couple of times durin\\ng the whole process that it would be much easier if my fiancee was just here to try on the skates herself. Really buddy?! You're working during the Christmas season. I'm buying a gift! \\n\\nI ended up just choosing the size I thought would be the correct one and sternly asked him to double-check with someone else when he went to fetch the skates. \\n\\nLuckily I was right and the skates fit perfectly.\\n\\nWhen I came back to the store after Christmas to get them sharpened it was a completely different story. The guy working at the sharpening desk was great. He was friendly and helpful. He quickly took the skates off our hands and gave us a claim cheque to come back when we were done our shopping to pick them up. When we returned he was just as polite and quickly sent us on our way.\\nThis location is my regular book store as it is close to my house. It is not quite as large as most but it still has the selection you need. from time to time they hold various events here. Most recently when they wer\\ne launching the e-reader they had a private event to tell people all about the new product.\\n\\nThe staff can be a little sparse at times, but when you do hunt one down they are very knowledgeable and friendly. The cashiers are always quick to get everyone through. No matter how long the line is you won't have to wait very long.\\nCame through here during TIFF. Despite the huge numbers of people they had tons of staff making beverages and getting everyone through the line quickly. My London fog was up to normal Starbucks quality and was done way quicker than I normally experience at my regular locale.\\n\\nNov. 30-day challenge 33/30\\nI was shocked when I looked at the menu and found the prices to be quite reasonable.  I mean this place is in Yorkville right?  An entree will run you a mere $12 to $18.\\n\\nI had a beer and shared the Bresezze (sp?) pizza with my wife.  The pizzas are a great size to share (which makes this place even cheaper) or to eat yourself and have a couple of pieces for lunch \\nthe next day.\\n\\nThe food is really authentic and so are the staff.  I don't think one of them wasn't Italian.  The staff were really on the ball, taking away plates immediately and bringing more bread promptly when we ran out.  One of the girls we were with liked the staff so much she got the waiter's phone number.\\nThis place is Starbucks meets local tea shop meets Booster Juice.  You can buy loose tea and all the paraphernalia to go along with it or just grab a tea latte to go with an herbal supplement to boost whatever is making you feel down.  \\n\\nBeing at Don Mills means you're paying a premium for this service of course.  The latte's, iced teas, and other drinks will run you no less than $4 and you could get as high as $7 or $8.  Worth the money in my opinion since these guy know how to brew a great cup of tea.\\n\\nThere is some seating inside for a cold winter day but there is ample seating outside being that the store is located beside the malls green space.\\n\\nBecause of the premium pr\\nice I wouldn't make this my go to place, but if you're shopping at Don Mills then Teaopia is definitely the place to stop at for a cup of hot love.\\nI have to agree with the previous reviewer that the car wash here is terrible. After my van dried there was hard water/soap marks on the windshield because my vehicle wasn't properly rinsed. \\n\\nI've never gone inside, only paid at the pump. For that this location is fine, other than that its located on a very busy corner so It can take a while to leave.\\nCame here for the Jennifer K. CMYE.\\n\\nThe food was really good. All of the appetizers were delicious. I wish I had had time to order a meal.\\n\\nThe wine selection is solid. I'm not a wine snob by any means but I thought they have a good selection for both price and flavours/types. For $7+ I doubt you'll have trouble finding something you like.\\nLIES!!! Its all lies!\\n\\nThis station's address is at 41st Ave, not 39th. Why would they do such a thing?!\\n\\nEither way, this station is more just a transien\", 'actual_label': 37, 'predicted_label': 37}, {'text': \"t station for people to get to work at the businesses in the area. Its not set up to be a commuter station as there is an extremely limited amount of parking. The platforms are on the outside of the station so if you suddenly realize you're on the wrong platform you have to run all the way around. Aside from a couple of small shelters, there is no cover from the elements like most stations which have large overhangs to stand under. \\n\\nThis station almost seems like an afterthought.\\nI think this location is underrated compared to the other locations in the city, especially the one on 14th street.  The beer is cold, the staff are friendly, and the decor is really interesting.\\nGenerally I prefer Lowe's over Home Depot and Rona. \\n\\nThe staff at Lowe's are always very helpful, unlike HD where they can barely point you to the right aisle to find a hammer.\\n\\nI find the selection to be a bit more varied compared to Rona and I have a better chance of finding what I need. Not that I can really comp\\nlain about Rona's selection either, its just more of a preference.\\n\\nProbably the best part of the shopping experience here for me is the self-checkouts. They actually work well here. I find the one's at HD always have a hiccup which forces a cashier to come over and help. I've only ever had one problem at Lowe's when a tool box I bought only had an item number and not a UPC which their system doesn't allow you to type in manually.\\nThis place is not good. I wanted to like it. I really wanted to find some way to give these guys 3 stars, but I just can't.\\n\\nI came on a Wednesday night during what should be the peak of the dinner rush. The restaurant was dead, however they do have the patio out back and the guy in the kitchen was cooking so there must have been some other people around somewhere. A few doors down, Prohibition was raucous so it's not like there were a lack of people in the neighbourhood that night.\\n\\nI went with the blackened fish taco plate. With the tacos you get some beans\\n, rice, and a salad. The sides were bland. The tacos themselves were just not good. The tortilla was a cheap flour shell that you can probably buy at your regular grocer store. Except for the fish, the individual ingredients were pretty good. The problem though was that the tacos were drowning in sauce. I couldn't really tell what was on the taco. The fish was bad. I actually thought they maybe put pork on my taco by accident until I pulled a piece out and tasted it on it's own. Also, for the price, there is not near enough fish on the taco. There needs to be double the amount if you compare to other fish tacos in the city.\\nJust based on the name of this restaurant you know what to order.  If you're new to Calgary this is the place to get ginger beef.  They invented it!!\\n\\nWhat do you mean you don't know what ginger beef is?  Blasphemy!! Get your ass over here right now and become educated about the greatness of ginger beef.\\nI have a love hate relationship with Earls. I used to love it \\nback in the 80's and early 90's when it was more casual and had a fun atmosphere. Then in the last 15 years or so I just haven't really been a fan. Their menu is ok but it's a little overpriced for what it is.\\n\\nThis last trip was no different. The restaurant itself is nice. Great atmosphere, it's cozy, and not too loud. The staff were very attentive and came by regularly to make sure we were doing ok. I went with The Bronx Burger. It's basically a cheese burger with onion rings on it and some aioli. The patty was overcooked yet stayed moist and juicy on the inside which was the only saving grace as the meat was bland. The other ingredients on the burger gave some little bursts of flabout but for the msot part the whole thing fell flat. The caesar salad I got with it as a side was good, but nothing special.\\nThis place has opened up in the old Simply Zoup location.\\n\\nYou certainly can get a large amount of food here for under $10. I had the meatball sandwich.  It was a little dry for my l\\niking, maybe could have used more sauce.  \\n\\nThe owner's son was working and we had a nice chat about the business and how things were going for the new shop.  He seemed like he didn't want to be there but had the obligation to help out his family with their new business.\\nUnlike most DIY car washes in the city where you drive into a single bay and out the other end when you're done, this wash is one large building with individual partitioned bays.\\n\\nWhat I like about this location is the vast number of options on the dial for washing your car and that there is a vacuum in the bay. You don't have to brave the elements outside to vacuum your car then pull into a bay to wash. For the washing options they have things like the tricolour soap which you almost never see at DIY places and the more common things like spot free rinse.\\n\\nThe bonus with this place too is that you can pay with your credit card. Just swipe and do your thing. No need to worry about popping in Loonies before the time run\", 'actual_label': 37, 'predicted_label': 37}, {'text': 's out.\\n\\nMy one complaint here is that the warning beep needs to be louder for when your time is about to run out when paying with Loonies. You have to be almost right next to the machine to hear the beeping.\\nBefore coming into the store I couldn\\'t really say I\\'ve had any experience with the brand. I happened to be walking by and noticed that the Xbox demo store was gone and this store was now in it\\'s place.\\n\\nWhile the customer service here was great it wasn\\'t really enough to bump it up a star. The clothing is nice, but a little pricey for what it is.\\n\\nI was shopping for a casual blazer and asked what they had. They had one. While this was disappointing it made sense considering the clothing line. The person helping me though said they were getting more selection in soon. Good to know, however...after leaving here I went a few doors down to Showroom where they already had the new blazers in. Why did Showroom have them already and the brand\\'s own store didn\\'t? Odd.\\n\\nThe only other sligh\\ntly annoying thing about this store was that I had to leave my tea at the counter. Not a huge deal, but this isn\\'t really the kind of store where I would expect this policy. \\n\\nApril challenge 17/30\\nI\\'ve popped in here a couple of times to grab some beer when I\\'ve been hitting up the 7-Eleven next door. \\n\\nThe beer selection is good. Not as deep as Oak& Vine or Co-op, but they have the standard selection of macro and craft brews and sometimes something new to pique your interest.\\n\\nThe service can leave something to be desired at times. I believe this location is family run so I don\\'t expect that to change any time soon.\\nAfter having some tacos at Al Asador Mike S. and i came for a couple of beers.  The place is quaint and was all full on a Saturady night.  We sat at the bar as not a booth was to be had.  They were having some issues with their sound system but that didn\\'t matter since the hockey game was on.  The waitress was great and knows her beer.  After asking her to suprise me for \\nmy second pint she picked an excellent amber with a nutty flavour.\\n\\nThis is a great place to hang out on a random evening and enjoy a pint with some friends.\\nYou can come here to get a good, solid wiener!\\n\\nIn the case of The Little Dog I don\\'t think size matters. I went with the all-beef wiener. Because of it\\'s size it doesn\\'t fit into the buns very well as it is quite a bit longer, and has slightly more girth than the original wiener. I think I would be just as satisfied with and original wiener than it\\'s all-beef counterpart and would have saved myself two bucks.\\n\\nThe place is quaint and has that hot dog stand kind of feel. The menus are done with chalkboards and there are little trinkets placed all around. There\\'s a bright flashing sign above the awning so you can\\'t miss this place when walk by at night, as I quickly found out.\\n\\nI was there just before closing on a Tuesday night so I was the only customer. The owner(?) was friendly and after greeting me warned me that it would take \\n4 minutes once I ordered. Not sure if this is standard or just because I was there right before closing and he didn\\'t have anything pre-prepared.\\n\\nGo try The Little Dog\\'s wiener. I\\'m sure you won\\'t regret it.\\nCame to get a classic roll. When the employee scooped up my delicious pound of cinnamon and dough into the carton she asked if I wanted a little more of the \"sauce\" on top. HELL YES I DO! If you\\'re eating here it\\'s not because you\\'re concerned about what you\\'re about to put down your throat. So let\\'s not pretend that saying no was even an option. She loaded it up and sent me on my way to sugar coma bliss.\\nI was bar tending a friend\\'s NYE party and realized at the last minute that I needed some speed pour spouts. Hendrix was open on the 31st and it\\'s an item that they not only keep in stock, but have more selection of than I would ever expect.\\n\\nThe staff were right on top of things greeting me when I walked in and showing me where the spouts were housed. I wandered around a bit as \\nI had never been in before and saw all sorts of cool things that even a non-pro cook could use at home.\\nFrom a \"one stop shop\" point of view, this shopping centre is great. There are tons of stores from groceries, to hardware, to food, to clothing. However, from a traffic flow view, this place is a nightmare. The shopping centre is accessible by 3 entrances from 130th Ave and one on 52nd street. Everyone seems to only use the entrance/exit on 46th street which has a 4-way stop immediately once you turn off of 130th. Do yourself a favour and hit the next set of lights to get in or out of this place. \\n\\n4-stars for the shopping selection.\\n1-star for the gong-show of traffic planning.\\nThis is kind of an odd location.  When you walk in you feel like you\\'ve just entered a log cabin in the British Columbian wilderness at Christmas time (yes they still had Christmas decorations up in March).  The service was alright, though as I understand it we had excellent service for a Korean restaurant.\\n\\n', 'actual_label': 37, 'predicted_label': 37}, {'text': \"The food was good but nothing that would make me want to trek there again because I had to have the (insert chicken dish here).  The best part of the night was the drinking with all the other Yelpers.  With the combo deal of food and beer the bottles were $3 each.  Add onto that the shots of Soju that tasted like fizzy Kool-Ade and you've got yourself one table of good times.\\nKind of a crappy little pet store. It's really cramped and the things are packed so tightly you can't find what you're looking for. It didn't spend much time here as they didn't have the dog food I was looking for and was a little scared a shelf would fall over on me.\\nAlright gentlemen, this place is a much different experience than probably what you're used to when going with your significant other to stores like this in the malls. They're full service here so the staff are going to put your lady on a waiting list when you walk in (if they're busy) then whisk your lady away to a dressing room where you won't see \\nher for the next 20 minutes. You can sit awkwardly in one of the chairs near the front of the store.\\n\\nGuys, if you're shopping for gifts there's a ton of selection. Just make sure you know your lady's size as they carry the full range of sizes as opposed to the stores in the mall which only carry the popular sizes.\\nProbably about 15% of what I saw was funny.  If the show wasn't free I would be giving this place one star.  Did I maybe hit an off night, possibly, I guess only a return trip will tell.\\nI'm Stuft!\\n\\nMy third night, round two of the TIFF food trucks.\\n\\nThis is probably the best meal I've had from the food trucks so far. Great bang for your buck here. 4.5 stars (1/2 star loss because some menu items weren't available)\\n\\nFirst off, this idea reminds me of Pocket Dawg at the Saddledome in Calgary (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/pocket-dawg-no-title#hrid:-EcH5GwSsv4XLb-sst0V4w). Similar idea but Stuft is WAAAAAY better.\\n\\nThere's a varied choice of gourmet sausages to choose from. I went wi\\nth the Creole Turducken ($9), a turkey, duck, and chicken blend of meats with creole spices. For my choice of sauce I took the employee's suggestion and paired my meat with the sweet chipotle BBQ sauce. On the side I grabbed a cup of their Apple Fennel Slaw (4$). The sausage was rammed inside a nicely toasted and warmed baguette with the BBQ sauce oozing out of the top. The spice blend was fantastic. It was strong and in your face just the way you would expect from a Creole inspired dish. While I liked the flavour of the BBQ sauce I would have preferred a smokier flavour when pairing it with the Creole spices. Maybe their Wasabi Honey Dijon Mustard would have been a better fit. The Apple Fennel Slaw was decent. The apple came through nicely, but the fennel was nowhere to be found until my last bite. But when I did take that last bite I really understood what they were trying to get at with this combination.\\n\\nOverall a great job. I'll be back to get Stuft again.\\nThe store has a pretty l\\narge beauty area considering the size of the store. Other than that it's the standard HABA selection, pharmacy, and their pretty light on the grocery side.\\n\\nThere's a couple of entrances/exits so you can get into the store from a couple of angles.\\n\\nFebruary Food-Free Yelping Challenge 4/29\\nNew location right near my house! YEAH for me!!!\\n\\nThis was my first time trying Smoke's and after so many people talking good things about their original location, this was an immediate stop when I realized they had opened on Dundas.  \\n\\nI ordered the regular Prime Beef.  First off I found the regular size to be waaaay too much.  You can easily share the regular size with another person.  The flavours were well mixed though there could have been a little more onion.  \\n\\nTheir pickup counter is quick though they clearly have some new staff that they are getting up to speed.  The staff are friendly too.\\n\\nAlso, how can you complain when there are free stickers for the taking!\\nIn this former art gallery / \\nmetal shop is an empty, dead, bar.  When we were there, there was one other group.  The music was good, until we were about to leave when it got way worse.  You may like this place if you're a hunter, with all of the stuffed things around the bar.  \\n\\nOne cool thing with the bar is that they have early 20th century photography hung on the walls that they have scanned and blown up which they rotate through every few weeks.\\nFrom the outside you would think this is just your average coffee shop, but oh are you so wrong.  Stepping into this land of decadence is like being a kid in a candy store.  The walls are lined with unimaginable blends of loose-leaf teas and the display case lures you in with its erotic array of truffles, candied apples, and chocolate covered marshmallows.\\n\\nIt was too early in the morning for me to delve into any part of the chocolate wonderland before me, so I stayed focused and got my tea before my wandering eyes could betray me.  I was quite impressed by the loose-l\", 'actual_label': 37, 'predicted_label': 37}, {'text': 'eaf Earl Grey that I sipped on.

You won\\'t be disappointed.\\nAfter seeing this place pop up on Yelp and being featured in a newsletter/blog that I follow I decided to give these guys a try. They\\'re only a 10 minute walk from my house so I thought this would be a great opportunity to find a new brunch spot close to home. I popped in Saturday morning with my girlfriend only to find out that they\\'re doing brunch on Sundays only at the moment.\\n\\nNo matter, I grabbed a tea to go, of which I had 4 choices of loose leaf varieties to choose from. The woman working was very friendly and explained how they\\'re taking things one step at a time and slowly introducing more and more. \\n\\nRight now this is a great place to hang out during the day to grab a hot beverage and chit-chat with a friend or come in the evening for a cocktail or two. No open Wifi networks\\n popped up during my visit so this may not be the place at the moment to hang out if you\\'re trying to get work done/being a laptop hobo.\\nI held a UYE here during Yelp Eats week. Compared to the other restaurants I visited that week, this one wasn\\'t all that impressive. Overall it was fine, but nothing would really make me jump at the opportunity to come back here.\\n\\nI had the mac & cheese. It was tasty but definitely not worth the extra cash to get the sausage on it. You get a few thin pieces, I would have expected a healthy amount for the price you pay.\\n\\nThe service was fine, nothing over the top or anything to complain about. As the night went on we started to get crowded out at our table as a large group arrived and thought it would be a good idea to stand around instead of sitting at their table.\\n\\nMeh.\\nCherry is definitely the name of the game here. Everything is red. The walls, the lighting, some of the corsets on the bartenders, you name it. It\\'s a small space but it\\'s packed with\\n fun. The live music is always at \"blast your ears off\" level and the go-go dancers are always red hot. \\n\\nI was amazed on my last trip that the dancer working that night went straight through the entire night with only one quick 5 minute bathroom break. She danced up a storm.\\n\\nMost of the crowd here is really good. If you want to dance you can probably find someone to dance with or join the crowd in front of the stage. However, there are a few douches to watch out for from time-to-time. You\\'ll find a few guys that put on the tough guy act and try to push their way to the front of the bar or squeeze you away from a table. Not to worry though, their bark is worse than their bite.\\n\\n\\n\\nNovember 30-day challenge 2/30.\\nI\\'ve driven by for so many years. Heard good things, but finally took the plunge a few weeks ago.\\n\\nI went straight for the wonton soup, just the \"queen\" size as the king looked massive. The soup is a good size for the money you\\'re spending. I wouldn\\'t say it was anything above \\nand beyond wonton soups I\\'ve had before. But it hit the spot.\\nThis is one sexy hotel. From the second you walk up to the building it\\'s service, service, service here. The lobby is dark and cozy with a real wood fireplace and leather seating for while you wait for your rental car to be brought around by the valet.\\n\\nMy room wasn\\'t exactly spacious but it didn\\'t feel cramped. The design of the rooms is very modern. Lots of clean lines, simple decor, and everything is very thought through. When I walked into the room I was greeted with music playing, a nice touch. \\n\\nThere was a good size wall unit with space to hang everything I needed and stow everything out of sight. It was cool to see the ironing board was built into the unit and just folded out when needed. Probably the best little nuance of the room was that there was an umbrella. It was raining the weekend I was there so it came in handy the one night I went out.\\n\\nThe bathroom was very nice. It had the sexiest shower I\\'ve ever seen. \\nThe shower is essentially in the middle of the room and is glass on two sides. So you\\'re able to see who ever is showering whether you\\'re in the bathroom or the bedroom area of the room. There is blinds that you can close on the bedroom side it you\\'re looking for some privacy.\\n\\nFor this particular visit I came with some co-workers the day before a big presentation. The VP had booked a suite so we would have space to work while we put the final touches on our presentation. Unfortunately the suite we were in had temperature issues. It was hot the whole time we were trying to work. After getting someone to come look at the thermostat three times the VP asked to be switched to another room. When he came back from the front desk we were being upgraded to the presidential suite at no extra charge. That\\'s what I call great customer service.\\n\\nThe presidential suite is huge as you would probably guess.

It is great to fly solo at this place, but with the games and all they have to offer it is better with two or three. It was a beer night so we drank bud light with shots of fireball and played old Atari games and caught up on the latest gossip. We played the bowling type games and even watched beer pong such a great experience to lose yourself with beer.\\nStopped here just to see what all the hype was surrounding this store. Our Harley Sportster needed a new derby cover to. The selection of clothing and gear here at the store is amazing and the staff very friendly to help as needed with a size and such.\\nEnded up buying a new helmet here and it is so bad ass that it looks like the cobra\\n commander lid.\\nStopped in here for lunch, and it has been awhile. With the restaurant just opening around 10:30 am, one can get in and out soon. Surprisingly, this store must have a lot of fans since the lobby was pretty busy and there were other patrons that desired Wendy\\'s as much as we did.\\n\\nWith the expansion of their 4 for 4 meal we decided to try the Jr Bacon and chicken sandwich too. Everything was fresh and made to our liking not the \"way\" it comes. And they got our food order right the first time. Such success!\\nThe staff was very attentive to their guests needs and were cleaning as needed tables for guests. Thanks Wendy\\'s on Arville for having fabulous staff.\\nMy girlfriend flew in from Phoenix, staying in the Venetian one has to eat. When I picked her up she invited me to the table since she was just finishing up her lunch. The portions of her food were very generous too. I felt like family in this restaurant since they brought over a chair and brought water over asking if I \\nwanted a cocktail. I had to pass since we were going to Town Square to celebrate her visiting. \\n\\nThe Lleywn chicken was what she ordered and I shared too. It put comfort in comfort food . Their biscuits were like fluffy clouds. We were off after the server boxed our food and paid the check. I will be revisiting again.\\nThis store was located where I was running errands today and my puppy needed some treats, so we popped in here to keep her happy. The store was very organized and it seemed as though the store was spring cleaning since a lot of bones were on sale. I was glad to be here to be apart of these sales. It is always wonderful to go shopping for something and your going to by it anyways and it\\'s on sale.\\n\\nThe store is very organized again by dividing the aisles for dog and cat boundaries with there food. When I paid for the order the cashier was highly\\nprofessional and made small chit chat while we paid. She even added that when your using your card one can make a donation that g\\noes straight to charity for our fury babies. I had to add to their cause, anything for the animals. Petsmart is always where I buy why puppies treats and bones since I know they are guaranteed and safe for my puppy to eat.\\nAmazing, outstanding, should I keep going this restaurant not only has a fabulous name but it makes the best egg and bacon sandwich I have ever experienced. The clerk was a fantastic host explaining the name and some of the history of their restaurant. Then gave her recommendations, which is the egg and bacon sandwich. It comes on a fluffy roll and the egg looks like that in their pictures.\\nPopped in here tonight while was wandering through the Wynn. I have never been in a Givenchy store and did not know that we had one here in Vegas. See the Wynn showcases it all! I love the brand Givenchy and the wonderful quality that is put into all of there handbags, which are like amazing pieces of art. \\n\\nThe staff was very pleasant and friendly allowing the customer to browse \\nthrough the store. When I visited this store tonight it was quite busy too! I did find a small handbag that caught my eye. I was able to look at it with the store attendants help. I did fall in love with it, but they did not have it in black, and the chain was too short. So although I loved it and it would be a wonderful addition to my handbag collection it did not meet any reasons to really get use from it! I\\'ll sleep on it to see if it is truly necessary for me to have it. This store is so fun and full of cheer that I was glad I discovered it.\\nAfter going trick or treating we got the craving for the fourth meal, so we went to this Taco Bell and had mexican pizzas for all, and soft taco supremes. There were no tricks in their treats here, just good old fashion food. Our service dog accompanied us this Hallows eve, and gave a fantastic review for the rug by the front door.

No lip from me, settled the tab and we were off!\\n\\nWe were seated at the Oyster Bar by the hostess; did not have to wait for a table or anything!

It did not get in the way of her service to our needs; so she handled her judgements privately. Which we are all entitled too!

When the spilt checks were delivered at the end of the meal; it\\'s was f\\nlawless no mix ups at all. Props for this.\\n\\nSo let\\'s establish a baseline for who is who. Zach was non Yelp friend; and Darren Yelp friend (first meeting) Great now that\\'s out of the way, could be a year later so pay attention!\\n\\nZach and I had one tab with my very first plate of oysters, in which we shared. The small plate of these oysters was only $16 too. Zach had Clam Chowder soup and I had a Caesar Salad! There was nothing really special here just typical Caesar $8, the Clam Chowder was decent but not the greatest. The oysters smelled good and came with all the fixings for proper flavor. Both of the boys were insightful on how to properly put on hot, lime, and the salt. \\n\\nThe oyster properly loaded I picked it up and did not gag. I\\'m so proud of myself! Beer and cocktails to the rescue I\\'m sure. Liquid courage baby! Using the spoon, I emptied the contents in my mouth and let it roll down my throat. They are slippery and slimy but not in a bad way. Swallowed it and let my senses fee\\nl the oyster. All good tingling thoughts and actions, a sip of the wine and back to the salad!\\n\\nThis dinner event took place a couple weeks ago; I am applauded to report that I do not remember what Darren had! It did look good though! After a little conversation we my friend and I took Lyft home. Being drunk the only way to get home safely! Darren was not to the level of drinking that we had achieved. Always nice to meet Yelp friends in person! Here\\'s to trying oysters for the first time and new friends both yelp and non-yelp!\\nWhile waiting for our table to be called at Green Valley Ranch restaurant inside of the casino we decided the couches here were more than inviting so decided to sit and rest in comfort. We decided to go with a drink that will not take our appetites, so decided on chai tea latte.\\n\\nThe customer service here was great and very laid back. I was exciting to sit and relax in the comfy inviting couches and enjoy my cell phone game and tea. It was highly relaxing too. Th\\ne ambiance of this location is so chilled and quiet. Perfect for cell phone caught up and chai tea.\\nWhile at the Silverton Hotel this morning I decided that I needed to remember and reflect on those that served what better to do that but with a shot. I decided to use jack as that celebratory shot to honor those that have gone but are never forgotten, and to those that are still here keeping all of us safe and free. The bartender was refreshing and even made small talk for a while but I did not stay long. \\n\\nThe lights in this bar for so amazing they change colors on their own too. The colors shift from soft hues of purple, red, and blue. It is so relaxing and such a great concept and edgy atmosphere. The bar chairs are all captains chairs which are very comfortable. At each of the chairs is a gambling machine. I did not play today but have in the past. These are the older type machines that have blackjack on them . That\\'s my game too!

The outlet mall is open even until midnight too. These outlets are less than a mile from my house and during the day I do not enjoy shopping here since it is always busy here. Towards the evening time it thins out and a patron may maneuver the way without running into other individuals. The restaurants inside the mall are varied from Chinese to American. I enjoy having a Cinnabon and Starbucks this close to my house in a mall setting. Two of my favorite stores here are Spencer\\'s and Hot Topic and I can find all this and more at the outlets .\\nToured this business and their beautiful ground as a home school event outing. Trisha was our fabulous host and guide, but due to filming constraints we missed the guys of Tanked. Trisha also informed our group that since we did miss them we can call anytime and come back and meet them at no extra charge. Wow! What greatness that is!!\\n\\nT\\nhe outside door of the business is surrounded by a coy pond and is so tranquil. The whole staff was so warm, friendly, and down to earth. They are all animal lovers and in there office building facility rescue macaws that have to be given up and give them such a great home and habitat to exist in. They have turtles, dogs, cats that the employees can bring to work with them. And there is lizards that live at the office all the time. What could be better a great fun career and whenever needed bring Fido or Fluffy to work.\\n\\nTrisha our amazing host with the most filled us in on all the powerful way that ATM got a tele show. So inspirational that it took them three years to get on tv at the request of clients telling them over and over again that you guys belong on tv. Now they are dreams do come too.\\n\\nOur groups was shown \"the top secret\" tanks that are going to be coming up and it will be good too. We are all sworn to secrecy. So cannot report on that just watch the show you won\\'t be disa\\nppointed. The tour even took us into the bosses office to look at the fish tank. How humbling that he allowed strangers to oogle his office. This is a fun and educational way to experience an afternoon, or get that next fish tank. If I could afford one it would be The Nightmare Before Christmas edition..... just a hint. It would make a great show idea.\\nThis 99 cent store is one of the better ones that I have seen in Vegas, I believe that it is so popular that this is why sometimes the shelves are bare. It seems that sometimes the stocking crew is busy busy that they have to do double stocking. \\n\\nThe staff is very pleasant here and have never had any issues. The lines are usually very long and the wait time for a cashier is high too. But for the deals that one scores here it is worth a little extra of my time. I was shopping for a life party, and found so many items that will make the table setting look elegant and luxurious.\\nVisited the Pet Expo in February of 2018 and stopped by the b\\nooth belonging to the Spay and Neuter clinic. Entered the drawing offering for free set of shots at no charge. My husband and twins were whom attended. He was the one selected as the winner,  Chris Rice. He did not live to see our the day our puppy gets shots again but that\\'s another story.\\n\\nSo I get our puppy Sugarbaby\\'s records to the office and was commenting to my daughter they want their customers to review the business on Google. I told my daughter we do Yelp reviews and come to find out the office manager here Carolyn is a fellow Yelper and we\\'re now friends. She was so helpful and even set me at ease honoring the gift we had for our family even though the individual it was in could not claim. They were so gentle with Sugarbaby making sure not to stress her . I found a new vet for when my baby needs anything having to do with the vet. Thank you to Carolyn and the ladies of this office your the greatest and you too Trey.\\nBreakfast sounds so good l,but it\\'s dinner time. In a major\\n where can I find amazing breakfast food for dinner. Oh, that\\'s right this is Las Vegas! Using my handy Yelp app and my handy Google senses I find what I am seeking. It\\'s off to the Planet Hollywood for dinner. \\n\\nThis cafe is rather large and it sits in the beautiful Planet Hollywood Hotel and Casino. When I walked into the cafe I was expecting average and wow, I was blown away by the atmosphere here. The wonderful desserts that they are selling are such great eye candy. Although this trip to the cafe I am taking in the breathtaking deserts from afar. These desserts although are probably heaven would destroy all the hard work that I have done thus far. I had bacon and eggs instead; this is at least good for you.\\n\\nThe service was great and so was the team work between the employees. I decided to take my order to go. After I placed my order in real life I had a little wait. I went over to the casino bar for a drink before going home. When I came back my order was all ready to go.

I use the pharmacy exclusively here and have nothing evil to share about their services. In fact instead I sing the praises of the pharmacy and their techs for always getting our pills correct and answering any kind of questions that may arise.\\nWhile at the mall this weekend they were handing out free cookies to mom's and coupons for free cookie with any purchase. The free cookie was a sugar cookie with rainbow sprinkles, which was really good. The cashier behind the counter was really busy with a line of customers wanting great cookies. The cashier was very friendly and helpful. They have a deal where the customer can save and get for cookies; this is what I bought. You buy five cookies and get the sixth free for $8.99. \\n\\nThey sel\\nl slurpee's here too!! I had to go back to those years when I could drink these and have some. What I did not drink the twins did! And it was great, very cherry on such hot days now. I had to buy the red velvet brownie since it is my favorite of all the dessert flavors. The red velvet brownie was delicious and paired well with cherry slurped.\\nWanting to reward and surprise the men of the office and show my appreciation for all the love and support over the last couple of weeks I decided to reward them with custom made cookies. The group of guys at my office are so great and need to be reminded how wonderful they are. They are very much like typical guys the best way to get their attention is with some kind of baked treat or those amazing comfort foods they all long for. Wanting to go light with these 100 degree days now here to stay, cookies seemed just right. \\n\\nI found Cookie Zoo with help from Siri's returned searches. There website is a breeze to use and all of their reviews on Yelp\\n have nothing negative to offer. I consulted with their price list online before ordering. One always wants to know what the price is first. When I called the business the party at the other end was professional and took my order with absolutely no issues. This company does do specialized ordering but they offer a wide range of their own cookie and brownie created trays already.  I decided that the brownie/cookie tray would do just fine for my guys. I am having them specialize the tray with Thanks. It's a nice and simple request and made plans to pick it up.\\n\\nWhen I finally did make it to the Cookie Zoo the tray of brownie/thanks cookies was all ready and boxed to go. I am so pleased with the wonderful job that they did making my thank you to the office guys come to fruition. Guess what too, I did not have to bake them either. The ordering was smooth and so was the pick up. For the tray that I ordered it had 16 mini brownies, and 28 cookies that read Thanks in varying colors. I let the\\nm create and use colors since they are the experts. I was not disappointed at all. Now I can reward the guys for jobs well done. For they will know how much they are loved and appreciated!\\nBreakfast sounds so good l,but it's dinner time. In a major where can I find amazing breakfast food for dinner.

Of course, I check it all was perfect with the order and the fabulous smells coming from the box. They even remembered silverware and napkins.\\n\\nIf one is seeking the best desert then search no further. I decided to indulge in decadence today. One cannot enjoy sweets alone. The twins accompanied me on this trip. The twins had to have one Las Vegas Shake each. The ice cream was so great in this Shake. The brownie in a jar; was an al a mode style that tastes so authentic. The pink box donuts speak for themselves.\\nEnough said.\\n\\nWith this my second visit, I will continue to frequent this restaurant again and again. Especially, when I have a sweet attack. This is a great place to treat and cure these attack's.\\nJust killing some time popped in this Harley \", 'actual_label': 38, 'predicted_label': 38}, {'text': \"store just because, it is never a bad decision. When I walked into the store one can feel the power of the Harley and your need to be one with the road. The staff was very helpful and greeted me right away. This is a smaller store but it is stocked properly all the same with the right merchandise. The abundance of ladies clothes here is awesome. So many summer shirts, perfect for the hot summer days ahead. \\n\\nOne of the great things about this location and others on the strip it might seem that there prices are really high but it is not true. Since even at the Harley Store across from the LV sign, and at RedRock Harley there prices are the same. I can feel good knowing that the sparkly Harley T-shirt that I did buy for $68, is the same price at the Harley Store across from the LV Sign (I checked)! When I did pay for my purchases the sales clerk was so helpful and friendly. She even offered the twins a mini size water for free. Such great customer service and amazing clothing. It's a win\\n win!\\nAttended an event at the Silverton where this Bass Pro is attached to the casino and was pricing archery arrows. We are out of them or damaged beyond repair. We even found some arrows that were glow in the dark cannot wait to shoot them. \\n\\nThis store is a museum to all things hunting and fishing. They sell everything too. The atmosphere of the store is creep at times since some of the scenes look so real. Especially the deer display in the front of the store. The store staff is so helpful and not even overbearing. One fun and lots of fun is the restrooms...\\nSeeking provisions for the week, one can always count on Whole Foods to provide exceptional healthy treats. The salad bar here is a great place to make a salad too and eat after your shopping. \\n\\nVisiting the produce department first I am always amazed at the varieties of fresh fruit and veggies here. This trip I did find some amazingly fresh red grapes. They were at the peak of freshness too. I love to snack on snow peas, and \\nthey sell these lovely veggies individually so that you can take what you need by the handful. The price for the snow peas was $5.99 a pound; which is sort of steep but at least the grapes were on sale. \\n\\nThis store does not have an exclusive aisle dedicated to all things hydrating. The selections of different waters are located throughout the store and in the deli section where it is chilled. I have a fondness for water and did not find the brands that I normally purchase; but they did have Volvic in stock. The name brand water that Whole Foods sells is particularly good too. But it's not those designer waters. \\n\\nThe salad section of the store on the other side of the store is where I was able to make my own salad. The salad bar selection that they offer here is quite huge. There are so many fresh choices that one can choose to put on top of their salad. They offer fresh cut veggies and fruit, plus a great mix of beans other small odds and ends to top the salad off with. The dressings\\n they offer range from basalamic, Caesar, to sesame to put that last bit of perfection of top. \\n\\nI enjoyed my salad in the new dining section that all of the Whole Foods have added to their stores. Now you can do the shopping and then enjoy a fresh salad or other little something with a glass of wine then head home. This restaurant is so relaxing too. The chairs seem more like long chaise lounges. The color choices they decided on compliment the space so well. The lounges are a cream color with the tables a beautiful wood grain color.\\n\\nThe atmosphere of Whole Foods is always welcoming, this store is no different. I was able to enjoy my salad here in beautiful comfort. I will visit again since it's Whole Foods; how can one stay away!\\nNeeding to mail a letter and when you need a stamp Murphy reminds us of life happening and not having any stamps. Fast forward to the reason for visiting. Prior to relocating to Henderson this used to be the post office I visited. It was close to my house a\\nnd open 24/7. When I went in the building I decided to get stamps with a teller rather than the automated machine. I was also seeking the new scratch and sniff ice cream stamps. \\n\\nThere was no line and I was grateful for that. In the conversation with the mail teller she delivered me the bad new that the fun scratch and smell stamps will not be unveiled and available at the post office until June 17. That being a bummer. I did find some other stamps that are forever but they are not scratch and sniff. The mail clerk was helpful in providing the many types of stamps and taking payment from me. This was a great visit to the post office since I did not have to wait in line, got extra stamps of defeat Murphy, and found out some new information.\\nMexican food is delicious and my lunch decision for today. This is my first trip here, so if one has never been here there is a trick to ordering. \\n\\nWhen you walk in the atmosphere of this taco establishment takes me back to the days of when I did f\", 'actual_label': 38, 'predicted_label': 38}, {'text': 'ield research in Oaxaca, Mexico. Plus all of the staff understands Spanish. Its lucky that I abalone some. At least enough to order. \\n\\nI love this place everything is so quaint and welcoming. What a wonderful concept for this restaurant. Now I know why they are so busy! \\n\\nI figured it out fast that I wanted line/counter four since this is where I would order the type of protein that I wanted for the tacos.  \\n\\nAs I watched the cook, through the smoke haze place steak on the grill my old factory senses just went haywire. The smells that danced in my head as the smoke rose from the steak. The cook was very comfortable with his position and cut the steak flawlessly. I only wanted cilantro as a topping; this trip.\\n\\nWhen I followed the line around to the last counter I also ordered an ear of corn loaded minus the mayo. Having never experienced mayo on the corn I passed this trip. \\n\\nWhen I took that first bite of the corn the red chili peppers just fill your mouth with so much flavor. The cor\\nn was cooked perfectly too. The iced cold beer is the only thing that can break the burning pain from the chili powder on top of the corn. It\\'s splendid burning bliss.\\n\\nThe staff here are amazing and very knowledgeable about the menu. The authenticity that has gone into the menu and restaurant experience is so wonderful. The way the guest orders their food is so exceptional; since the individual gets to interact with the kitchen staff, even if it\\'s through a window. \\n\\nI will be coming back for some more steak tacos, plus they serve burritos here that I have yet to enjoy! Can\\'t wait! Plus they serve beer and wine which is a must for any Mexican food\\nExcept no substitutes! Starbucks is the go to coffee and espresso house that deserves such superb recognition. \\n\\nThis Starbucks is located on Fremont Street in the middle of tourist central. It is the only Starbucks in the area, so for those of us die hard enthusiasts that crave our Starbucks we have no choice.\\n\\nStarbucks as a company recent\\nly has been in the news again, but this time it is to support its employees. They are allowing ten sick days paid to their employees. This is a first from any company nowadays. Most companies, even larger entities have stopped all paid time off first and foremost!\\nNow as an employee of Starbucks you can relax a little and know if your child gets sick your covered. Congrats to Starbucks for recognizing and taking care of their employees. \\n\\nThis particular visit to Starbucks I went in around 2-3 pm in the afternoon. The cashier was pleasant and in a fairly good mood. You could tell that she was forcing that smile and social pleasantries. The barista on the other hand was so talkative. Asking all the regular questions that everyone gets asked. My favorite is: \"Where are you visiting from?\"\\nWhen they hear that I say Las Vegas they immediately relax. The tourist look and face goes away. I\\'m not saying the barista was negative in any way. She relaxed knowing we share a commonality, and touri\\nsts are a whole another world. Plus it is usually tourist that are rude and impatient waiting for their drink. \\n\\nI cannot tell you how many times that a tourist, especially at Starbucks in Las Vegas at various locations all over Vegas where a tourist will yell at the barista: \"Where\\'s my drink?\" They get rude with the cashier saying: \"Why are the drinks so expensive?\" The cashier does not set the prices of the coffee, they only sell it to the customers. Even the managers don\\'t set coffee prices. If you want to complain call Starbucks and yell at them. You wonder if tourists that are rude act like that when they go home to their local Starbucks.\\n\\nYou are probably wondering why I am including this rant about how tourists are rude to the poor Starbucks employees. The individual that was in line prior to me was standing next to the bar waiting for their drink. While I was ordering I heard this individual yelling at the barista to hurry up. I have to be somewhere. Your so slow! I should of \\ngone to Dunkin Donuts. Maybe that person should of. Belittling others is not something that I tolerate, but I kept my mouth shut since they were not yelling at me. The barista handled herself well. She had a thick skin, and informed me that this happens all the time. \\n\\nThis Starbucks is a superb store where the employees have to deal with all sorts of individuals. It is an excellent store that is clean and comfortable. The outside seating area is such a great place to enjoy your coffee and watch the different images of individuals rambling along. Grab your coffee and select where your best seat to watch the amazing individuals of Fremont from afar!\\nWhen I arrived at the Linq this morning I thought as I walked past this joint; wow that would be a bad ass place to eat!\\n\\nYou know what it was better than I expected. Deciding it was a great day to lounge by the pool here at the Linq the memory of this restaurant and the fact I was drunk are my reasons for visiting.\\n\\nI am so glad that I gave', 'actual_label': 38, 'predicted_label': 38}, {'text': ' into temptation since the food here is amazing. And absolutely needs more exploring when I am sober!\\n\\nAs I pulled the barstool out the bartender was handing me a menu. Wow such prompt and professional service from the get go. The bartender was lively and full of energy. He recommended a rum and coke since they were his favorite. I know right slow down; let\\'s have dinner first. This visit stayed strictly platonic and professional.\\n\\nHe poured the drink immediately and as we talked shop; I mentioned that I wanted dessert before dinner. My kind bartender who knows the menu so well,can quickly deliver the desserts and give details about those said desserts. Bravo properly trained employees. Us dessert specialist appreciate this level of quality when discussing dessert!\\n\\nOne always knows the rarity of educated employees that enjoy themselves at work. So to properly give credit to this fantastic bartender I can only Yelp about it! Since I was way to lit to remember anyone\\'s name. Sorry for t\\nhis unnamed; masked hero! But he delivered this same quirkiness and style to all his guests.\\n\\nDessert was on the agenda and as I stated prior it is the main reason for visiting. I had the strawberry shortcake sundae which even came with vanilla ice cream. This heavenly treat was served in the largest glass they could find. This dessert was very special it was perfection in pink; with succulent strawberries all circling the vanilla ice cream topped with extra whip cream (since I asked for more)!\\n\\nThe steak burger was fantastic too; but I took this one home. When I got home had half the burger since the portion was so large; or maybe because I eat less now. Either way it was a really good burger and silenced my burger craving for now! The furry dog got the other half. Will I return here. Of course; this burger establishment is on my special forever forbidden bookmark list. Sounds tantalizing no. That\\'s because it was!\\n\\nGo out to the Linq and try for yourself; you will not be disappointed\\n. The decor of the restaurant is so loud and in your face; like a biker bar meets upscale with a twist of wicked lime! Now you go be the judge and find that diamond in the towels bartender; he will take good care of you!\\nWent here for drinks after a work function and I was blown away with the restaurant from the minute that I walked in. The staff is highly professional trained and friendly. The atmosphere of the restaurant is amazing and has so much positive energy. I ordered drinks we were celebrating so we drank champagne after about two we headed out to dinner, but it was not here. I am going to celebrate Mother\\'s Day here so will update later when try food.\\n\\nNow here it is Mother\\'s Day and I am having my mothers dinner this restaurant is even more beautiful in the day time. I love the lavender that the servers where as well it is a nice touch to the ambiance of the restaurant. \\n\\nThis trip I had another Caesar salad which is always good and tried the meatball sandwiches with zucchin\\ni fries. The portion size of the salad is so large that I could not finish it. The meatball sandwich were slider style and the taste of the meatball with its red sauce was so delicious. The freshness of all their ingredients shows in the wonderful taste that all come together on your tastebuds.\\nHave you ever established \"in your head\" the  wrong idea about some place? \\nThis is confession time.... here I go! \\n\\nHooters, is one of those businesses that \"us\" ladies do not frequent, unless accompanied by our gents in our lives. Being single now, I had some of my male friends come see me over the Veterans Day holiday. They planned this trip and here I am living it up as a single lady. My daft friends from Los Angles claim that my life is now different and I need \"current\" cultural life experiences. I was so surprised at how many ladies were eating here too!\\n\\nOur visit started with a lovely gentleman that was the manager of the facility escorting our party to the bar. The trip to the bar from\\n the hostess/host check in at the front of the restaurant was ideal. I passed tables that had all sorts of individuals eating and drinking some of the best wings I\\'ve ever seen! The other customers of the restaurant seemed so happy and comfortable. \\n\\nThe bar seating was full, so our party of three was seated just south of the bar by at a table that was semi-bar seating. The table was set high with larger chairs so we had a birds eye view. We brought our drinks from gambling into Hooters with us, so we started with water. Wanting to keep hydrated was a super smart choice since we we\\'re still drinking. One has got to love Vegas; drinking playing Blackjack then with drink in hand which were Margaritas we carried them to here to eat! Our server was a beautiful tall friendly individual that was ready for our order. \\n\\nAfter looking over the menu, my two \"fun male friends,\" asked our server what her favorites on the menu were. Even though it had nothing to do with what we were going to order.', 'actual_label': 38, 'predicted_label': 38}, {'text': ' After the male banter (which I am sure this beautiful siren of our server receives) I spoke up and ordered the rubbed wings two 15 piece; one in mild and one hot flavors with extra bleu cheese. As she walked away the server sent me a look that was something only girls can understand! Ladies you know what I\\'m talking about!\\n\\nAs we waited for our order I drowned the boys chatter to a hum, wink or a yes. The decor of this restaurant is stunning. The natural wood with the stain is so appealing. It feels natural and very homey. It makes you feel like those nights in front of a fire pit with hot cocoa, your favorite book, and your dog cuddling under your favorite blanket while the crackle of the fire and the smell of the wood dance in front of your eyes. The lighting is dimmed\\nenough around the bar and above the tables that you can see what your trying to read, but it\\'s not overwhelming on the eyes to create that focus that we need for the day to day push and go. All one really needs is a m\\nore comfy chair to put their feet up and then it would be heaven! They even have the tele in focus for the game; all is wonderful! \\n\\nMore focused now the smells are killing me as they call orders out from the kitchen. These are not my wings. Each time the servers walk by the plates are so colorful and yummy smelling. Men must know when their food is coming, since one of my friends said looks our foods here as the server put the wings on the table. Food dar that has to describe it but, it does not matter since the food is here in front of me. Taking that first bite off of those rubbed wings was fantastic. The smells and taste of these delish delights will forever taint any other place that tries to claim the \"best\" wings! \\n\\nHalf way through the mild rubbed wings we needed round three. Sticking with Margaritas the server was real quick and attentive to our need for drinks. On to the spicy ones! The rubbed spicy wings were delicious with just the kick that I enjoy. The wings flavor was no\\nt so hot that I could not taste the chicken of the wings; just the right balance. The margaritas were on the rocks with salt which quenched the burn of the wings beautifully with the perfect balance of hot and sweet.\\n\\nIf it were not for my gentlemen escorting me here I would of never known the joy of this sexy and cool establishment! The lovely ladies are oh so beautiful and some of the friendliest staff ever! They are genuine and even approachable! The bar staff makes the greatest margaritas. I was so excited to be a customer here and have the greatest wings ever! Now it\\'s time for you to go and try. Don\\'t be intimidated it\\'s so much fun\\nThe messengers that send signals are getting crossed and having some issues inside of me. My doctor decided that this is an issue that needs to be addressed. This nerve pain has usually can only be helped with yoga, but  should not be there in the first place. My primary doctor believes it could be a larger issue that is beyond his science and magic t\\no make it all go away. \\n\\nMy primary doctor handled the referral and the Neurologist office staff called to make the initial appointment with me. This all went smooth and all the phone conversations with the staff were professional. I am seeing Dr Yu but only for a brief moment this visit, since the evaluation and medical history is with the nurse.\\n\\nThe reviews here are impossibly horrible and it seems that a lot of prior patients had a lot of issues. I feel for them when trying to get healthy if the specialist one is seeing can be frustrating. I would love to know what doctor the patients had issues with. The front staff I believe cares and they are very busy. The front office staffs handles a large influx of patients that visit constantly and they see a lot of those here. They continuously answer the phones that are always ringing. When I checked in and gave the paperwork back to them the staff was happy and so very nice. \\n\\nThere are all sorts of patients that are seen here, there are\\n some that come in on stretchers. It must be a normal thing here. With this being my first visit I had an appointment with the nurse then saw the doctor. Dr Yu was very pleasant and a wonderful doctor. He is hard to understand but I had no issues with him communicating his directions to me.\\n\\nOne issue that did occur during my visit was the bathroom in the waiting room ended up with feces all over the place. They had to close their lobby restroom since it was so gross and unhealthy. The staff handled this is a professional way and allow customers to use the restrooms in the back as needed.\\nSlipped disc in the lower back many might think that life is over, not true! We can be taught how to live that that said injury!\\nHence why I\\'m here!\\n\\nWalking on egg shells and wondering if that next twist is going to throw out a muscle or nerve is no way to live. This has been my plight for too many months. The pain pills irritate my stomach and only mask the pain that I feel! Time to rewrite and redo', 'actual_label': 38, 'predicted_label': 38}, {'text': \" how I tolerate pain in my life. This next chapter has led me to physical therapy finally!\\n\\nWhen I was referred to this office I was impressed at how professional and friendly they were. No one likes to get up and go to the doctor three to four times a week just to cause oneself some pain and punishment. But to keep the pain at bay and get rid of the damn pain pills I all game. I want to be able to run again with my new puppy and for just me. That is why I am ready to put that dedication in to better my body. My mind has been healed sort of; now it's time to finish the body and work on that soul! \\n\\nOn the first visit I met with a physical therapist whom escorted me to one of their private rooms to access the damage that I had caused. The motorcycle did a number on me and my full range of motion! It can be corrected though! He measured all these different ranges and ways that I could and could not bend. He assured me that me that I was in the right place to make sure that I correctly be\\nnd. In time I will have my full range of motion intact and be running. This brought a smile to my face. There is nothing like lacing up your Nikes, putting in the ear buds, grabbing that puppy leash, pushing play on Spotify and smelling black sunshine. Yes if you did not know that was the euphoria that one experiences running with the puppy!\\n\\nInto week two now of physical therapy has me with a pinched nerve, but with the aid of the amazing staff here that will be history after they are done with me. In the beginning they had me stretching and doing little to aggravate the situation I was in. Now we have moved to weight training but controlled and slow. I remember that it was the tortoise that won the race, not the hare! This injury is going to take slow progression. The hands on job that they provide to each and every client is so amazing. The staff are so comforting and professional. They guide you every step of the way. While still adding that personal touch to meet each clients need\\ns. \\n\\nThe establishment has some of the best medical professionals that I have encountered thus far. They are always on point and deliver the best quality care to the patient. The front desk medical staff remember by name the clients that come and go. They always have a bright smile to greet you before and after your workout. The staff on the floor guide each client in baby steps first then the hard stuff after you can handle it. The care is personalized to each individual that they treat. It is kept clean and sanitized. It is cleaner than a real gym. The massage staff work miracles when they rub the knots right out of you. I cannot tell you how many times I have come in with sharp agonizing pain. The massage therapist work their magic and I'm up and able to do the therapy that is required that day. Amazing!\\n\\nAfter that spill or fall, motorcycle accident, or whatever mess that you get into this is the facility that you want physical therapy from. The staff is kind and gentle. Attentive \\nto the needs of the patient. You are not a number here. In fact it's the opposite the staff will go out of there way to ensure the safety and well being of everyone in their care. I still have a long road ahead of me, but at least I know that it will be successful. I may be in pain now but their promise is to correct that. I trust that they will deliver. Now it's that time again see you all on the mats!\\nSuch a cool and hip place to eat!!! We happened to be down here today when they were doing the ribbon cutting and it is an amazing place. Such fun and upbeat, the atmosphere of the restaurant is new and just full of life . The best thing so far on their menu is these lollipop corn dogs; they are magic in your mouth. So check it out.\\nGot out late this morning and needed something to eat. Stopped here since McDonald's breakfast is so good. The only issue I had was that the bathrooms were dirty. Plus the coffee that I ordered was supposed to be with a Carmel flavor. I ordered a large iced \\nCarmel latte drink and there was no Carmel. \\n\\nOne thing that I did like about this McDonald's was the team work between the employees and it was genuine and not fake. The general manager was so happy and helpful. She was taking orders and even do the work stuff not barking orders like you see with a lot of managers. This is so rare.\\nBowling, what is not fun about it! Throw that ball down a shiny lane and hit the pins at the end of a big mechanical machine that re-racks them! Is that all bowling is! Of course not!!\\n\\nThe game of bowling is more than just fun it takes genuine talent and energy to figure out how to line up that huge circular ball to knock all those pins down in two tries! That sounds like a lot of work! Depends on the individual! Bowling is calming and a tactile high of you play properly. \\n\\nBowling at South Point is just a place where you can come and sharpen those basic skills to maybe get on a league or just know that deep down it will be a strike almost every time that \", 'actual_label': 38, 'predicted_label': 38}, {'text': \"colorful ball comes into contact with those shiny pins. I played three games with Daniel this time around and while he beat me the first game, games two and three were winner take all. \\n\\nThe atmosphere of the bowling area is very comfortable and welcoming. I felt nothing but fun and glee while we were throwing huge round and colorful balls down that slippery lane. The chairs swing back and forth if you need to sit. The whole time we were playing there was no need for a chair. Bowling can release endorphins that push you to win, win, we will take nothing else! There was no need for sitting while we were playing. The excitement was all around us as we wore those stylish bowling loafers and sent our bowls down the alley. \\n\\nThe staff was super friendly when we went to pay for the bowling. You pay before you play which is customary. No free lunches! The shoe rental is reasonable at $3.75 a pair, in so many many sizes. Although the style of the shoe is all the same. The wonderful staff of So\\nuth Point provided a coupon book for me when I signed up for the players card. There was a coupon in the book that provides three free games when you buy three. The cashier took the coupon and was extremely polite and professional all the way! The staff of the bar and snack shop were pleasant too! The employees here are always ready to assist a guest no matter what it seems!\\n\\nNow to the food, bowling believe it or not works up an appetite. After the first game I was wandering around and you know it discovered the snack bar. At the time the smell of pizza was emanating from behind the counter. The prices are extremely reasonable so I went all in Vegas style and ordered a large Pepperoni Pizza. The price with a large drink was $17.00 for the pizza and drink. One cannot beat that. There are no refills on the drinks though, so I was glad that I ordered the large. Pepsi is there drink of choice, sorry Coke fans. \\n\\nWhen I brought the large pizza to the table I got only raves from Daniel on h\\now much I bought. He approved of the large pizza. Oh that's right, gents are content if there not make them a sandwich.\\nOpening that pizza box filled my olfactory senses immediately. The wave of freshness was immense. I picked up the first slice and all that cheese j just oozed over the side of the slice, but still stayed on the pizza. That bite of the pizza was even better. The Pepperoni was amazing and just the right amount. The cheese was extra and made for a delicious balance of cheese to Pepperoni. The sauce was just perfect. Usually after you finish a slice the crust for me gets tossed, not this time. The crust was the best part of the pizza here. Just think about this: the pizza was from a snack bar. This was some of the best snack bar pizza I've ever had! Highly recommended to try the pizza here, even if you do not Bowl.\\n\\nWhether you come here to bowl or eat pizza now you know what's the 411 at South Point. It is very family friendly and for all sorts of age groups. To be hones\\nt there are more 65 plus seniors that bowl here than us young individuals. Bowling is great exercise too! Come and try bowling for yourself with that special someone, solo, or with some twins you will not regret any of it! Try the pizza from the snack bar or you will regret this. Their is a bar just in case you need liquid courage! Now go and have fun while working out at the same time. Yeah!\\nBeing locals here it takes us awhile to come out and see the touristy places. It is too bad that we waited so long to see this one. Our family loves everything Avenger or Marvel. The cashier gave us two for one tickets since we forgot our NV ID. That deal was just as good for us. The tour is amazing this is a great way to kill an hour and who does not love being their favorite marvel character. We picked the Hulk, but my son actually finished his tour and was Black Widow. Was so much fun and learned so much new stuff about the marvel universe that I did not know.\\nOld glory gently and proudly blows\\n in the breeze above, down below are the gas pumps that keep us moving!

The store that is attached is a local convenient store called Terrible's. I know what your thinking right,it's all wrong! Terrible's should be a play on words as their slogan, but for this purpose the store is attached as the entity to go into if you run into issues with the gas pumps. This is great since the store is 24/7, and it includes a living human being for an issues an individual could have while pumping gas that the human can rectify.\\n\\nAs I pump gas into the Honda VTX I can watch the local C\", 'actual_label': 38, 'predicted_label': 38}, {'text': 'wouldn\\'t have minded so much (as I could\\'ve sat closer to the door left ajar, which allowed light to come in), but then the music blaring out of the speakers overhead was just too much!

The crabcakes (topped w/ roasted red peppers and garnished w/ wasabi and mustard mayo, the latter I opted out) also came w/ a side mixed greens salad and a citrus vinaigrette. While this dish wasn\\'t the best-looking of all the dishes I had that afternoon- don\\'t let the pic of the bread pudding fool you, it was the best-\\ntasting, but this isn\\'t saying much.  I didn\\'t care for the watered-down flavor of the citrus vinaigrette, and frankly, the crabcakes had enough flavor, so the lack of dressing wasn\\'t a big deal.  I don\\'t know if I\\'d order them again, though...  What was a big let-down was the braised shortrib sliders\\' dish.  Now these sliders looked fantastic, but the shortrib pieces were so sinewy and/or fatty, that, as much as I tried, I couldn\\'t chew through any!  I really wanted to like these, bec. of those gorgeous-looking fried onion strings that sat on top of each slider.  Thankfully, my server offered to swap them for something else, and it was w/ a little sadness that I said goodbye to those onion strings :\\'(\\n\\nLately, mussels haven\\'t appealed to me, so my server\\'s suggestion to try FM\\'s wasn\\'t giving me much hope.   Surprisingly, these mussels tasted OK, and the price is right (for happy hour), and if I weren\\'t already not disappointed in the darkness of the pub; the loudness of the music\\'s v\\nolume; and the sub-par quality of the shortribs, I may have enjoyed them more.  With the hope of finding something good to write about, I ordered the bread pudding.  (At this point, I should\\'ve just given up.)\\n\\nThe bread pudding dish, which you\\'d think, looking at the pics I took, would taste good,  was a disaster!  It was dark in the pub, yes, but the dish looked like they just placed slices of bread down, showered them w/ dried cranberries, and poured some white chocolate sauce.  Something was amiss- was it even baked?  How was it prepared?  There wasn\\'t enough cream sauce to cover most of the bread.  I was told that the bread was indeed soaked in the cream, and then baked, but this bread pudding had to be the worst I\\'ve ever tried.  The pics looked great, but don\\'t be fooled...  \\n\\nThe server was friendly, and most of the stars reflect her attempts to appease me, but I didn\\'t enjoy my experience there, and would never recommend this place to anyone.\\nTottie serves up two of the BEST c\\nurry dishes I\\'ve eaten in the valley- the chicken green curry and the salmon red curry.

The duck salad is pretty good, too.\\n\\nMy friend and I also tried a Chinese entree (the ma po tofu), but we didn\\'t enjoy it.  I completely gave up on it after two bites (and anyone who knows me and my love for food will tell you that a very telling sign of my distaste is when I don\\'t even care to take leftovers home).  My advice is to steer clear of the Chinese dishes (Tottie is from Thailand, btw) and just order from the Thai menu.  Alright, alright, just skip the ma po tofu.  You\\'re welcome.\\nCame here two days in a row!  Yesterday, I met a GF for brunch.  It was her first time.  She noticed that the restaurant ordering and design exuded a European flair-- order at the counter, and self-serve napkins, cups, and sugar cubes.  (She didn\\'t notice this at first, but staff didn\\'t mind fetching the sugar cubes for her.)\\n  She doesn\\'t drink coffee and wanted English breakfast tea, so I let her use my free Maya tea with Yelp check-in.  She ordered the Papa K, while I went with a Mocha, made with 55% Valrhona chocolate and rose essence, and maple butter crepe (no surprise there). http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/crêpe-bar-tempe?start=400&select=KPfw5w57yJTw3cudbjIwdw#KPfw5w57yJTw3cudbjIwdw  When Leah (one of the staff members) delivered my mocha, GF immediately ordered one for herself.  While we both thought the rose essence was a bit too strong, I finished mine and she abandoned hers (and ended up asking for just black coffee, instead).  Whether it was the additional food aromas/flavors mixing in with the rose essence, or just the mocha-rose combo mellowing over time, I was able to appreciate the beverage to the last drop.  GF tried another sip and said, \"No.  Still too strong.\"  Her Papa K entree looked and sounded terrific!

I also ordered a choux, made with the same batter as a cream puff/profiterole, accompanied by date butter, and a brioche du jour, which came with date butter and macerated strawberries. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/crêpe-bar-tempe?start=400&select=bc_cBNSEyYy6jo5orkSlNA#bc_cBNSEyYy6jo5orkSlNA  I didn\\'t care for the choux\\'s soft textures, but I very much enjoyed the date butter!  I also loved the brioche.

I was able to tell one GF to take advantage of the free tea at Yelp check-in by downloading the app, but forgot to let the other one know, as she ran late and I had no time to tell her.  They both LOVED the tea!  So much so, I\\'ll have to give it \\na try on my next visit.  I again ordered the brioche du jour, which hadn\\'t changed from the day before.  This time, we all enjoyed it (GFs ooh\\'ed and ahh\\'ed!), while GF yesterday must\\'ve tried a bite of the toast sans date butter.  She only tasted sour berries, and apparently, she doesn\\'t do sour.\\n\\nTastings for the day were sweet potato chips with date butter on the bottom, house-made yogurt and local Agritopia radishes, with fresh-ground black pepper and salt, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/crêpe-bar-tempe?start=400&select=FmFSjGiFVaIpuLi8rEGroA#FmFSjGiFVaIpuLi8rEGroA and two mini-flutes of rose hot cocoa (this time the rose/cocoa ratio was perfect!).

After many weeks of craving cupcakes, I finally relented and made a quick stop at AJ\\'s to see if the boulangerie had cupcakes for sale.  I found a few cupcakes from Tammie Coe\\'s and My Dad\\'s Favorite (the clerk\\'s fave out of the two) bakeries.  Out of the two, only MDF was available for purchase by the mini-cupcake ($1.50)-- TC\\'s came in half-dozen or dozen batches.  (MDF also came in singular regular-sized cupcake packs for $4 each.)  I was jonesing for varied flavors, such as those I\\'d seen in Cupcake Wars, but all I had to choose from were chocolate minis w/ coconut-flaked frosting, or vanilla minis w/ multi-colored and glitter-dusted vanilla frostings (so uninspired), so I chose the coconut.  I should\\'ve let the mini cupcake sit out to warm up to temperature for awhile, bec. the frosting w\\nas so hard when I took a bite :(  The cake itself was OK, and I liked the bit of frosting that had coconut flakes in it, but all I could taste in the frosting was butter- yech!  Oh, but wait!  I didn\\'t just try the cupcake here... oh no.  My attention was drawn to the salted caramel and BACON brownie when the woman ahead of me chose it for herself (along w/ a slice of key lime pie and a carrot cake).  May I sample the brownie, please?  Oh, yes?  Why, thank you!  I really shouldn\\'t have asked for the sample, bec. I loved it so much, I bought a whole piece ($2.99).  Why do I torture myself like this?  I really don\\'t enjoy working out on the treadmill!  No, that\\'s not wholly true-- I don\\'t like the first 15 mins.  But still!  I don\\'t need to splurge on a brownie, much less one that is frosted w/ a chocolate ganache, salted caramel, AND crumbled bacon pieces!  \\n\\nNext time you\\'re craving for something savory AND sweet, try the salted caramel and bacon brownie and thank me later.\\n\\np.s.

Therefore, when I\\'m dining in Scottsdale, I am either at Jewel of the Crown or Indian Delhi Palace on McDowell.\\nSaw \"Oklahoma!\" here a few years ago and enjoyed the show.

Noticed Philippines\\' San Miguel beers available here, too (at least they were last year).  Laloo\\'s goatmilk ice cream used to be sold here, but today\\'s visit yielded none in the aisles.  I\\'ve always wanted to try their hot foods, but it was only tonight\\'s dinner that appealed to me- salmon with stuffed crab w/ a white cheese cream sauce.  Sides were an awesome scalloped potatoes w/ bacon and cream sauce and very dry-looking \"honey- glazed\" carrots.  Thinking I\\'d have dinner elsewhere, I asked only to sample the potatoes, and they were so del\\nicious!  Next time, plans be da*ned, if AJ\\'s serving anything crab-stuffed and those scalloped potatoes, I\\'m definitely going to dine there!\\n\\nOther than for the specialty-food counters, you won\\'t catch me shopping here... too expensive!

I arrived earlier, so I waited for her at one of the tables out at the heated patio.  Nice space, though I didn\\'t like the fact that my view of the cozy bar area was blocked from the table that I was first taken to, so I requested to be moved closer.  No problem.  I also found that some areas in the patio can be private (as in you\\'re hidden from street view), so if that\\'s what\\'s important to you, be sure to canvas the area so that you may request your spot!\\nAs V. already pointed out, we did have a problem w/ the dirty appetizer plate.  I had to use the women\\'s restroom while\\n we waited for the food to arrive, and when I came back, Violeta was already snacking on complimentary bread and butter on a very attractive blue and yellow print saucer plate.  There were many varied styles stacked beneath a pizza stand, so I rifled through a few before finding one that matched hers.  Wouldn\\'t you know it that the one I chose was one of two that had grime on?  V\\'s plate seemed clean enough, but the third from the top, as well as mine (which was second from the bottom of about 7 or 8 stacked) had oily smudges on them- mine looked like a schmear of butter.  :(  Needless to say, I didn\\'t even try the bread, and Violeta dropped her piece when I showed her my plate...\\nAnd yes, the wine was served in a whiskey glass (looking at whiskey glass varieties on nextag.com for comparison as I\\'m typing this).  Call me old-fashioned, but I like my Cab served in a Cab wine glass!\\nNow let\\'s get to the pizza!  The happy hour menu features a few wines by the glass at discounted prices, m\\nost of the pizzas half-off, as well as some of the appetizers at lower prices.  Today, she ordered the roasted chicken (HH $6.25) and I the four cheese (HH $4.95).  Both pizzas were very good!  So good, that despite the dirty plates\\' incident, I came back the ff. Tuesday for another HH jaunt- stay tuned for an update soon!

The dispenser held powdered soap, which I happily perceived as something akin to a sugar scrub (it was dark in there, and my hands were already wet before the soap landed on them, so I just felt the \"beads\"), but another customer said, in what sounded like a disapproving voice, that it was powdered soap, \"just like what I used to use back in grade school.\"  Just goes to show you that \"one man\\'s treasure is another\\'s man\\'s trash...\"\\n03/19/10\\n\\nKitschy, fun country-life decor.  There was about a 15-minute waiting time.  Lots of older citizens waiting, which made for interesting chit-chat amongst the women.  It\\'s refreshing when a restaurant\\'s setting allows people to feel comfortable enough to interact among strangers-- Mom and I encounter so many \"closed\" individuals on a daily basis at work, so this is a nice change of pace for us. \\n Staff here seem friendly and busy, but efficient.  At least, ours was.  One complaint: it\\'s a bit cramped in here.  It would be nice to have a little privacy from other neighboring tables, especially when I spied a room in the back that had maybe four 4-tops, and only one was occupied.\\n\\nCan\\'t recall what Mom ordered, but I wasn\\'t surprised that she didn\\'t enjoy it-- the menu description definitely did not appeal to me.  Website does not list a menu, and all I can recall is that it was an omelet w/ a couple of fibrous veggies (snow peas and something else; it was a strange combo, of that I\\'m sure of.  Chestnuts, maybe?).  I went w/ a Belgian waffle, two eggs, and bacon.  Coffee was weak, but our server offered to brew a stronger pot.  Nice!  While we waited for our selections, she brought out some mini-muffins to enjoy, and that we did!  We both really liked the bran.  I also enjoyed the zucchini-- Mom thought she detected cinnamon (not a fave of hers), but I think it\\'s the nutmeg she \\nwas referring to.  Then again, I may be mistaken...\\n\\nWaffle was, well, a waffle.  No accompanying fruit compotes or coulis to liven things up.  I always bring my own 100% organic maple syrup, because while most restaurants say they offer maple syrup, it isn\\'t 100% pure, but a blend of maple and corn syrups.  (If it smells like Mrs. Butterworth\\'s, it isn\\'t 100% maple.  Just sayin\\'.)  Eggs were cooked to over-medium, just that way I like \\'em.

Jeff was his warm-hearted and most-generous self, as usual.  After exchanging pleasantries with both Jeff and the staff, and Jeff notifying me of a change in th\\ne way he formulates his buckwheat crepes (now a combo of buckwheat and AP flour, and not the whole buckwheat of old), I decided to try the ham and gruyere buckwheat crepe, with an egg on top (additional charge), as well as \"The First Time,\" filled with Nutella and sliced bananas and garnished with bruleed bananas, whole walnuts, and walnut shavings (!).  I chose a cup of CB\\'s latest drip, the Burundi varietal Kiryama from Madcap Coffee.  (You may buy a 12 oz. bag from crepe bar for $16.99 plus tax, or from madcapcoffee.com for $15.50 plus tax and shipping.  Check out their FAQ link for two shipping options.)  It was such a lovely day that I elected to eat en plein air.\\n\\nWhile I waited for my crepes to arrive, a delightful surprise was in store for me*, courtesy of the chef (didn\\'t I say he is a generous soul?).  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/crêpe-bar-tempe?select=6VW790O-IRvw2gs_gb5VUg#6VW790O-IRvw2gs_gb5VUg  This was Jeff\\'s take on the strawberry shortcake.  Oh la la!  This dish was\\n nothing short of a gift sent from above!  :)  The combination of the caramelized crunch of the sponge cake, charred in some spots, but not too much that I hastened to trim it off**, cream (my guess is a rustic mix of ricotta and mascarpone, but I\\'m sure I am wrong, for it was very light, and mascarpone can sometimes be a little too rich.  Not for me, personally, but for some...), fresh, sliced strawberries, a strawberry reduction (on the right), and a magnificent, and you\\'re-such-a-tease tiny serving of a peanut butter reduction on the left (miracle!) left me speechless and dancing as I almost inhaled the plate!

If you love buckwheat, ham, and gruyere, then you must order this crepe NOW!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/crêpe-bar-tempe?select=QcNdkQMEQXf1U1YcdRRfmA#QcNdkQMEQXf1U1YcdRRfmA  My server came by to check on my progress of crepe consumption, estimating that I should be ready for the second crepe in a few minutes, but there\\'s no way I\\'d finish this and have room for another, so I asked for a box\\n.  She soon obliged with a sheet of aluminum foil and said she\\'d have the kitchen fire off The First Time.  Sacrebleu!  While the photo did not do it justice, the crepe\\'s flavors and textures were extraordinaire!  Must. Try. Soon.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/crêpe-bar-tempe?select=DqpP0rGwFH6OPqU6jbh82A#DqpP0rGwFH6OPqU6jbh82A  Again, I couldn\\'t finish the crepe, nor had I wanted to- not after the \"amuse bouche\" of a strawberry shortcake, half of a savory crepe and most of the egg (I don\\'t eat charred edges), almost two cups of coffee***, and now half of this sweet not-so-little number, I was finished, and happy.  Very happy.  :)\\n\\nIt was a gorgeous addition to my happy memories of perfect breakfasts- thank you, Jeff and company!\\n\\n*Jeff actually sent out teasers of the strawberry confection to other tables, not just mine.\\n**The metabolism of charred food releases free radicals, which in turn may be hazardous to your health if you don\\'t counteract with antioxidants- beware!\\n***I had t\\no call my server back after her third, or fourth checkup to request for a coffee refill.  My coffee had grown cold, and not once was I asked if I needed more.  Otherwise, I\\'d have rated this experience five stars!\\n7/6/11\\n\\nArrived early for the OYE party at bld, so I decided to check out their happy hour.  It\\'s a good thing I did, too, bec. the margarita I had here (priced $3 on the menu card, but I was charged $3.50) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bld-chandler?select=-iHx38oezn6KQER2Aw8ytQ#-iHx38oezn6KQER2Aw8ytQ was one of the beverage highlights of the evening!  The meatball mac \\'n cheese, however, needs a tweak-- while I enjoyed the mac \\'n cheese portion of the dish, I found the meatballs and sauce to be too acidic. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bld-chandler?select=UFsIK9G_6MZxb-GvezRedA#UFsIK9G_6MZxb-GvezRedA  If I wasn\\'t trying to slow down my body\\'s absorption of alcohol (I\\'d just gotten a massage before, too, so circulation was revved up!), I wouldn\\'t have eaten as much as did, \\nand I left more than half in the bowl.\\n\\nStill, what I had tried was enough to keep my mind open for more happy hour adventures here.  Take a look at the interesting HH food menu!\\n02/04/10\\n\\nHappy hour w/ Violeta.  Loved the furniture (dark wood and slightly reminiscent of old Mission churches or Spanish villas that one may find back home- I\\'m from the Philippines), and the ambience.  I liked how the doors/paneling opened up to a patio- it was a little chilly that afternoon, but I imagine that w/ the perfect weather we have now, happy hour at TLR would FEEL nice.  What I did not like about the LR is that it was NOISY.  Now, I didn\\'t mind so much that the music selections were eclectic (country to jazz to classic rock, and even Motown); After all, we were AT The Living Room, and, as in different households, one can find different music playing.  No, it was just too noisy.  I\\'d hate to imagine what conversing would be like if the doors opening up to the patio were closed...  What I also no\\nticed was that while there were smatterings of all age groups (there were even children running around in the patio!), most of the people there were in their mid-40s to mid-50s.  I usually check out happy hours at restaurants for the food offered, and not to meet potential love interests, and this venue would definitely be somewhere I\\'d just go for the food MYSELF.  I can\\'t even picture being able to do some work on my laptop here... maybe it\\'ll be different in a few months?\\n\\nService was a little bit lacking, but the place was packed!  A chair was even taken from our table (I didn\\'t mind, but I think V. did, since she was keeping her fingers crossed that her hubby would join us).  As for the food, we were going to keep it light by ordering bruschetta.  (I knew that TLR was affiliated w/ Scottsdale\\'s 5th & Wine, and I had tried and enjoyed the bruschetta there.)  The bread pieces here were sliced much thicker than those at 5th, and while they may have reminded me of Postino\\'s bruschetta', 'actual_label': 39, 'predicted_label': 39}, {'text': ', the flavors, while good enough that I enjoyed the dish, made me wish I was at Postino\\'s, or even at 5th & Wine.  Especially when it was so noisy we had to raise our voices to hear each other; Violeta wasn\\'t enjoying the music; and children were running around not two feet away from me.\\n\\nI would like to give TLR another chance, and hopefully, my guests and I will find a younger crowd (no children present, please!) to enjoy the ambience, music, and food with.\\nMorning Glory offers great French toast http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/8rlTOw0IA1TENURMBJpaXw?select=-4feMjhfMVa68yPeJJeZ1Q#-4feMjhfMVa68yPeJJeZ1Q and good omelettes.  The Farm Kitchen sells great sandwiches and a few tasty pastry selections.  Side salads are pricy considering the size portions.  Haven\\'t had a chance to dine at Quiessence, yet, but I\\'ve read great reviews.\\n\\nBTW, one can also get massages here at The Retreat!  I\\'ve never been, but there is a sign that says \"by appointment only.\"  There used to be a giftshop where o\\nne can buy natural beauty and skin products, but that\\'s long gone (I used to get e-newsletters).  Those products used to be sold at a location next to the vegetarian/vegan restaurant that used to be on Goldman and 5th in Scottsdale, but that also closed a year or two ago...\\nThought I\\'d try The Cove Trattoria\\'s happy hour today (3/12).  Half-off appetizers and all wine-by-the-glass are $5 (!!).  Yes, the restaurant\\'s new location is now next to Ruth Chris\\' Steakhouse, but it seems that the staff is also new; the bartender and server would sometimes get quizzed on a menu item\\'s ingredients or on beers.  I found it both entertaining and enlightening!\\n\\nOrdered the Caprese (orig. $7.99) and a glass of Villa Trasqua chianti (orig. $10).  While the caprese was good, I felt that the dish needed a few more drops of EVOO to enhance the flavor of the mozz; unfortunately, the balsamic vinegar didn\\'t really add much to the dish.  I LOVED the roasted red pepper aioli that accompanied the bread baske\\nt, though.  I\\'d return just to lap this dip up!  The chianti was straight out of the fridge, so I couldn\\'t really savor its bouquet.  [After partaking in a few venues\\' happy hours, I\\'ve noticed that none have come close to Roaring Fork\\'s GENEROUS pour (read: a topped-off 6 oz. decanter!)  TCT\\'s was around 4 oz.  No worries, as I didn\\'t even finish my glass...]\\n\\nI hope to visit again soon with group in tow and try the mussels app and either a pizza or another entree.\\nGood tandoori chicken.  Skip the bland lamb curry.  Spinach curry was delicious; eat it with basmati rice.  Excellent samosas.  Heavenly gulab jamun.  The carrot squares were delicious, as well.  Wash it all down with chai.  $9 lunch buffet.  Can\\'t wait to try again!\\n12/08/09\\nCame in to have more of the asparagus bruschetta during happy hour (can\\'t complain about the $3 price tag), but I must say that it seems like everytime I order a plate of this, the toast slices get smaller and more burnt!  Thank goodness I found a new \\nfave to fall back on, but I get ahead of myself...\\nOne of the bartenders on a previous visit told me that one of his two fave apps off of the HH menu (the asparagus being one) is the Raw Bigeye Tuna, so I decided to order it.  (I was vacillating between the tuna and the smoked salmon, but went ahead w/ the tuna.)  The presentation was very nice, but I could definitely detect a strong fishy odor :(  I flagged down the manager and told him my complaint, and he replied that the special of the day was a white fish that the kitchen staff was cooking up a storm w/ in the back, which may be what I was detecting, but he\\'d be happy to replace the app with a new one or even w/ another choice.  I went w/ the smoked salmon, instead.  \\nThank goodness for the tuna mishap... Textures and flavors abounded in the Smoked Salmon app!  I absolutely loved the marriage of smoked salmon, super-crisp potato galette, and chive creme fraiche!  (I\\'m sitting at a neighboring grocer- The Kitchen- as we speak, and \\nI\\'m just hoping that the bruschetta plate and side of mac \\'n cheese do well to keep me from wishing I\\'d gone to Bloom, instead.)  Now, did I have room for dessert?  But, of course!  I had their banana dessert plate, which consisted of a banana bread muffin iced w/ banana frosting and a slice of banana drizzled w/ a chocolate sauce; five frozen varied chocolate-covered slices of banana (toffee brittle, oreo, peanut, to name a few); and a banana milkshake!  I would definitely order this platter of sweets again :D\\nAlong w/ a glass of red, I also tried the Black and Blue Mojito- a concoction of 10 Cane rum, muddled mint, fresh lime, raspberries, and blackberries.  Very delicious!\\n12/15/09\\n\\nCame back for more happy hour research!  This time, I procured an indoor bar two-top that was close to an electric outlet (so that I can surf the internet!).  I don\\'t recall being able to access any wi-fi, so for now, I\\'m going to say that\\'s a negative on wi-fi capabilities.  I started out w/ a glass of ', 'actual_label': 39, 'predicted_label': 39}, {'text': 'red, of course, and two apps plus two pizzas: the braised veal meatball, the melted pecorino cheese, a roasted chicken pizza, and the pepperoni and sausage.  Pizzas were good, but I wouldn\\'t order any of them again- I found the roasted chicken too sweet this time, w/ the apricots and caramelized onions; the pepperoni and sausage is one of those \"take it or leave it\" deals for me...The braised veal meatball was a BIG disappointment- this arrived in its own personal caulderon, complete w/ a lid, and when I opened the package, the scent that emanated from its depths instantly turned me off :(  I can only describe it as something you\\'d come across in a dank, smelly locker room.  Wet, stinky socks.  I\\'m shuddering as I think about the aroma.  And the taste?  Well, it tasted what rank gym socks might taste like if one were so inclined to take a bite.  Correction: what rank gym socks that needed a little more parmesan cheese sprinkled on top might taste like.  Ugh!  When the server came back \\nfor a check-up, I mentioned not enjoying the meatball, and he promptly asked if I wanted to order something else, so I went w/ the sweet Italian sausage.  All was not lost, however, after the disappointments that the meatball and pizzas imposed on me; While the sausage was being prepared, I did enjoy the melted pecorino cheese!  Gooey sheep\\'s milk cheese accented w/ thinly-sliced Granny Smith apples you layer on toast pieces and drizzle w/ spicy truffle honey!  I could order just this and be happy w/ the time spent at Marcella\\'s!\\n\\nThe sweet Italian sausage was very good!  Nicely-seasoned and slightly spicy, it came w/ some sauteed vegetables and a lot of au jus.  I\\'d order it again :)  At some point of the evening, the manager did come to speak w/ me and apologized for the meatball fiasco, and offered a complimentary plate of parma prosciutto bruschetta- a lovely dish I readily recommend if you like prosciutto and tomatoes.  I especially liked the ricotta base upon which the tomatoes, \\nprosciutto d\\'Parma, and basil sat.  The bread was cut a bit too thick for my taste, but I\\'m sure that\\'s just me.\\n\\nFor dessert, I tried the profiteroles- three profiteroles filled w/ pistachio, chocolate, and honey vanilla Ciao Bella gelato and covered w/ a warm chocolate ganache.  They were amazing!!  Loved the crunchiness of the pastry, and gelato w/ chocolate ganache (so silky and rich... just the way I like my ganaches) win me over everytime :)  I\\'d go through the parking nightmare that is a fact of life outside Marcella\\'s anytime just to order this again!!\\n03/12/10\\n\\nFour stars for the food and atmosphere, but I deducted a star for the service.  I was to meet a couple of friends for happy hour here, but I arrived almost two hours before they did.  (He was waiting to get off work and had to swing by to pick up his wife, and I was getting hungry!  They knew this, so it wasn\\'t an issue.)  \\n\\n(As you can see, it\\'s been two months since our visit, so I forgot the name of the awesome serve\\nr that was first assigned to me... silly me, I know, but I can say that it was a name of Hispanic origin.  HOWEVER, I do remember quite well the name of the server that took over our party, (a fave gemstone of mine), since my original server was assigned to work the patio.  We all considered leaving, but my friends had heard a few Yelpers and me talk TMI up a few days before at the Yelp In Bloom event and wanted to check out the ales and food.)\\n\\nOK, onto the food!!\\n\\nI came to check out the happy hour app menu, which I sadly found does not exist.  While there are beverages discounted during happy hour, the list isn\\'t very long.  I understand that there\\'s only one or two wines by the glass on it, as well as one or two draft ales.  I think he tried the Oak Creek Nut Brown (thumbs down) and two glasses of the White Rascal (thumbs up!).  (Another testimony to the subpar service showed us by that-who-goes-by-a-jewel\\'s-moniker is that he was overcharged by not one, but TWO beer selections.  I\\nt\\'s always a good idea to check your receipts!).\\n\\nSo what did I eat??  I had the terrific RB & C, made w/ roast beef, muenster cheese, and horseradish sauce on a baguette.  If you haven\\'t already done so, you must RUN at this very moment to TMI and order one!!  Everything about this sandwich, as well as the side salad that accompanied it, was faultless!  From the deliciously aromatic, crusty baguette; melty muenster; ample portion of roast beef- cooked to juicy perfection!; and the divine horseradish sauce, I was in \"thunderbolt city\" with every saporous bite!  It was a battle of willpower vs. a basal desire for full sensory gratification.  Willpower won, my Mom able to enjoy the other half-sandwich later that night, but only because I was going to order the Artichoke Heaven, a dip which consisted of atichoke hearts and a blend of three cheeses, to share with my friends (they had it w/ LT chips, and I had mine w/ crostini and house-fried potato chips).  This dish went over well!!  Defi', 'actual_label': 39, 'predicted_label': 39}, {'text': 'nitely a must-order-again selection.  Friends\\' selections were the Griddled Cheese and house-made salsa and LT chips.  Both sandwich and salsa were very tasty!  FYI: my friend had a hard time trying to order a Tequila Sunrise.  First, our server wasn\\'t familiar with the cocktail.  Second, we were told by our server that the barkeep did not know what it was either.  After a few minutes, and by then, I started asking if I could get a Sidecar (no), a bartender finally came up and said that they lacked the grenadine to make a TS.  (No on the Sidecar, bec. they didn\\'t carry lemon juice.)  Thought I should mention this.\\n\\np.s.  I just remembered... when I first arrived and sat in the main dining area of TMI, I was only one of maybe three people sitting there.  I found the music to be disconcertingly loud.  I can\\'t recall if I put in a request for the level to be lowered...  By the time my friends arrived, it was busier out in the patio and in the main dining room; we\\'d moved to the community \\ntable next to the bar area, and we were practically shouting at each other as we tried to carry on a conversation.  Not ideal.  At least, not for me.\\n\\nFYI, I heard from Matt D., the owner, that eight draft beers, two wines by the glass, and all cocktails are discounted during happy hour.  I\\'ll have to go back soon and see if they\\'ll make a revised Sidecar for me using lime juice!\\n02/05/10\\n\\nMet three friends for lunch- a first-time visit for all of us.  Was pleasantly surprised to find that this restaurant had such a nice atmosphere-- pretty tapestries adorned the walls, and the windows had nice wooden embellishments.  (I was expecting another Haji-Baba-type venue bec. of the location.)  Our server, who struck me as either the manager or the owner, was warm and friendly, and even chimed in when he overheard us discussing a documentary on the food industry (Food, Inc.); I\\'m used to a curt greeting, head down, followed by a pen landing on an order pad.\\n\\nOn to the food.  Kat and Kevin, bot\\nh vegetarians, ordered a falafel pita and a sanbusek lunch platter.  Violeta H. and I ordered the chicken tikka platter (hers w/ rice and mine w/ salad).  All of the dishes looked wonderful!  The falafel pieces looked so delicious, I almost wished I\\'d ordered that instead until I saw the marvelous-looking plate of sanbusek that landed in front of Kevin, which made me wish I\\'d ordered THAT instead!  (I usually stay away from fried foods, especially at Middle eastern venues since many use corn oil for frying.)  They both found the dishes quite tasty and \"easy on the stomachs,\" with only the complaint of the sanbusek\\'s small portion size.  The chicken tikka filets looked moist, slightly charred at the edges, and had a beautiful amber-orange hue from the marinade used.  We all very much enjoyed the hummus!  One of the best I\\'ve tried in the valley (although Phoenix\\'s Persian Garden Cafe and Chandler\\'s Pita Jungle still top all the venues I\\'ve tried)!  I actually found the tikka to be a bit\\n dry, yet still very tasty.  The salad was also delightfully crisp, the lettuce sweet, and the dressing light and zesty (really liked the cumin on top).\\n\\nSince none of them wanted to have dessert (we were all quite full and satisfied), I bought some walnut baklava to-go.  These pieces were ambrosial!  They were just the way I like them- phyllo still crispy, yet had just enough honey syrup to coat your tastebuds AND your fingers.  These were literally finger-lickin\\' good!  I wasn\\'t surprised that these were made with a butter and margarine blend (I asked), which means I won\\'t be ordering them again, but if this fact doesn\\'t bother you, then by all means, you HAVE to try the baklava!\\n02/07/13\\n\\nFinally stopped by to visit Jeff at the new place-- I was a huge fan of Truckin\\' Good Food.  I was hoping to make it to the restaurant after my acupuncture session, but that ran long, and by the time I arrived here, it was already closing time.  However, Jeff did not send me home, even when I said \\nI\\'d be back in the area in a couple of weeks.  He asked me if I drank coffee, and I said \"yes, preferably black,\" but I also drink cappuccinos from time to time.  He asked me if I knew what a cannelle was, I said yes, and after setting me up with a mug of drip coffee, he went into the kitchen to surprise me with something fabulous.  (If you\\'ve met Jeff Kraus, you know he always has his thinking cap on, creating recipes of great-tasting food while you and he speak!)\\n\\nWhile I waited for this lovely surprise, I surveyed my surroundings and admired the wall art, all made by local artists.  I fell in love with the counter backsplash the moment I laid eyes on it.  (Blue is one of my favorite colors.)  I really like the energy here, and I hope to return very soon to check out their dinner menu-- the resto re-opens at 5 pm, and last seating is at 730 pm.  \\n\\nThe cannelle tasted fantastic!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/crêpe-bar-tempe?select=7WOcX83WBMjpC5twU_wRcg#7WOcX83WBMjpC5twU_wRcg  The p', 'actual_label': 39, 'predicted_label': 39}, {'text': 'astry was caramelized on the outside and had a lovely \"done\" texture, while the inside was akin to a souffle\\'s custard-like interior.

I\\'ve only approved of the service supervisor\\'s  extra \"suggestions\" once, when I thought I was going on a road trip.   So BM, the guy who regularly supervises the work done on my car,  tells me that the cabin filter needs to be changed ($60) and (elsewhere) that there\\'s \"condensation\" forming that may \"create mildew\" ($90).  I went with the cabin filter change.  I unsuccessfully tried to find my car to have a look at the actual filter, but someone in the garage must\\'ve noticed me looking, because BM found me back inside the waiting room and asked me if I needed him.  I said I wanted to see the filter, and he brought back a used filter and a brand new one.  I thought to myself how may I be assured it\\'s the actual filter from my car he\\'s going to show me, since I didn\\'t see it coming out of my car?  When he brought it back, together with a new filter for \\ncomparison, I didn\\'t think a change was necessary, and none of the male clients who were eavesdropping said anything either (and really, why would they?

It was a little chilly that evening and I had a feeling that Mamang wouldn\\'t be open to dining al fresco, but I asked for patio seating.  When I spotted a few heaters in place, I knew we\\'d be fine.  What a delightful surprise when we scored a table next to the babbling waterfall we encountered on our way in!  Nervous energy spent over Mamang feeling too chilled outside was wasted; Indeed, she even complained of feeling too warm!  No worries though, as cousin Melissa eagerly swapped places with grandma.\\n\\nWe shared flaming saganaki, \"award-winning\" gyro dinner (consisting of lamb and beef, scrumptious rice, sauteed veggies, and just-perfect lemon-roasted potatoes), side Greek salad, and flaming galaktoboureka (custard baked in crusty phyllo, topped with vanilla ice cream, flamed, then drizzled with caramel sauce) for dessert!  We three over-ate, but no one grumbled.  Mamang had never experienced Greek cuisine before, so this beautiful eveni\\nng (outdoor dining, ambience- lighted palm trees, waterfall- and tasty food) was a perfect send-off for our gorgeous grandmother, who was homesick living on US soil for the past six months.  She left for Manila yesterday (Monday).  I hope she\\'s happier back home... Mamang, next time you\\'re enjoying a fresh mango shake, I hope you\\'ll think of me!

I checked on Yelp and Gabi came to my rescue!  Based on Gabi's and Karri's reviews, I did not need another referral to fall back on- if Duane was good enough for Gabi, then he was good enough for me!\\n\\nI called Duane on Monday hoping I could have him visit the house that afternoon, but I'd have been happy if he could see me as early as Thursday.  Duane informed me that while he was fully booked that day, he could see \\nme the following day, which meant I'd have to call out of work.  As much as I hate calling out of work unless I'm really sick, I knew that 1.) a leaking tank needed attention or else my house may necessitate lengthier, and costlier, amendments later on should the leakage cause other problems, and 2.) one should never waste water, especially living out here in the desert!  \\n\\nNot only did Duane attend to all the repairs in 90 minutes the next afternoon, but included in that time, he also assisted in choosing a garbage disposal at a nearby Home Depot to replace the one that wouldn't work anymore, despite his assumption that it was nothing more than a stuck penny or broken glass- this has happened once before.  I should add that I had him look into a second toilet tank that a housemate had complained about.  Where a disreputable repairman could have taken this opportunity to charge me for unneeded repairs, Duane revealed to me his honest and trustworthy nature in telling me that the tank d\\nidn't need any repairs done!  He was also more than happy to show me how to do future repairs myself and also offered to walk me through them via phone in the future, should I elect to go that route!  I agree with Gabi and Karri in that his fees are more than fair, and that he is a very amiable and approachable individual.\\n\\nWith so many admirable facets, as well as all-around handyman and social skills, Duane is most definately a diamond!\\n11/30/10\\n\\n2.5 stars.\\n\\nCame for happy hour, but didn't find anything on the happy hour food menu I wanted to try, so I ordered a medium Emilia Romagna pizza (mozzarella, parmesan, and 12-year balsamic vinegar- Aceto Balsamico).  Can't recall what the price was on this pizza, but it was probably around the $14 range.  The pizza came a bit too charred on the bottom, and the very thin-crust didn't stay crispy for very long, perhaps just 5 minutes, and definitely soggy by the 10-minute mark.  While I enjoyed the slice I had at the restaurant, the leftovers\\n proved to be too salty when I tried to re-heat the pizza at home, so I had to toss the rest- not economical for the price, I'm sorry to say.  I only ate a slice at Fred's, bec. I wanted to try the cobbler-of-the-day, which was the apple cobbler topped w/ Haagen-Daaz ice cream (if I recall correctly).  Had to order it sans powdered sugar (corn allergy), and I found it good, and not too sweet.  I'd try their other cobblers, too, if they didn't come at a high cost ($9, plus the ice cream has corn syrup in it- corn allergy).  I'd also like to try the profiteroles, but they, too, come w/ a $9 tag, which means $4.50 per profiterol- I believe I'd asked how many came in a dish and was quoted two...\\n\\nDon't be fooled by the scowl that the bouncer-type bartender constantly has on his face-- he actually was nice to talk to, at least the first time I spoke to him.  A couple of friends and I went there after a mixer about a month ago, and he was unapproachable, and projected himself to be too busy \\nto do more than to come over and take our order.  No hellos and how-are-yous that night- such a big turn-off, and w/ a high-priced menu, I don't think I'll come by again.\\n\\n(I originally was going to rate 3 stars, but type it up as 2.5, but now that I've finished w/ my review, I'm going to go w/ 2 stars.  I wish you better experiences here yourself!)\\n1/07/10\\nMy first visit here was maybe 3 or 4 years ago w/ a friend, and we'd intended to try dinner and perhaps split a pastry.  However, after looking over the dessert display case, we decided to have a pastry tasting party, instead!  My fave pastries that day (and we had sampled 6 or more, maybe 8, different varieties!) were the chocolate-chip studded cannoli and napoleon.  His was, of course, his fave Italian pastry, the sfogliatelle.  I remember it having a lemon cream filling and not enough of it.  But he was happy with it, and that's all that mattered.  \\n\\nFast-forward to last month, I decided to try their stuffed shells, $9, which cam\", 'actual_label': 39, 'predicted_label': 39}, {'text': \"price back to what we thought it was. The full tasting is 4 series of 4 beers. And if you drink them all, you get a t-shirt. James O. and I were sharing, so our server was really nice and let us each have a t-shirt. Very cool. Fair warning: The beers are mostly IPAs, and you should share as, well, that's a lot of f-ing beer.\\n\\nThe frozen shots sounded intriguing to me, so I ordered the Fireball whiskey one. It was not frozen. It was totally room temp in a cold shot glass. Not at all what I was imagining.\\n\\nThe fried sundae was so fabulous. Huge! Get it! It comes with a ton of toppings and you basically create your own fried ice cream sundae. We had a blast with this. 5 stars.\\n\\nOn both visits, the servers were nice, friendly, knowledgeable of the menu, and attentive. \\n\\nAll in all, I'll keep coming back. But I wonder if I can get the Vegas fries Tex Wasabi-style? They are quite better that way.\\nThis is actually a pretty nice Smith's. It's all clean and orderly and things are actually in st\\nock and where they are supposed to be. The produce section is nice. The self-checkout scanners actually work. It's far better than really any other Smith's I've been in. They have a large selection of dessert and pastry items. So hooray for that!\\nIt's a Whole Foods. It seems smaller than some other WF locations, but that could just be my perception and not reality. It has a nice wine and beer section. Good meat and seafood sections. Lots of good produce. And if you need some sort of crazy, over-priced, gluten-free, non-GMO, 100% organic, made by elves in the North Pole whatever whatchamacallit, you can probably find it here. Personally, I just like browsing around here for the random things I hadn't before heard of / haven't seen elsewhere. There are usually plenty of staff at this location, so if you need help, you don't have to look far. And it's conveniently located at The District at Green Valley Ranch.\\nI love the concept of this place. And when it's not a weekend night, it's a fun\\n place to be. On non-weekend nights, it's not too crowded and not too loud. The cocktails pretty much suck. The beer offerings are kinda meh. But you don't come here for the drinks. You come here to play. I particularly like the outdoor area with the giant chess and beer pong areas. It's like a big playground for adults with alcohol. There's no gambling, so it's a nice reprieve from the constant dinging of the slot machines. All in all, I'll consider myself a fan (on non-weekend nights).\\nWe had quite the underwhelming experience here. We were here in the early evening on a Saturday. So perhaps things are better later at night? Decor is nice. Not much in terms of ambiance, though. There was only one server. They do have a happy hour.\\n\\nI wanted to try one of their original cocktails. There are two on the menu, two of which they couldn't make because they were out of ingredients. So I settled on the Green Zombie. Worst. Cocktail. Ever. Really, ever. I tried to drink it and just couldn't e\\nven stomach it. I literally pushed away alcohol. Yet, the world still seems to be standing and hell hasn't froze over? I'll drink bad drinks. But I couldn't handle more than a couple of sips of this one. So terrible. The bathtub jungle juice at bad frat parties is a high-end and good cocktail compared to this one I had. And the server never asked how it was or seemed to care that it went practically untouched.\\n\\nThere is a small food menu. We opted for the teriyaki shrimp. It took about 25 minutes for this one dish to arrive. And we got one napkin and one fork with it, even though there were two of us. It was tasty enough. And again the server never came back to check on us. Now, I would understand if it was crowded or something. But at this point, there was another table of two and another table of three, and that's it. After awhile, we finally managed to flag her down and get our check.\\n\\nI so wanted to like this place - it's got some good reviews. Maybe it was just a bad day and a bad\\n bartender? But we definitely did not have a good experience here. Worst. Cocktail. Ever. EVER.\\nI wasn't quite sure what to expect going in, but we left this show thoroughly entertained. I laughed. I laughed a lot. And it can be hard to make me laugh. I'm also still wondering how he did a lot of those tricks. \\n\\nThis was a perfect afternoon show. The audience participation / interaction was great - and definitely means each show is going to be a bit different. And huge bonus points for Mac sticking around afterward and talking with us.\\n\\nThis is definitely the type of show I can see a broad spectrum of my out-of-town visitors enjoying - from my 30-something single girlfriends to my dad. And that says a lot.\\nI still don't know quite what to think about Rumor yet. It both entices me and turns me off. And it confuses me.\\n\\nFirst of all, I never know where to park here. The valet guys are never out front, half of the parking lot is blocked off, and the spots I can get to are all numbered. Can\", 'actual_label': 40, 'predicted_label': 40}, {'text': ' I park in those spots or not?\\n\\nSecondly, when I enter, no one says a word. There will be at least 4-5 staff standing around doing nothing, but not a single one will say \"Welcome!\" or \"Can I help you with something?\".\\n\\nThirdly, this place kinda feels like a ghost town. Now, of course, I may just have bad timing, but I\\'m pretty much the only non-staffer here every time I go.\\n\\nFourth, what is up with the restaurant? Is it open? When is it open? Does anyone actually work there? And the one time I did manage to get someone\\'s attention (always 4-5 staff standing around and none of them willing to assist a customer) and get seated, they weren\\'t offering the tapas menu and claimed to not have a cocktail menu. Huh? And the service just had an incredible air of rudeness to it.\\n\\nI do, however, like the decor very much. It seems like a place I should love. However, as my husband puts it, they are trying a bit too hard to be like somewhere on the Sunset Strip. And while everything looks neat, it i\\ns all incredibly uncomfortable (bar stools, chairs, etc.).\\n\\nThanks to Yelp Drinks, I did sample a couple of the cocktails here. (Still confused as to how they have 3 cocktails on the Yelp Drinks menu, but don\\'t at all have a cocktail menu?) I tried both the Hollywood and Ginger Lemonade Highball. They were both ok, but I would have felt really ripped off if I had to pay full price. Had the Ginger Lemonade Highball had any kind of a ginger taste to it, it would be an excellent poolside cocktail.\\n\\nI still have another gift certificate to use here, so I will be returning. Hopefully, my next visit will be better than the last couple.\\nI\\'ve been to Ovation twice now - once for a band and once for a musical. Of the lounges I\\'ve been to in other casinos, Ovation is my favorite. It\\'s spacious and open with a modern feel. You definitely don\\'t feel like you are packed in and practically sitting on your neighbor\\'s lap. Plus, I like the crescent-shaped booths. The sound quality is pretty good and t\\nhe cocktail servers are attentive. Definitely a good spot to catch a show.\\nThis place is so bad, it actually becomes awesome. Oh yeah. This out-of-the-way (so far from my side of town) establishment provides some serious people-watching.\\n\\nI got a teeny bit excited when I heard the words \"country\" and \"line dancing\". I may be all J.Crew and Smashing Pumpkins, but I do enjoy a night of country and line dancing once in a great while (and by great while, I do mean like twice a decade).\\n\\nHowever, upon entering (and after paying the $3 entry fee), I didn\\'t hear any country music. Sure, I saw some denim booty shorts, cowboy boots, and cowboy hats, but it all ended there. Nickelback is definitely not country. But hey, I guess it is low-class and redneck, so it worked for this place. Yeah, I just said that.\\n\\nThe place was pretty packed and full of energy. And hey, there\\'s a mirrorball armadillo hanging over the dance floor! After getting a $2 Bud, it was discovered that the best place to saddle\\n up was a table alongside the dance floor.\\n\\nAhh, the dance floor. So much awesome all at once. So many things going on and so many people to ogle. And I don\\'t ogle in the \"he/she is so hot way\". I mean ogle in the \"holy crap, are they really doing that\" way. Yeah. Oh yeah. There was dirrty (yep, two \"r\"s) dancing, solo dancing, woo girl dancing, hook-up dancing, and some serious \"OMG\" dancing. It was quite hilarious.\\n\\nAll in all, I would call this a night of some pretty cheap entertainment. And yes, by entertainment, I do mean people-watching.\\nIt\\'s a Best Buy. It\\'s got all the usual makings of a Best Buy. I do have to say, though, that I have seen this location seemingly improve lately. The store is cleaner and neater. The staff are much more knowledgeable and helpful - and patient. The checkout process is quicker. Finding items is easier. So congrats to this BB for improving over the years. It\\'s not as large as some other Best Buy locations, but it\\'ll get you what you need. Personally\\n, I like ordering online and doing in-store pick-up here. Just don\\'t have a large item without bringing your own personal assistance. The staff here weren\\'t too keen on helping fit a big tv in my car. It was like begging to get a little bit of help. Sure, it\\'s probably not a reasonable expectation or part of their job description or something. But it\\'s just good manners and good customer service.\\nCan\\'t say my stay here was all that great. However, with just visiting as a local, it ain\\'t so bad. So we\\'ll split the difference and go with 3 stars overall.\\n\\nThe amount of parking here verges on absurd. There\\'s a parking garage, plus TONS of parking lot parking all around the property.\\n\\nThe casino itself is nice. Similar to most other off-Strip casinos. Decent gaming options, ok decor, etc.\\n\\nThe restaurants options are a mixed bag. Twin Creeks is fabulous, but I can\\'t say much for the other dining establishments.\\n\\nThe bars are fun, though. The Mermaid Lounge is an awesome twist on your regul', 'actual_label': 40, 'predicted_label': 40}, {'text': \"ar casino bar. Big aquarium with live mermaids! And the other bar, which keeps changing names, has mini-bowling in a trailer (there's an actual term / name for this, but I just don't care to know it).\\n\\nThe standard rooms are ok. They're pretty much on par with a Days Inn (but with a mini-bar). The bed isn't that comfy, but the comforter and pillows are very comfy. The walls and whatnot show their wear. The bathroom is tiny. If you can get the room for cheap, it's not a bad place to stay - just don't expect the type of room you'll find elsewhere in Vegas.\\n\\nAnd I have to mention the fact that the front desk staff neglected to give us a key to the min-bar when we checked in and forgot to mention that a pending charge to cover potential incidentals would show up on the debit card used to check-in. Not huge things, but I've come to expect more from Vegas hotel staff.\\nAnother good Thai spot has come to my neighborhood. Hooray! And they offer delivery too. Extra hooray!\\n\\nThe good:\\n- Nice, cut\\ne, clean, small restaurant with a pleasant enough atmosphere\\n- Pleasant and friendly staff\\n- Good variety of menu options\\n- You can customize the spiciness level\\n- Best miso soup I have ever had - EVER\\n- All the entrees we ordered were delicious - special props to the basil fried rice and orange beef\\n- Everything was packaged nicely\\n- Prices are reasonable and comparable to other area Thai restaurants\\n\\nThe not-so-good:\\n- No website, so no online ordering and no menu\\n- The takeout menu that can be picked up inside the restaurant offers no descriptions of the dishes\\n- They were out of Thai tea when I placed my order\\n- Portions are on the small side\\n- No napkins, utensils, etc. were included with our takeout order\\n\\nAll in all, it's some tasty food. We are certain to patronize again.\\nYum! If you have not ordered from here yet, you should. Really seriously delicious pizza! Fresh toppings, great dough and crust. Good list of toppings. Packaging is done very nicely (they put the lettuce for o\\nur BLT pizza on the side in a baggie so it wouldn't get soggy on the carry-out ride home). Sides are tasty. Prices are pretty decent, especially for what you get. Staff are friendly. Service is speedy. I'm particularly partial to the BLT pizza. I'm getting hungry now...\\nOh Venetian, if only you weren't owned by one of the worst people in politics... Perhaps then I could give you 5 stars. But alas, I refuse. And there are some bad parts, like the sports book, bars, and walk from the parking garage. But the rooms are quite nice (all suites). And the restaurant selection is one of the best in Vegas. Plus, the theme pretty much rules and is done awesomely. This is definitely one of the must-do walk-through casinos.\\nThis is actually not about taxes. I came here for TSA Pre-Check. It was quick and painless. I had an appointment, but had to wait a little bit (less than 10 mins). The front desk staff were very nice and friendly. They offered me water, coffee, etc. while I waited. Once I was ca\\nlled back, it was smooth and fast. I handed over my passport, signed some stuff, did fingerprints, and paid the fee. Just a couple of days later, I had my Known Traveler Number and now I'm all set. So yeah, for TSA purposes, this seems like a good location.\\nThis is a new restaurant in the NYNY. It's right off the Brooklyn Bridge and accessible from the Strip or from inside the NYNY. From the inside, there's a bar area, then a set of glass doors, then a large dining area with a larger bar. From the Strip, there's a really nice patio area, including a bar, then a set of glass doors, then the large dining area, and so on. It's a pretty large space. Rather safe to safe that your wait for a table will never be long as there are just so many tables.\\n\\nThe decor is lots of wood and turquoise and orange colors. It's got a modern, hip, southwest vibe to it. It's neither too bright nor too dark. I really like the outdoor patio area. It's a prime people watching spot.\\n\\nThe beer offerings are signi\\nficant with some good, rare finds. The wine list is pretty extensive too. And the cocktail list is something I definitely want to drink my way through. This is not a good spot if you are feeling indecisive. They definitely offer some unique cocktails. And they're well-made and tasty too. Even if you aren't hungry, come grab a cocktail on the patio. And the cocktails and beers come in a few different size options too.\\n\\nThe food menu is also pretty extensive. Lots of options to choose from. Think slightly upscale-ish comfort food with southwest and asian flavors. Everything I've had so far has been tasty, though, some items have certainly been more crave-worthy than others. But whether you're looking for a full meal or just a snack and drink while you rest your Strip-walking feet, this place will hit the spot.\\n\\nGet the wings! Chicken wings, ducks wings, buffalo sliders. They're all delicious. I love that they're big, meaty, and slathered in sauce. Same goes for the ribs. Good fries. Good\", 'actual_label': 40, 'predicted_label': 40}, {'text': \" mac 'n' cheese. Good lots of things.\\n\\nThey also have a late-night menu and are practically open 24/7 (if there's a few customers, they're open). So if you're hankering for something tasty at 3:00am, this is a good spot.\\n\\nThe staff are all really nice, knowledgable abut the menu, and attentive. All in all, I've had some pleasant snacking and drinking experiences here. And again, the patio / outside area is a great spot to sit.\\nI have a love-hate relationship with this Apple store. Sometimes my shopping experience is a breeze. And sometimes I can't get someone to help me at all. So we'll even it out to 3 stars. I do, however, appreciate the selection at this location - they tend to have most everything I am looking for - from travel converters to Kate Spade cases. And when I do get someone to help me, they are always very nice, knowledgeable, and efficient.\\nI'm a big fan of dive bars and Lucky Joe's definitely fits the bill. It's on the smaller side, always way too dark, almost always f\\neels kind of empty, and the bartenders are always friendly. Plus, there's pool, video poker of course, and a snack machine featuring half chips and half cigarettes. Sure, this isn't a place to go out of your way for to grab a drink at, but it's a great neighborhood hangout. And the beer selection is decent.\\nMy friend and I enjoyed a wonderful dinner here. The service was excellent. The wine list is pretty good. The menu has numerous choices from salads to We both had pasta dishes that were delicious and perfectly prepared. I also loved the homemade truffle potato chips with blue cheese sauce. They're so delicious! Whether for a snack or a full meal, this restaurant in the MGM is a good choice.\\nNote: This review is for drinks only. (The mac 'n' cheese looked crazy good!) I sat at the bar during happy hour. There are some decent food deals. Some drinks specials, but never, of course, their best beer offerings. I paid $11 for a pint! While a good, unique beer, $11 was too too much. And it\\n took over 10 mins for me to be approached by the bartender (though, to her credit, she seemed really busy). And it nearly as much time to get my check. Not cool. (But again, the bar was under-staffed.) The space itself it nice. The beer offerings are good. There are plenty of TVs to watch the game. There's a nice outdoor area. The food looked tasty. But the staff are...underwhelming and unattentive. No one greeted me upon entry or exit. I can't say I've ever had that happen before. But the sour apricot beer was excellent. Though, not sure it was $11 excellent.\\nI don't really actually shop at Bass Pro. But I love walking around, looking at everything, and playing the games at Bass Pro. It's a fun store to just meander about. And they have different shooting games, checkers, etc. that you can play. Plus there's the stream and waterfall with fish, turtles, and ducks, as well as all the stuffed critters all over the store. It's a free/cheap way to spend a couple of hours. And if you do ha\\nppen to be into fishing and/or hunting, you'll find what you need here. All in all, I'm a fan simply because I always have fun walking around and looking at everything here.\\nWhile in Phoenix for work, I ate here more than anywhere else.  Brunch, lunch, happy hour, and dinner.  The food is incredible.  My absolute fav is the wingless buffalo dip - it is so tasty!  The grilled cheese with brie, granny smith apples, and bacon is a close runner-up.  Pretty good beer and wine lists too.  Excellent happy hour deals.  Very friendly staff too and service was always excellent.\\nIt's a Denny's, but a little bit amped up to be more suited for Fremont Street. It's clean and rather pristine. It appears to always be mostly empty. (Why would you eat at a Denny's when there's so much other food to be tried and had?) What this place does have, though, is a bar. So if you're looking for a non-crowded place to grab a drink, this is a decent option.\\nThe City of Las Vegas is amazing in so many ways! But rem\\nember: the Strip is NOT in the City of Las Vegas. \\n\\nI repeat, the Strip is not actually part of Las Vegas. Everything south of the Stratosphere is non-Vegas land. Thus, if all you saw was the airport and the Strip, you never really visited Las Vegas. And that is all the more reason to head north and check out Downtown (or west or east too).\\n\\nVegas, both city proper and the crazy thing that is the non-Vegas Strip, have a unique and interesting history. I am forever fascinated by how the city came into being and all the old timey photographs. Did you Vegas was basically founded by Mormons? Vegas really never gets enough credit for just how neat it is. It goes way beyond boozing and gambling. Hint: Check out the Neon Museum, Old Mormon Fort, and/or Nevada State Museum at Springs Preserve for a glance into Vegas history.\\n\\nVegas pretty much offers it all. It's big city amenities in a suburban neighborhood. And it's a valley surrounded by pretty mountains as a nice bonus. And, of course, the\", 'actual_label': 40, 'predicted_label': 40}, {'text': \"re's the weather. Personally, I like the heat. So to me, Vegas is an awesome place to live as well as visit.\\n\\nAnd seriously, if you are just visiting, take some time to get into the actual City of Las Vegas. You won't be disappointed. There's a whole world beyond the Strip and it's full of awesome things.\\nI've used the RTR website for years now. But I had never bothered with this Vegas store location before. However, when I received an order from RTR that didn't work out, I was able to take it to this store and swap it out for different items. Make an appointment! Without an appointment, you won't really get the proper staff attention and you won't be able to explore all the dresses (they have numerous ones that aren't on the showroom floor). Plus, the staff can then help you add accessories to your outfit. The staffer I had did a great job. She pulled numerous dresses for me and several of them were perfect. It was difficult to settle on just one. She then found some great accessories\\n for it. What I loved most, though, is that the quality of the items here is better than when you order from the website (less used I suppose). I had such a good experience here that I will undoubtedly start using the store as opposed to the website. So when you need something fancy or fun for a night out in Vegas, make an appointment and come here to find a fabulous designer outfit. (Far cheaper and easier than buying something - especially when you probably won't get that many uses out of it.)\\nYeah, I'm giving 4 stars to a freaking Taco Bell. This Taco Bell is so nice and pretty that I feel the need to dress up a bit (wearing pajamas whilst going through the drive-thru here just seems too grungy). It's on the newer side. The staff are some of the best and most professional I've ever seen at a fast food joint. And the service is always friendly, quick, and accurate. So yeah, it kinda earns 4 stars.\\nThis is such a great spot. It's pretty and just far enough away from the Strip. Most ev\\nerywhere within (stores, restaurants, etc.) is dog-friendly, which is awesome. The restaurants aren't superb, but there are several great options. The stores aren't that interesting to me, but it can be fun to window shop. And there are always so many events happening here - free concerts, free movies, wine walks, beerfests, etc. And during the Christmas holidays, they go all out with a big tree, decorations, lights, etc. - even a floating ice skating rink! This is a great place to spend a lazy weekend afternoon just walking around.\\nI love the ambiance of this place. In fact, I love the entire Artisan. The restaurant is quite small, with a stage with a piano, lots of paintings, etc. It's a great little spot. And it is open 24 hours. I've only had the late night menu here, but I was pleased. The food itself is probably actually about 3 stars, but the ambiance bumps it up. Unfortunately, the server we had was brand new, so he didn't know much about the menu, was unable to locate a drink \\n/ wine list, etc. But he was attentive and everything else.\\n\\nFor food, we opted for the nachos and wings. Neither was quite what I was expecting, but, again, I was pleased. The cheese on the nachos was unique in that it was mostly asiago, which gave it an interesting twist. The wings were teriyaki. Not at all spicy, but a good balance of savory and sweet. No dipping sauce comes with it, but we asked for a side of ranch, which was pretty good.\\n\\nOverall, I would give this place 4 stars and would definitely come back.\\nThis Town Square location is an above average place. I waiver between 3 and 4 stars, but will give it the 4. It's got above average prices, but it ain't too bad for what you get. And there are usually some specials or groupons or other things that can help you shave off some cost.\\n\\nThis location is smaller than the Strip/casino versions. It has a much much smaller section for the candy items. But I like that about this place - it keeps it feeling more like a restaurant.\\n\\nThe\\n space itself is pretty and well-appointed. Clean and modern. Very nice. I really like sitting in the booths. They're u-shaped and offer plenty of space. And they're actually pretty comfy. There's also a nice outdoor patio section too. And there's a bar area as well where you can sit and dine.\\n\\nThe service I've experienced here as always been good. Friendly and very attentive. I really appreciate how the servers keep you posted as to the status of your order. And they're always good about letting you know about drink deals and whatnot.\\n\\nThe menu is plentiful. Lots of options. And it's always so hard to choose. Everything from red velvet pancakes to chocolate crepes to burgers to omelettes  to steak to sundaes. Plenty of both sweet and savory options. Plenty of breakfast, lunch, dinner, and dessert options.\\n\\nThe red velvet pancakes (especially with the white chocolate syrup) are quite yummy. I also enjoyed the eggs benedict with salmon and asparagus. And the sundaes are, naturally, pret\", 'actual_label': 40, 'predicted_label': 40}, {'text': 'ty darn awesome. And quite sizable too. The sundae for two could really be a sundae for four.\\n\\nBrunch is a definite good deal here as they do offer all-you-can-drink bloody marys and mimosas. And you literally never even have to ask for another one, as another one will be at your table before you\\'ve even finished the drink you\\'re on. And they\\'ll even bring them to you two at time.\\n\\nAll in all, I\\'m becoming a fan of this place, and will be back again and again.\\nI haven\\'t necessarily been to a lot of surgery centers, but this one is definitely the best I\\'ve been to. \\n\\nWhen you walk in, it\\'s a standard doctor\\'s office waiting room setup. But with more decor and cleaner. The receptionist was very nice. The wait was very short. Hint: Pre-register online and save yourself some additional paperwork when you arrive. And don\\'t forget to bring a photo ID (DL or state ID).\\n\\nOnce you are called back, you are taken by a nurse to a changing area. They take your wait, put compression socks on you, ma\\nke you do a urine sample to test for pregnancy (if you\\'re female), and have you change into a gown.\\n\\nYou are then led to the main room that\\'s a bed area. All one open space, but there are dark curtains that can be drawn about each bed area, which includes a chair for anyone with you. The nurses then do blood pressure, temperature, etc. and set you up with an IV and drugs. Very nice and patient nurses. I was a nervous and nauseous wreck - and they paid me extra attention and never got annoyed by a 30-something being afraid of needles. Big props to nurses Amy and Maureen.\\n\\nWhen it\\'s your time, the anesthesiologist and doctor come talk to you. And then you are wheeled into the operating room. This was a pleasant experience as other surgery centers have made me walk to the operating room, which I always found quite scary and almost panic inducing.\\n\\nPost surgery, you are wheeled back into the same main room. The nurses were right there with me every time I opened my eyes. This also was a lo\\nvely change from every other surgery experience I\\'ve had, whether it be a surgery center or hospital.\\n\\nOnce you\\'re steady enough, the nurses will dress you back in your original clothes. And then lead you out of bed and into a nice comfy chair near the exit door (so you\\'re closer to the car you\\'ll be getting into). And they give you crackers, ginger ale, and water and sit with you. When your ride / caregiver arrives, they spend time going over everything with that person so they are uber prepared to help you out, monitor you, and provide care.\\n\\nAnd then the nurses call you later that same day and the next day to check on you. Very compassionate and caring nurses here. \\n\\nWhile no one ever wants to go through surgery, if you have to have surgery and it\\'s here at this center, you can relax knowing you\\'ll be in good hands.\\nI was pleased with this place (which had nothing to do with the young waitress winking at me as I walked by). And I wish I had been hungrier as the menu was very invitin\\ng.\\n\\nFirst of all, huge props for having HUGE samplers. Seriously, some of the largest beer samplers I have ever had. And there were 7 of them. And secondly, huge props for having good beers. And not your typical beers either. A blueberry pale ale, a barleywine that was light in color with almost a hefe flavor, etc. I was quite happy (or hoppy).\\n\\nAnd then there was the food. I had an extremely difficult time deciding what to order. As per usual, I felt compelled to go with the wings. But these \"wings\" were pork wings, not chicken - and you had the option of jerk or chipolte (I opted for chipolte). The wings came with a cup of beans with bacon and pineapple, which excited me. I also opted for a side of french fries with ranch. \\n\\nThe \"wings\" did not disappoint. They were yummy, saucy pork goodness just falling off the bone. I practically \"oohed\" out loud. I asked for a side of blue cheese, just to taste. Honestly, I should not have bothered. It tasted like icky, watery ranch. However, the\\n ranch that came with the fries was absolutely delectable. It was like ranch with a yummy tang with some garlic. Definitely house-made and quite delicious. And the beans that came with the \"wings\" were heavenly. The bacon and pineapple mixed in made for quite the yummy combo. Thoroughly enjoyable.\\n\\nSo yeah, a pretty great experience. I appreciate the beers and enjoyed the food. The place itself was ok. Definitely glad I got in before the dinner rush. I would definitely opt for a repeat visit should I ever be in the area again.\\nHello Hendertucky! This place is a total dive. And the patrons are, well, interesting. They have karaoke. Combine all of that and you\\'ve got one horribly awesome place. They serve food. The drinks are cheap. There are tables and a bar. There\\'s no separation between the bar and dining area. You can smoke at the bar, but not at a table. It\\'s so terrible, it\\'s awesome. We had a total blast here.\\nFirst off, great showing of customer service by Tom\\'s Urban reaching ou', 'actual_label': 40, 'predicted_label': 40}, {'text': \"t to me after my last visit and encouraging me to come back. And second, I'm so glad I did come back.\\n\\nOn our return visit:\\n- 'A' on the cocktails. Perfectly made and tasty. Tip: Get the bacon bourbon bloody mary.\\n- 'A' on the service. Michael was a wonderful server. Friendly, helpful, attentive, funny, etc. The complete opposite of our last experience.\\n- 'A' on the food. We left full and very pleased with our food decisions.\\n\\nThe mac 'n' cheese pot was superb. Far better than I even remembered from my very first visit. And the green chile was even better. It was spicier and more flavorful. And the macaroni was perfectly cooked and was full of cheesy goodness. This is one of the best mac 'n' cheese dishes in Vegas. It's officially in my top 5.\\n\\nThe buffalo wings were great. They're of average size, but very good quality. Cooked well - not too greasy, not too crispy. Excellent sauce coverage. I just wish they were spicier. But the flavors are good and will please those who aren't super \\nspicy fans. (Unfortunately, the ghost pepper sauce was not available as apparently it's not all that popular. Otherwise, we would've been eating those wings.) We opted for both the blue cheese and green chile ranch dipping sauces. Both were excellent. So all needs in my wings were met - quality, sauciness, and good dipping sauces.\\n\\nThe hangover slopper was huge and delicious. This is the regular slopper, but with a fried egg on top. And a runny egg always makes everything even better. We were actually asked how we wanted our burger cooked this time. And it came out nice and edible. And again, the green chile was even better than before. I practically wanted to lick the plate. It was some seriously delicious green chile. And it's awesomely enjoyed when there's a burger and fried egg involved. This is a tasty dish. And it's definitely big enough to share.\\n\\nAll in all, we had an excellent return visit. This spot is back on the list of my favs. If you're looking for tasty comfort food with\\n a twist in a laid-back, enjoyable environment, Tom's Urban is a wonderful choice. And if you like mac 'n' cheese, wings, and/or green chile, you've got to come here.\\nI'm a total fan of Fatburger. IMHO, it is a superior burger to In-n-Out. Yeah, I said that. And their chilli cheese fries are pretty great too.\\n\\nThis location is on the Strip, near the Hawaiian Marketplace. You'll pretty need to park elsewhere and walk here. There's an inside area and an outside area. Since people-watching on the Strip is a fav pastime of my mine, we opted for outside.\\n\\nThe outside space is a circular bar with bar seating and then several high-tops. It's a seat yourself place. Unlike other Fatburger locations, this one has waitresses. So when you sit outside, a server will come and take your order, bring you your food, and bring you a check.\\n\\nAlso unlike other Fatburger locations, since this one has a bar, you can get beer and mixed drinks. There's also a slushie stand where you can purchase those crazy y\\nard-long tourist concoctions.\\n\\nThe service isn't much, but that's kinda to be expected.\\n\\nThe food, though, is awesome. I thoroughly devoured my delicious burger and all the chilli cheese fries. If you're looking for a good, cheap-ish burger, and want to partake in some excellent people-watching, this is the spot for you.\\nThis is an upscale (expensive) Greek restaurant in the Cosmo. It's all white and modern and nice. There's a small bar area and an outdoor patio overlooking the Strip, in addition to the main dining area. Reservations are strongly recommended. \\n\\nThey do have a prix fixe menu, but they won't automatically give it to you. Our server's face literally fell and grimaced when we asked for the prix fixe menu. Prix fixe = you paying less for your meal. You get about half the portion with the prix fixe menu, but you pay half the price. And it's a great way to be able to experience more menu items. For dinner, it's under $50 a person for 3-courses. For an additional $35 you can a\\ndd a wine pairing (wines by the glass are on the high-end of $$$ here). So we considered the prix fixe with wine pairing a pretty good deal. \\n\\nThere are two options for each prix fixe menu course, so we made sure to each order different items. Again, a great way to experience more of the menu. We had the crab cake, octopus, filet, fish, walnut pie, and baklava. We also ordered a side of tzatziki. \\n\\nI highly recommend getting the side of tzatiki. It's delicious and pairs well with the complimentary bread. The desserts were underwhelming and not worth it. The octopus was our favorite dish and quite delicious. Everything on that plate was wonderful. The crab cake was beautifully presented and tasty. The filet was good perfectly and very tender. The fish was also cooked perfectly, but lacked flavor. The octopus was really the greatest thing we ate here. Everything else was pretty forgettable.\\n\\nWhile we enjoyed our experience here, the food (at least what we had) wasn't worth the price. And\", 'actual_label': 40, 'predicted_label': 40}, {'text': ' our server basically snubbed us once we opted for the prix fixe. The tables next to us (who didn\\'t ask for the prix fixe menu) had entirely different service than us. Not cool.\\n\\nLunch seems like the better option for this spot. I\\'d be willing to come back and try some other options. But more likely, I\\'ll sit at the bar and have some octopus and tzatziki.\\nThis place sure has changed, and so much for the better. At the end of the day, it\\'s not as pretty as the north outlets and there\\'s not as many high-end places as at the north outlets. But it\\'s become a much nicer place to shop. And it\\'s indoors, which is nice when it\\'s a particularly hot summer day. I also like that my favorite store, Banana Republic, is easily accessible from the parking lot. No walking through a maze of a mall required. All in all, it\\'s a closer and easier place to shop (and park at) than the north outlets. Though, it lacks some of the \"luxury\" of the north outlets. But either way, you\\'re gonna score some serious b\\nargains.\\nThis wing spot is tucked away inside a sports bar. It\\'s dark, dive-y, and a bit of a questionable neighborhood. The menu, of course, is all about the wings. You can order chicken wings or pig wings by the lb. One flavor per a lb. There\\'s also some combos, chicken and waffles, pizzas, sides, etc. We opted for 2 lbs. so we could try multiple flavors. We ordered half spicy strawberry cheesecake and half cajun hot. We also got a side of potato salad.\\n\\nThe Wing King server/runner was very nice and brought us our food, utensils, extra plate, etc. The wings were large and meaty. Big points for that. They also had a nice crisp. More points. And they weren\\'t stingy with the sauce. More points. The ranch dipping sauce was nice. The blue cheese dipping lacked flavor and was too runny. The yogurt dipping sauce was super bland and boring. I wasn\\'t a fan of the spicy strawberry cheesecake flavor. The spicy is cinnamon. I was hoping for habanero or something. It was just too sweet and desser\\nt like for me. I don\\'t want my chicken tasting like a cinnamon roll with a hint of strawberry. The cajun hot flavor was great. It tasted similar to Wing Stop\\'s cajun. It was good mix of cajun flavoring and heat. The potato salad was incredibly bland and could\\'ve used any kind of something (pepper, mustard, something).\\n\\nThings I wish they did... List the sauces in order of spiciness/heat. It was quite difficult to determine which hot sauce was the hottest. #1 as hot, hell was like #5. So is hot hotter than hell? I don\\'t think so. Some ranking of the sauces would ease ordering for newbies. And as there are 80 sauce options, picking just 1 or 2 flavors is already a challenge. I also wish you could get 2 flavors per 1 lb. so you could experience more flavors.\\n\\nAll in all, great quality wings, cooked perfectly. And it\\'s great to have so many flavor options. This spot is way far away from us, so not sure how often we\\'ll make it back. But I want to come back and try some other flavors.\\nIt\\'s a\\nn Office Depot. It seems older and smaller than other Depot locations. But it\\'s conveniently located in the Target shopping center. It\\'s nearly always empty. The staff are quite helpful and usually pleasant. And despite being small-ish, they usually have everything you are looking for (plus more). So for all my toner and paper needs, this is where I head.\\nWingstop is absolutely the best chain wings around. By far. Great quality. Excellent sauces. Wonderful ranch and blue cheese. Their fries, potato salad, etc. are also all good.\\n\\nWe ordered a very large order from this location. We used the Wingstop app and it was easy breezy. Our order was ready on time. Was 100% correct. And it was packaged very well.\\n\\nKuddos to the staff here for handling such a large order with little notice and getting everything right.\\nThis isn\\'t the nicest, neatest, or cleanest nail salon. But it\\'s a good one. Appointments are best. They use a hard gel specially created just for this salon. The owner, Han, did a\\n great job on my hard gel manicure. There was absolutely no rush. And my nails look fab. Prices were very reasonable. I\\'ll be back.\\nI have a serious love of Sonic. Those limeades have had my heart for literally decades. And then there\\'s the popcorn chicken, the hot dogs, the shakes, etc. All in all, it\\'s some pretty decent fast food. And the happy hour prices for drinks are a pretty good deal.\\n\\nThis particular Sonic location appears newer and is somewhat hidden depending on which way you are approaching it. The nice thing is that the drive through always moves quickly and is nice and efficient. Yeah, I\\'m a fan.\\nI\\'ve had a restaurant.com gift certificate for this place for nearly year and just now finally got around to using it. I wasn\\'t too excited going in. I\\'ve been to a couple crab places in Maryland and was never that impressed. But it had been awhile and I had the gift certificate - so why not give it a shot and visit the East Coast from Vegas.\\n\\nIt\\'s a small and unassuming restaur', 'actual_label': 40, 'predicted_label': 40}, {'text': 'ant. It has a dive-y feel, but is cutely decorated with crab and Maryland items (ex. Orioles items). You seat yourself. Menus are brought to you. Market prices are posted on the chalkboard behind the counter / cash register.\\n\\nWe were greeted immediately, had the menu explained to us, and our drink order was taken right then. Very friendly and attentive service. Very knowledgeable too - our server had some great recommendations.\\n\\nThe menu is rather extensive and includes non-seafood items too. But, of course, when at Crab Corner, you should get crab - or at least some seafood. They have a small beer and wine list too.\\n\\nAfter ordering, paper for table, utensils, bucket, etc. were brought to us. (No bibs, though.)\\n\\nWe opted for the Maryland crab soup, boardwalk fries topped with crab dip (it\\'s called crabby-style), 1 large blue crab (they have \"regular\" up to \"jumbo\"), and 1 lb of littleneck clams. The blue crab took the longest and items were brought out to us as they were ready.\\n\\nThe so\\nup was unique and tasty. Tomato based with basically shredded crab and veggies. The fries were seriously yum. On their own, they were good fries and perfectly done. But topped with the crab dip just elevated it to a whole other level. Seriously tasty! The clams were yum too. Perfectly cooked in a beer, butter, parsley, etc. broth. And the bread that it came with was great too. And then came the blue crab. Thankfully, we sat ourselves at the table next to the instructions on how to dig into one. And wow, I was blown away. Perfectly done and delicious. WAY better and FAR superior to that famous blue crab restaurant I went to in Annapolis, Maryland. Succulent and so tasty! I was so close to ordering another crab or two (but alas, I had filled up on the goodness of soup, fries, and clams).\\n\\nWe will most definitely be back! Fabulous food and fabulous service. Everything was super fresh and perfectly cooked. Who knew I actually like blue crab?\\nI waiver between 3 and 4 stars. While I know oth\\ners who have grabbed eats from here regularly, thus far, I have only ordered from here once. And therefore, this review is based solely on my one experience.\\n\\nAfter hearing about the Nate Dog, it clearly became what I was jonesing for. As a side, I opted for the sweet dough.\\n\\nThe hot dog was good, it just wasn\\'t great. It\\'s skinny and the toppings are far from plentiful. But the flavor is there and it\\'s cooked well. I think if it had a better quality bun, I would have enjoyed it more.\\n\\nThe sweet dough was yummy, but nothing that left me craving for more. It was just average.\\n\\nI am anxious to try out the tacos and fries, though, so I will definitely be back. And everything else about the experience was great. \\n\\nWhat is really nice is the pricing. The pricing definitely makes me lean more to 4 stars. There\\'s really nothing overpriced about this place, and that\\'s a nice change of pace.\\nAfter reading so many great reviews of this place, and since I was in the neighborhood...\\n\\nIt was basica\\nlly just as I expected, based on the reviews. The decor and atmosphere is fantastic. Long table with outlets for your laptop, books, magazines, games, etc. Huge bonus points for the dog station thingy out front - two water bowls and hooks for the leashes.\\n\\nThe staff / baristas were very friendly. The prices were extremely reasonable.\\n\\nI had an iced peppermint white mocha, which was absolutely delicious.\\n\\nThis is definitely an ideal coffee shop and place where you can chill for several hours.\\nTo me, this a Vegas must-do. Red Rock Canyon, especially at sunset, is an absolutely gorgeous drive. And if you are into hiking, cycling, etc., Red Rock is a great place for that too. And for $7 a day or $20 annually, it\\'s a total bargain.\\n\\nWe aren\\'t the outdoorsy types, but we thoroughly enjoy spending time at Red Rock. There are plenty of easier trails for us to walk. It\\'s a great place to bring our dog too.\\nRemember when Ghostbar was like the coolest place way back when? Now it\\'s practically emp\\nty on a Saturday night. After dining at Alize, we opted to go here. It\\'s free entry with a dining receipt. There were may 15 other people in here. They\\'ve revamped it with different decor and seating. The glass to the bottom thing it different now too. I remember it being one square and looking down to the casino floor (maybe I\\'m recalling it wrong?). Now it\\'s larger and looking down to the front entrance. Not very exciting. The view is nice, of course. It\\'s a great view of the Strip at night. Drinks are still overpriced. All in all, worth a stop-by for the view if you have free entry. I wouldn\\'t pay to come here.\\nThis is a pretty good strip mall nail spot. It\\'s kinda hidden off to the side of the Target shopping center. It\\'s open later most days than other area nail salons. And they appear to be less crowded too. The staff are all very nice. The tech I had did a great job on my gel manicure. The pedicure itself was great, but the polish job was just so-so. What I particularly liked he', 'actual_label': 40, 'predicted_label': 40}, {'text': 're was the no rush state of mind. My pampering here lasted way longer than it has at some upscale spas around town. Overall, I\\'ll be back.\\nThis is a decent little dance shop. However, the selection on most everything isn\\'t that great. The shoes are definitely the main reason to come here. The leotards, tights, etc. are all kind of an after thought - and there\\'s really not a lot to choose from. The staff, though, are very friendly and helpful.\\nI had a great solo dining experience here. There are tons of wines to choose from, including by the glass and flights. The bartenders were attentive, friendly, and knowledgeable. \\n\\nThe menu wasn\\'t exactly my thing - a bit more adventurous than I was feeling. But I had an awesome steak with leeks and potatoes and a great berry tart dessert. \\n\\nDespite staying for awhile when it was rather crowded, I never felt rushed. The ambiance was great. Just the right level of lighting. Wooden, but polished and modern. Just small enough to feel intimate, but la\\nrge enough to accommodate a crowd. It had a nice rustic, classy, not intimidating, upscale feel.\\n\\nThis was a great Charlotte dining experience and I would definitely recommend it.\\nI was envisioning an M&M World type place, but the Hershey store just doesn\\'t quite measure up. There\\'s no free 3D movie or anything. There\\'s fewer floors. And I didn\\'t really see anything unique. I was expecting to find some magical Hershey kiss I\\'d never heard of or something (like the raspberry M&Ms). I was hoping for some free samples. So yeah, it was kind of a letdown.\\n\\nThat said, however, the giant Statue of Liberty and Empire State Building made out of chocolate are neat to see. And there are all kinds of gifts for purchase, like the world\\'s largest Hershey kiss. And the best part, the food counter where you can purchase crazy brownie, cookie, etc. concoctions that are all kinds of chocolate goodness. So it\\'s worth it if you\\'re a chocolate fan or in the area. But it\\'s really just a big gift shop.\\nWhat \\na fantastic little place! I love the fact that it is hidden away - you definitely need to know what you are hunting for. And I love all of the old record albums that line the walls and ceiling as you walk in. It\\'s the perfect tiny pizza eatery.\\n\\nWhat was the best was the pizza. Yelp had built it up so much that I was a bit nervous. But one bite of my slice of cheese pizza and I was instantly transported back to my days at NYU. It was the perfect slice of NY-style pizza. So hot it burned the roof of my mouth. So greasy that I went through way too many napkins. So big I did the fold maneuver.\\n\\nAnd major props for having beer too. Just two handles - Pabst and a Dogfish Head (I didn\\'t see which one). Totally awesome that they have Dogfish Head.\\n\\nAnd big ups for having plastic forks and knives available. For this first try, I had to eat with my hands and be all authentic. But typically, I am a knife and fork girl, so I appreciate it when casual eateries with \"hand food\" also have the proper\\n utensils for those who want them.\\n\\nGreat staff, great food, and great overall vibe (loved the feel, the music, etc.). I will definitely be back,\\nWent back here for the free BRMC shows. First of all, huge props for booking a band like BRMC (and for free and for two nights). While it is a little awkward as it can get very packed and people are trying to stand in between the little table set-ups and the stage is quite small and in a strange location, it\\'s a great experience. (Can a free concert by a good band ever really be a bad thing?) And even with a show going on, the service was excellent. Our cocktail server was very attentive and nice - and handled the extremely large crowd exceptionally well. I\\'m really starting to love this place. Great music, great food, and great drinks - you can\\'t go wrong here.\\nYum! I seriously love me some Raising Cane\\'s. The drive-thru at this location is fast and efficient. And placing a large catering order is quick and easy. Everything we ordered was ea\\nsily transportable and packaged nicely. Tip: Get an extra Cane\\'s sauce with your order - it\\'s delicious to dip the fries in.\\nThis is an alright neighborhood 24/7 bar. It\\'s part of the Remedy\\'s family. Nice decor and ambiance. A little loud, but not obnoxious. Slightly better than average beer offerings. Decent food and a good selection. And they have Big Buck Hunter. All in all, a good place to hang out.\\nPretty much the only good thing about this buffet is the price, assuming you have a 2-for-1 coupon. With those 2-for-1 coupons, it becomes cheaper than a meal at Del Taco. So while Del Taco might be tastier, it costs less here and you, technically, get more.\\n\\nThe salad bar is sad. So sad. Saddest little salad bar that I\\'ve ever seen.\\n\\nThey serve Mountain Dew! This was indeed one of the biggest highlights for me.\\n\\nBesides the Mountain Dew, dessert was my favorite thing. There\\'s a standard vanilla and chocolate dispensing machine and there\\'s several toppings to go with it, including mini', 'actual_label': 40, 'predicted_label': 16}, {'text': 'use I had a meeting to get to.  I followed up again with Harold in the Service dept who promptly went out to the garage and told the maintenance guy to stop working on my car because I had to leave.  He pulled my car around.  I got in the driver\\'s seat and noticed that my car was still saying I was getting 99.9 mpg.  I was PISSED.  The sensor had not been fixed.  I went back inside and said to Harold, \"Did you fix my car?\"  Clearly I caught him off guard.  I said, \"It\\'s still saying I am getting 99.9 mpg.  Why wasn\\'t it fixed?\"  Another service guy came over and said he would reset the sensor from the dashboard.  Oh really?  I turned around to Harold and said, \"No one bothered to check and make sure everything was fixed right before the car was returned to me.\"  He said, \"Well, you said you had to leave.\"  Come on, dude.  You would have let me leave the dealership with a still-faulty sensor and not care one bit.  If he would have said to me around 12:45 that it was going to take a bit \\nlonger than anticipated and that he would give me a loaner car, I wouldn\\'t be as pissed as I am.  Instead, he told his maintenance guy to stop working on my car when I mentioned my time crunch and no one checked to make sure everything was repaired properly.  Complete lack of attention and concern for the customer.  F this place.  You can serve me all the bottled water and coffee and give me a comfy seat to sit in but when it comes down to it, you jerked me around for 3 hours and didn\\'t do what needed to be done on my car.  I won\\'t go back.\\nWow, this place is impressive.  The library is 2 city blocks long.  The business library is one of the top in the country.  And the selection of movies is large, too.  Perhaps most impressive is the staff.  I must have worked with 4 different people and all of them were polite, patient, friendly and very helpful.  A library card gives you access to Clevnet, an online system of a card catalog and searchable database of movies, books, etc.  You can al\\nso put a hold on books and DVDs.  You will receive a letter in the mail when your items are available for pickup.  How cool is that?  Aside from the Metroparks, this is another hidden gem in Cleveland.\\nI have yet to order food here for dine-in or rapid pickup that wasn\\'t 100% accurate. They either forget a salad dressing, leave tomatoes on a sandwich. And employees are very slow.  Such a drag.  An area manager needs to grab a hold of this place and shake it up with some employees who have attention to detail and who care about their jobs.\\nWhat sets Tremont Scoops apart from other ice cream joints is their selection of vegan/vegetarian options ranging from ice cream to desserts.  I\\'d say the ice cream is good, not great.  They also feature a No Sugar Added flavor each day (my favorite is the Country Apple Pie).  They don\\'t charge by the scoop--they charge by weight--which they contend is a fair way to charge a customer.  I kinda agree with that.  Cool charm to this place with benches ou\\ntside.  Nice little find in Tremont.\\nCrazy good.  Extensive menu with a variety of Asian Fusion, sushi, etc.  I could NOT decide among the pork chop, miso black cod and sushi.  I ended up ordering the spicy tuna roll and the beet salad with feta and cumin lemon vinaigrette.  Major WIN.  Service was very attentive from the water to the bread to the entrees.  This place does a great job.  Trendy yet inviting interior.  The Green Hour happy hour is worth considering.\\nYou just gotta have a Peppi\\'s hoagie...especially on your way to a Steelers game.

I appreciated that you could order so many side dishes because I am a light eater.  I settled on the jumbo pierogi (they had 4 flavors to choose from the night we went), cinnamon apple sauce, and smoked kielbasa which came served in a crock with sauerkraut and dumplings.  All were very tasty I have to say.  The boyfriend got the chicken paprikash, tomato soup and finished all of my leftovers.  He thinks the food here is better and more authentic tasting than Sokolowski\\'s (but of course none of it is as good as his grandma\\'s...)  Sokolowski\\'s offers more Americanized choices whereas Babushka\\'s is straight up Polish.  We will definitely go back.

I wasn\\'t clear on them so I ended up disappointed in what clothes they accepted and what they offered me monetarily.  I took in a bunch of Prana pants and dresses, Athleta workout clothes, Big Star jeans, barely worn Converse sneaks, and a Michael Kors dress with the price tag still on it.  The only thing they accepted was the MK dress and they offered me $4 for it.  Sooo....the long and short of it is this...they only want super good condition items that are 1-2 years old, MAX.  It was almost hard to believe considering how many ding dong Nine West handbags they had in the store but my $80 mint condition Prana pants were rejected because they were 3 years old.  So anyway, no sense complaining.  Some things are meant to be sold here, some things are meant to be sold on Ebay, and some things are meant to be donated to Goodwill.  Now that\\n I know their standards of acceptance I will make adjustments to the items I take in to sell and save myself a lot of time and effort!  The store is nicely organized.  Best deals, IMHO, are jackets and jeans.  No such thing as designer sunglasses.  Hit up Nordstrom Rack for those.\\nUniversity Inn gets my vote for BEST PLACE TO EAVESDROP ON ANOTHER TABLE\\'S CONVERSATION.  You will overhear some classic male-female older couple grumbling.  Funny stuff.  Plan to wear your elastic waistband pants to this Cleveland institution of a restaurant.  When you open the door to the place you are instantly greeted by the smell of:  comfort food.  This is a cafeteria-style restaurant that serves up some of the heaviest, butteriest, and tastiest food you\\'ve had in a long time.  The walls are lined with pictures from local superheroes and longtime friends of University Inn.  We went for dinner around 7pm and it wasn\\'t that crowded.  All in all, a very good value.  I had the baked scrod and it came with t\\nwo sides (I chose pierogis and yellow/green wax beans).  And of course the salad bar is included.  I think I heard my arteries slam shut while cutting into my bathed-in-butter baked scrod.  This by no means is a place to go if you are watching your weight but the food seriously is the best comfort food I\\'ve had in years.  The only challenge I have with this place is they\\'ll serve food that\\'s not featured on the menu.  So be sure to check out the food that is being served before you look at the menu.  I get sideways when I get down to the end of the food line and discover sweet potatoes and potato pancakes when I already chose two other side dishes!  Sheesh!  And good luck getting the chalkboard menu to be consistent with the paper menu.  They are never consistent!  But then again, that\\'s the charm of University Inn...\\nHmmm...the lady at the front desk didn\\'t know what kind of bulbs were in the beds.  I asked her to check for me and she acted all inconvenienced by it.  She was more inte\\nrested in talking to the other employee that worked there.  While she was processing my credit card she answered the phone, thus disconnecting the line and causing the transaction to cancel.  She ran it again and once again, the phone rang.  She complained about not being able to understand the caller.  Completely unprofessional.  Their beds are straight out of the 80s.  I normally get spray tanned but after this experience I won\\'t ever go here for that.\\nThe primary reason we went to Nido Italia was to hear the band, \"Disco Inferno\" on a Friday night.  Beware--over the top, white lattice backdrops scream super 80s.  The little white lights in the lattice were completely over the top.  But truth be told, the place was packed.  We were extremely surprised and pleased with the food.  We usually go to La Dolce Vita because we like their sauce, but NIdo serves up a more authentic sauce.  My boyfriend had the meat ravioli and it came bathed in an authentic meat sauce that had bone-in pork in\\n it.  I had the rigatoni with marinara sauce and it was seriously delicious.  And lest we forget about the herb butter that was served with the warm bread.  We will definitely go back, and this may be our new favorite place in Little Italy.  Bravo.\\nThis place is great (not only because I live next door) but because the instructors are terrific.  My favorite class is Thai Vinyasa Flow with Beth Gatchell.  Beth will walk around during class and assist you with getting into a deeper stretch and she\\'ll also perform some Thai stretching moves on you, too.  Her energy and presence are what you would expect from a well-grounded yogi.  Tonight she even played the guitar and led a chant during Shavasana.  Her commitment to the practice and her desire to infuse her own energy and personality into the class make it special.\\nWhen I lived downtown, I made the drive to Rocky River to go to Inner Bliss.

The major winners on the table were the salads, house wood - fired bread and french fries...I have had the fries before so I sold the table on how good they were and everyone gobbled them up.  Nice bar to pop in and have a drink.  Fast and efficient service for a Friday night around 7pm.  Total tab for 3 adults with bevvie and a kid, \\nwith tip, was $120.\\nLots of potential here with a range of offerings for standard fare (omelets) as well as more adventurous fare (kale-aid, anyone?).  I LOVE that they have a varied menu with lots of organic, veg/vegan/gluten free options that are clearly noted on the menu.  They also have protein for carnivores like me!  Chicken, steak and salmon are add-ons.  I went with the seasonal salad with romaine, strawberries, walnuts and goat cheese with griled chicken and balsamic dressing.  Good but I felt it was missing something.  Knowing my palate I was looking for the taste of bacon...ha ha.  Service is great.  Takeout and delivery through Eat Street are available.  A great addition to downtown eats.\\nOkay, all the other reviews are spot on.  Cool atmosphere, mediocre food.  The jalapeno hushpuppies were the best thing on the table but a restaurant should not rest on hushpuppy laurels to keep the doors open.  Pork po boy was disappointing...dry meat, dry/stale bun.  Pimiento cheese dip \\ndidn\\'t have much flavor.  BBQ chips were good but could have used a touch of sweetness.  The biscuits they served when we sat down were dry.  The guy next to us ordered shrimp and grits and the portion was small.  I REALLY wanted to have a great experience here.   But it appears the kitchen is overlooking the little details in the food and for that, I won\\'t go back.  There are too many other great places to eat in Ohio City and Tremont that nail the food every time.\\nJust like its counterpart in Waterloo, Citizen Pie serves up what I consider to be the best-tasting artisanal Pizza in CLE.  You cannot beat the chewy dough, high quality cheese and thick smoked pepperoni.  Yes it is much more spendy than regular pizza places but folks you are paying for quality.  Pizza is made fresh when you order.  Grab a seat at the counter but only do so after walking up and placing your order.\\nMy comments are only about the Cristophe salon...\\n\\nEvery time I am in Vegas I get my eyebrows waxed by Gina . \\n She is the best.  She is the only person I have found who can wax eyebrows with no plucking afterwards.  $30 for an eyebrow without plucking is well worth it in my opinion.\\nGreat experience.  I actually popped in looking for bird food and they didn\\'t have any.  I decided I needed some cat litter so I picked up a box.  The guy working there was very pleasant.  The store is extremely neat and clean.  And the guy even offered to carry the box of cat litter out to my car.  Loved that.  I will go back.\\nCool outdoor patio.  Really random crowd from bikers to preppies...and the menu?  It looks like three chefs with different nationalities couldn\\'t agree on a food theme.  Asian, American, Italian, you name it.  It\\'s on their menu.  The tater tots were very good, actually.  Hand battered and served with a trio of sauces chipotle ketchup and 2 other white sauces--both of which were yummy).  My friend\\'s mussels had a BBQ/spicy flavor to them and she said they were very tasty.\\nAlways great-tastin\\ng food but on this last round of carryout we received a very small portion of ginger chicken relative to the portion size of the pad kee Mao.  Next time I will check my order before I leave.\\nGreat little gastropub.  Food looked and smelled incredible.  I was psyched they had Kentucky Bourbon Ale on draft.  Dark wood interior.  Will go back to eat.  Only downside is the acoustics.  It is VERY LOUD in there.\\nGREAT food and service.  Truly authentic.  Their salsa is spicy so if you don\\'t particularly care for spicy food, ask for the mild green salsa (also delicious).  This is a great off-strip choice.  Reasonably priced, too.\\nWow, this place was a huge surprise.  This is the nicest Asian \"chop shop\" I have ever been to.  I think I counted 16 pedicure chairs.  Spacious layout, an herbal spa bar which is where they grab your custom herbal salts for your manis and pedis.  I got a great Spa Pedicure and a Shellac polish change for a grand total of $68.  Great deal.  Great place.  Very clean, ', 'actual_label': 41, 'predicted_label': 41}, {'text': \"too.\\nLoved the bartop.  I went with the burger for lunch.  It was good, not great.  Yes it is huge and juicy but the burger itself needed to be seasoned.  Bartender was very friendly.  The place draws lots of locals so I will definitely go back and get somehing else off the menu.\\nWOW.  Great food and awesome service.  My boyfriend made reservations and let them know ahead of time we would need to be in and out to make a concert at Blossom.  They were more than accommodating and helped steer us in the direction of what to order/ not order to be in and out within an hour.  The short ribs and mashed sheet potatoes were divine.  My boyfriend's beef tenderloin was delicious and you could have cut it with a spoon.  The beet carpaccio was good, not great.  His wedge salad was awesome.  Wine list is small but has good choices.  The interior decor is very simple, maybe a bit too austere.  But the food more than makes up for it.  Make a reservation.  This place gets busy.  Among all the car deal\\nerships it can be a bit difficult to find so just look for a brick building.  We tipped our server 25%.  Yes, he was that good!\\nI'm not so sure the move into the new space on W. 25th was a good idea for Room Service.  Well, let me re-phrase that.  I preferred the old location AND merchandise assortment when they were located on Detroit Ave.  It seems the new, larger space on W. 25th is much more focused on findables and gifts, not so much clothing and wearables.  The square footage swallows up what little merchandise selection they have.  I walked in and spent about 5 minutes in the store and walked out.  I was very disappointed.  What happened to all the cool Alternative label and Made in the 216 clothing you used to carry?  Bring back the old Room Service format, please!\\nExcellent lunch top to bottom.  The French fries with scallions and rosemary are stupidly good.  I got the farmer's salad with grilled salmon and a maple lime vinaigrette.  Delish.  Service was attentive right down t\\no the water guy.  Cannot wait to go back.\\nI have been to Cibreo many times for private events...but never to have dinner.  I ordered the pasta carbonara which they advised me was not made with egg (not sure how it is still called a carbonara then...). Very rich.  Good.  The Caprese salad was very good.  Service was great...they asked if we were heading to the theater to manage our experience which we appreciated very much.  My boyfriend got the chicken parm.  Huge portion and it was very good.  The meatballs were on the cold side...bummer.  But overall, a very nice dinner.  I still prefer the small, intimate experience and food quality of Mama Catena in Euclid over a place the size of Cibreo.  But if you need a moderately priced Italian place and don't want to shell out the dimes to eat at Chinato, go here.\\nReally?  You charge customers a $1 surcharge for paying with a credit card?  Beat it.  I will buy my liquor elsewhere.\\nI give this place a SOLID 4 stars for the level of creativity \\nwith their cakes.  It looks like they've competed in many Food Network challenges so the possibilities are endless for whatever kind of cake you want.  I stopped in to check out the cupcakes.  As many of you know, I've been on a quest to find the best cupcake in Cleveland so this review is for the cupcakes only.  I picked up a Cookies N Cream, Trip Chocolate, Red Velvet, and Carrot cake.  While they were impressively decorated, the cupcakes didn't have any filling inside of them.  Of more disappointment was they weren't very moist.  The price was right ($2.50 per cupcake) but I still vote A Cookie and a Cupcake as best cupcake in Cleveland.\\nKinda old school, kinda 70s.  Watch your head if you sit at the table near the window--the blinds are so low they WILL conk you in the head!  Love the brown - colored mugs that remind you of drinking coffee at Perkins with your grandparents.  Loved the muffled sound of the Doobie Brothers playing over the speakers.  Went with the bacon, cheese, onio\\nn and green pepper omelette.  Very good.  Breakfast potatoes are great.  My man liked his apple cinnamon pancakes very much (and of course I had to taste them to make sure they were fresh...)  Service was friendly and fast.  The table behind us raved about their lemon ricotta pancakes.  Parking is a pain.  Pick a meter and feed it with quarters.\\nAfter receiving the worst haircut of my life at a dum dum salon in Canton, I randomly googled salons in Cleveland and came across Danny's Salon.  I read the bios of the top stylists and decided that these folks were on par talent-wise with some stylists I used to go to in San Francisco.  I called and spoke to the receptionist and told her I wanted someone who was a master stylist who is well-versed at point cutting.  She immediately recommended Theresa.  She said Theresa is a salon educator and she's been cutting hair for 15 years.  I wanted to be relieved but until you physically get to a salon and talk to the stylist, it's really a crap shoot\", 'actual_label': 41, 'predicted_label': 41}, {'text': \" in my humble opinion.  I arrived at the salon and it's really nothing fancy.  It's located in the first floor of an office building.  It's a Paul Mitchell salon, and I cannot remember the last time I was ever in a Paul Mitchell salon...anyway...Theresa greeted me and we went to her station.  I told her my nightmare story and reluctantly took my hair out of my ponytail to show her how bad of a cut it was...I showed her a few pictures and away we went.  I instantly felt comfortable with her and her knowledge of hair texture and styles.  Whew...long story short...we had a great conversation and she gave me a terrific and technically perfect haircut that exactly mirrored the picture I showed her.  She is meticulous about checking her angles, and I love that in a stylist.  It shows their professional training and desire to do a good job.  I wanted to jump out of the chair and hug her!  I will definitely go back to her.  A haircut with her costs $52.\\nWent in here to look at kittens, and I e\\nnded up adopting two of them. Compared to other adoption centers, I wouldn't say the APL is very clean. The kitten room smelled very bad, and only when i pointed out to one of the volunteers that one of the kittens that I was considering adopting had diarrhea, did they do anything about it.  And then the Vet tech cams in to examine the kitten. I asked them to provide me with Medicine for the kitten and they did.  I wish they would be more vigilant here and notice these types of things. That was disappointing. But I have Given them a rockstar home and vet care so they ended up in the right hands.  Sherelle at the front desk was very helpful. I was able to put a paid hold on the kittens and think about it overnight. A pretty good experience, but damn I wish this place were cleaner, and that they would be more observant of potential health issues with the animals.\\nMichelle is awesome.  She skillfully applies extensions to each lash, using Mynkies lashes. She uses a strong glue so the lash\\nes have staying power.  Compared to other lash extensions I have gotten in the past, the Mynkies are the best.  Her pricing is very good, and it is easy to book online.  I just wish she would wear gloves.\\nShame on the women who work here.  They never acknowledged me and instead carried on the conversation between them.  At that point I decided I didn't need bakeware that badly and left the store.\\nOutstanding top to bottom.  The atmosphere, with the restored ceiling and intricate paintings and larger-than-life space is awe inspiring.  The beet salad and deviled eggs were downright delicious.  And the Creme brûlée with a sidecar of Madelines was so, so yummy.  Service was professional and attentive.  A winner.  Too bad my date was a total boob...\\nUpdate:  cupcakes are now $3.00 apiece.  I went in to re-taste the the cupcakes because now I am shopping for a wedding cake.  Well, I about passed out when they quoted me their pricing.  Relative to other bakeries I have spoken with in the Clev\\neland area,  White Flower quoted $6 a serving for buttercream and $10 a serving for fondant.  WHAT?!?!  Other bakeries start at $3.50 for buttercream but I don't know their fondant pricing.  Like I have said before...the cupcakes are 'good'...and the cake is the same as the wedding cake...so the $64,000 question is...am I willing to pay that much for a 'good' cake?  Probably not.  I will go down swinging and saying that A Cookie and a Cupcake in Tremont is the cat's ass when it comes to cakes and cupcakes.  I have ordered many cakes from them and everyone always comments on how killer delicious they are.  I am starting to think that it's not worth trying to find someone better than them--taste-wise and price-wise.  If it ain't broke don't fix it, right?\\nI was in town for an interview and didn't pay for my room, but the corporate rate they got was $97.  Pretty awesome.  Self parking (I think) was $8 per day.  Cheap!  This is what you expect from a Westin--that heavenly scent, Heavenly b\\ned with soft sheets, and Heavenly bath towels.   This particular Westin uses an energy-saving program.  They'll tell you to insert your key card when you get in the door of your room because it powers the lights and AC.  I'm not a fan of that so I request two keys--I insert one and keep the AC running while I am out of the room and use the other key to get into the room.  Sorry, but I'm not returning to a hot hotel room and waiting for it to cool down!  \\n\\nI was disappointed to see they didn't offer complimentary bottled water in the SPG rooms...I guess the reality of the economy is hitting them and they are cutting back on that.  Bummer.\\nCool little joint.  I recommend sitting in the back.  The servers pool their tips so expect to encounter a few different waitstaff during your dining experience.  I opted for the Mazorcada and the boyfriend opted for the Chorizo arepa.  My Mazorcada was heavy-handed on garlic.  And wow, it's rich.  But good.  The Chorizo arepa was good.  The tortilla c\", 'actual_label': 41, 'predicted_label': 41}, {'text': 'hips are nicely seasoned but dare I say not as good as the ones Antonio makes up the street at El Tango Taqueria.  The black bean soup was disappointing...tasted weird.  The house-made sauces are good.  By far I thought the spicy peanut sauce (which tasted nothing like peanut) was the best.  Lots of hot sauce in that baby.  BYOB.\\nEh, very mediocre.  I bet this place is surviving on Chipotle\\'s e coli debacle right now.  The chicken is chunk chicken so I ate around it once I saw it.  Salsa Fresca in Rocky River gets this right by fresh grilling their chicken, which I prefer because that is the way chicken comes.  With the exception of the salsa verde (green), all of the salsas need some help.  The corn is canned corn.  The Pico is completely flavorless.  The upside of this place?  You can order a smaller size burrito.  But that isn\\'t enough for me.  The quality isn\\'t there.  Sorry.\\nGood not great pizza.  Definitely better than Papa John\\'s and Pizza Hut.  I like their crust the best--chew\\ny and thick.  We always ask for extra sauce but they skimp on it.  I\\'d give it 3.5 stars if I could.\\nFinally went here. We made a reservation for dinner.  Cool atmosphere with a broad age range of dining patrons.  It can get a little loud in there at times, and given that the tables are situated pretty close together, don\\'t even try and have a quiet conversation.  Service was attentive.  The house-made loaf of bread with the oil/balsamic is ridiculously good. I could have easily eaten 4 loaves of that.  I went with whatever side salad is listed first on the menu and served with Sweet n sour dressing. Another winner. Delicious mix of flavors in that salad.  So, the entreé...I went with the browned butter sage gnocchi...and cue the disappointing music...The gnocchi was way overcooked and gummy.  The browned butter/sage sauce had more citrus notes to it and it was sweet.  The pine nuts couldn\\'t save it.  Perhaps I ordered the wrong thing, but what really creases me is the restaurant bills\\n itself as an Italian restaurant so how in the world can you overlook your gnocchi?  The husband got the Carbonara.  I think it was under salted.  It wasn\\'t the best carbonara I have tasted but it was respectable. The best Carbonara is at Dante, hands down.  I don\\'t know if I will go back to M. I really want to say I will.  Perhaps I need to read other reviews and choose a different entree next time.\\nAesthetically this is a nice dealership...but I don\\'t like the way they do business.  They say, \"We don\\'t discount prices.\"  But then a salesperson said to me, \"But since I think you\\'re a nice person I\\'ll give you $1,000 off.\"  \\n\\nRiiiiiiiiight...don\\'t insult my intelligence.  I\\'m happy to take my business to another Audi dealership who will put together a better deal and isn\\'t so arrogant.\\nI seriously think we were the only people staying in this hotel Labor Day weekend.  The inside of the hotel looks like the Titanic.  I seriously felt like I was on a movie set.  Anyway, our room (#405) w\\nas huge.  Everything was in the working order but the beds didn\\'t seem like the high-grade Hyatt Sweet Sleeper beds I\\'ve slept in before.  Hmph.  Unless this place books a lot of conventions and weddings, I don\\'t know how it will stay in business.  And prices at their coffee bar (Starbucks) were ridiculous.  I normally pay $2.10 for a Venti iced tea and they charged $2.50 for the same size.\\nJillian and Tricia have put together a great box.  Warning:  it may be a little difficult to find!  Birdtown is located in a warehouse building on the 3rd floor.  Luckily I found someone in the parking lot to lead me to it.  I never would have found it myself.  The box is nice space with all the bells and whistles--Rogue equipment.  Old-school style with a whiteboard on the wall to record your day\\'s WOD performance.  Great coaching and encouragement on technique.\\n\\nGreat vibe here.  Lots of ability levels ranging from super athletes to everyday folks getting in shape.  Friendly people who will introd\\nuce themselves to you and get to know you.\\nGreat cozy, intimate Italian restaurant.  Updated decor unlike some places on the street in need of a major update.  I love that it is not a zoo/factory in here.  Good variety of food.  Started with the dinner salad..nothing more than a pile of mixed greens.  Balsamic vinaigrette was good.  I went with the Orechiette with sausage and the man of the house went with spaghetti.  Both dishes were good but I felt like the sauce was missing something...garlic perhaps? Just a little dull.  Sausage was yummy in my tummy.  Great all-Italian wine list with Sangiovese for $5 a glass.  Score.  Chef Valerio is visible in the dining room when he comes out to greet many regular diners.  Bartender was also our waitress.  Very friendly and good service.  She said Valerio makes a family meal for the staff each night.  Very cool.  Nice spot for a quiet dinner with occasional live acoustic music from a 1-man band.\\nNo frills.

And let me tell you...after having eaten my way up through Little Italy, this place has the best marinara sauce.  Period.  Lately I have been on a stuffed rigatoni kick here.  So killer good.  The server said the filet mignon is good so maybe next time I will break stride and order that.m\\nJoe's is my new fave place in the West 'burbs.  Craving a great chicken sandwich like a bacon and Swiss on a deliciously seasoned piece of chicken?  Go to Joe's.  Want to receive great, friendly service?  Go to Joe's.  Want to eat a corned beef sandwich wrapped in potato latkes that puts Slyman's to shame?  Go to Joe's.  And don't you dare overlook the dessert menu.  Yummo.  This place is an upscale deli/family restaurant that gets it right every time.\\nRarely do I write reviews about hospitals but I gotta give credit where cr\\nedit is due.  This was the friendliest most efficient ER experience I have ever had.  The nurses, doctors and specialists were excellent.\\nAh, so this is the name of this pizza joint.  We saw people mowing down large slices of pie and so we asked them where they came from and voila...they pointed down a hallway and this pizza joint magically appeared.  Really good slices (and I say that after boozing at the pool all day).  I have no idea what time this place closes but I have to imagine the drunks pour in here late night/early morning.  Get the thin slices and not the thick Sicilian style slice.  If they have a slice of pepperoni and sausage, tuck into it.\\nWent in to buy a new pair of glasses.  I had to order them so I had to wait 5-7 days for them.  When I got home and looked over the itemized receipt, I noticed I had been charged $34.99 for a 1-year protection plan.  Huh?  I never asked for this and the salesperson never discussed it with me.  So I decided on the day I would go pick u\\np my glasses that I would ask about the charge.  In the meantime, I went online and found my exact same glasses (Prada frames) and high index lenses being sold for $80 less on the Frames Direct web site.  LC called me and said my glasses were ready.  So I took the receipt showing the charge for the protection plan and the competitive price from Frames Direct hoping for a credit on the protection plan and a price match. When I asked why I was charged for the protection plan the girl only explained what the plan is...she did not explain WHY I was charged for it.  I told her I never asked for it nor was it ever discussed at the time of purchase.  Then I asked her if LC would match the price (and essentially save me $80 off a $600 pair of glasses.). She got shitty and said LC does not match competitive prices, and that she doubted those were authentic Prada frames.  And then she snidely asked if they came with authenticity papers.  At that point I was pissed.  She had such an attitude.  So\\n I slid my credit card across the table and said I wanted to return the glasses (I hadn't even seen how they turned out) but the principle of how she treated me pissed me off so badly.  I will never buy another pair of glasses from there and I will find another optometrist as well.  That was a shady thing they did sneaking in that  protection plan charge and then giving me attitude over the competitive price match request.  Had the girl politely answered the question instead of getting shitty I probably would have accepted the fact they don't price match and walked out with the glasses.\\nHuge beer list.  The only thing that drives me nuts about this place is its open seating.  You are forced to hovercraft over people, waiting for an open bar stool or table.  The really bad part is you sit down to a dirty table and it may take a while for the busser to clear off the table.  Enough of the annoyances...Pizza was pretty darn good and more than enough for 2 hungry people to share.  Service w\\nas good once we got settled, and we were there on a busy Saturday night.  A good place to go for a few pops or before a concert at Jacobs Pavilion.  I imagine it would be a good place to watch a game.\\nOne of the better Dave's locations in terms of speed of service and order accuracy.  The bummer?  Where is the cute kids' menu that is at all other Dave's locations?  It is not on a board...only on a printed menu.  Same rock n roll vibe as other locations.\\nSo, I thought the food was average. But what makes this place is the cool interior and super attentive and friendly bartenders and servers.  We felt like we were part of la familia. I haven't felt that way in a Mexican restaurant, probably ever.  Fajitas did not arrive sizzling. Bummer.  My bean burrito and cheese enchilada were standard fare. Nothing to shout about. The beer was extra cold so bueno for that.  Very clean restaurant.\\nVery good and authentic food.  You won't hear a lick of English spoken here...todo en Espanol.  The pupus\", 'actual_label': 41, 'predicted_label': 41}, {'text': 'as are delicious, and at $1.60 a shot, you can eat like a king for pennies on the dollar.  Steak tacos are okay (much prefer the ones at La Plaza Supermarket).  The platter with eggs, beans, fried platanos and a chicken tamale was delicious.  Now, for the chink in the armour...this place is filthy.  Many tables had dirty dishes on them and the bathroom was disgusting.  Just because the place is small and ethnic does not mean it has special license to be un-hygienic.

The chili was downright nasty--bland and super greasy.  The burger was tasteless.  And the service was slow.  Wait, I almost forgot to mention the greasy Italian dressing for the salad.  I\\'ll stick to having beer at this place.\\nLove the atmosphere.  The iced latte was good--- a little too much milk relative to coffee.  Very friendly staff.  The muffins, scones (sweet and s\\navory) and cupcakes in the case look amazingly delicious!  Parking is limited out front.\\nI am currently a member at Cleveland State Rec Center and was a member at Lifetime Fitness until I joined this Fitworks.  This place is a GREAT value in my opinion.  But I guess one\\'s perspective depends on one\\'s needs.  I was looking for a gym close to my house that has cardio equipment (specifically a Stairclimber), multiple TRX straps, BOSU balls, and free weights in some 2lb and 5lb increments.  I got all of this plus Spinning and group training classes (which are not really important to me because I spin at Cyclebar), a locker room with a sauna, and a comfortably air-conditioned gym.  Quite a steal for $25 per month compared to $92 per month at Lifetime where the classes are not that great and unless you take advantage of child care, basketball courts, their pool, etc why pay for stuff you don\\'t need?  I loved how nice Lifetime was but for the price...nah.  Is Fitworks nicer than Cleveland Sta\\nte?  No.  But as a supplemental gym it meets my needs.  Some of the equipment in the back is old and they don\\'t have foam rollers, kettlebells or battle ropes on the floor...bummer...but This place is WAY nicer than Anytime Fitness on Mayfield Rd and costs less.  Like I said, a great value and it works for me.\\nMy newest obsession at Joe\\'s is the Grilled chicken salad with hot bacon dressing.  OMG.  Tasty, HUGE portion which I never finish and take home for another meal.  Great food as always and bar service is always attentive.\\nDon\\'t like this place.  The layout is completely weird and borderline uncomfortable.  The bar is cramped.  Pretty good-sized beer list but not to the level of a Winking Lizard.  Won\\'t go back\\nAnother outstanding experience.  This time we sat at the Chef\\'s table which is actually a long bar alongside the open kitchen.  Watch everything be prepared and plated in front of you.  Chef Schimoler even brought us a chef\\'s tasting of an heirloom tomato with fresh mozzare\\nlla and a drizzle of balsamic vinegar.  Fresh and delicious!  The new scallops appetizer seems to be the most popular right now.  The Balsamic popcorn is incredible...I just wish they would remove the damn unpopped kernels!  The special was walleye and flicking awesome.  I went with the usual stuff I order...deviled eggs and beet salad.  We even got a tour of the basement from Sous Chef David which was really neat to see the vault and the prep kitchen.  Always a first class experience at Crop.\\nGood bread on sandwiches.  But I was a little salty when I asked for a sandwich without tomato and the woman reached for a pre-made sandwich, removed the tomato, and handed it to me.  Had I not been there with another person I would have made a federal case out of her doing that.  Mac and cheese is pretty good.  Aside from the deli there is a nice selection of Italian foods.  If I don\\'t want take the drive to Gallucci\\'s this place fits the bill...only they don\\'t sell pizza dough.\\nGreat return vis\\nit with a group.  Service from Suzanne was terrific.  Everything on the table was delicious...poutine, kebabs, burgers, oyster po boy, hanger steak, pomme frites, Chai creme brûlée, s\\'mores dessert, and chocolate raspberry ice cream.  And I didn\\'t even mention their great beer list.  The Dark Horse Plead the 5th Stout is delish.  Make a reservation. It fills up on weekends.  Always a great call.\\nOk, seriously, their glazed donuts might be the best thing I have ever tasted in the donut category. Krispy Kreme eat your heart out (RIP). Becker\\'s makes a KILLER glazed donut.  I found the other donuts to be good but not as standout.\\nFINALLY!  A place that reminds me of Rubio\\'s in California.  Got the \"say cheese\" burrito with grilled chicken.  Very good.  The queso inside it made it.  Next time I need to try the grilled Mahi tacos or the barbacoa.

My pear salad with grilled chicken was very good.  The boyfriend\\'s seaweed salad was good but he said he\\'s had better sushi at other places.  Service was attentive.  Perhaps my fave part of the meal was the bread they brought to the table...the multigrain bread (with a slightly sweet butter) was killer good.  I was shocked when she said it was Orlando bread.  Huge outdoor dining area and bar.  Great weeknight specials like Date Night Wednesday menu for $40.\\nDios mio...This place is awes\\nome.  My boss came into work raving about the salsas and guacamole she bought here.  Being a sucker for good Mex, I had to make the trip to La Plaza.  The store isn\\'t nice by any means but here comes the good part:  Robert.  Robert is the \"front man\" of the freshly prepared foods.  He gregariously introduced himself to me, plated up some yummy mole and pork chile and invited me to try the food.  Well, it was delicious.  I wanted one of everything.  He said they go to Chicago on Thursdays so the best days to visit La Plaza are Friday, Saturday, and Sundays.  They even sell El Milagro tortillas.  When I lived in Chicago I religiously bought these--they are the best.  When you stop in, meet Robert.  Super great guy and he\\'ll give you a behind-the-ropes experience at La Plaza.  One word:  TACOS!  The taco cart outside is a MUST DO.  Double-layered, warm corn tortillas, fresh cilantro, fresh onion, and any meat from chicken, barbacoa, carnitas, carne asada, and some veggie mix.  Downright d\\nelicious.  Any only $2 per taco.  And with their house made salsa.  My gosh I need to stop talking about it.  I am going to go again tomorrow!\\nHad a wedding cake consultation with Lauren.  She is nothing short of impressive.  I got to learn a little bit about her...she has a background in Industrial Design.  She is self-taught in cakes.  She designs some of the most amazing-looking cakes you will see in the window of the shop.  I think their white cake is the best I have tasted.  The wedding cake tasting costs $25...but it includes generously sized portions of chocolate, white, yellow, marble, and red velvet cake, all with vanilla buttercream.  Then I got to choose a variety of frostings and fillings I helped myself to chocolate ganache, chocolate buttercream, vanilla custard, raspberry filling, espresso, and I am forgetting one.  Rolled myself out of there.  White Flower IS expensive.  But damn, that white cake with vanilla buttercream is outrageously good.  The *only* downside is the\\ny won\\'t design a cake that combines buttercream AND fondant.  Reason being is their buttercream is 100% butter-based and HAS to be refrigerated, and fondant cannot be refrigerated.  So you have to choose one or the other for a wedding cake.  I was bummed because the design we wanted combined both.  The sky is the limit with cake designs here but you WILL pay exorbitant prices for them.  Granted, the design I wanted was super labor-intense and I was quoted $15.00 per serving (and a serving is 1.5\" by 1.5\").  Yikes.  So if you are prepared to drop mega bucks on a cake, this is the place for you.  I just want a cake that combines buttercream and fondant so I need to find a bakery that has a shortening-based buttercream so it can be left unrefrigerated.\\nI\\'d say OCB is a step down from Chipotle and I am not a fan of Chipotle.  I will take an authentic Mexican burrito join any day.  I actually thought the taste was a bit bland and lacked character.  I could re-create that exact same burrito \\ntaste in my kitchen.  Small menu but if it\\'s a burrito you\\'re seeking, you\\'ll find it.  I love the baby burrito--a 6\" flour tortilla with beans, cheese and salsa for $1.85.  It\\'s probably the best value on the menu.  Their blue and red corn tortilla chips are good, and I am a fan of the Red salsa which is a hot salsa.\\nGreat hotel.  I have stayed here quite a few times in the last few weeks because it\\'s linked by Skybridge to the Cleveland Clinic.  The service at this hotel is great--valet, front desk, housekeeping, etc.  I\\'ve only stayed in corner suites (939 and 639) and both were spacious with a separate sitting room.  The beds are very comfortable, and the bathrooms have separate showers and bathtubs.  I will definitely stay here again.\\nMy new favorite place to buy clothes and cool gifts.  The items have an edge to them--just my speed.  The store features a lot of locally made items--yeah, I know, hard to believe some cool shit is actually made in Cleveland.  The way the stuff is me', 'actual_label': 41, 'predicted_label': 41}, {'text': 'rchandised is well thought out and straight up cool.  Reminds me of little boutiques I used to frequent in Chicago.\\nWent here to have a new car stereo installed.  Their prices were reasonable and the installation only took 45 minutes.  When I got into the car I noticed there was no sound coming out of the left speakers.  Someone from the shop came out immediately and asked if anything was wrong.  I told them the problem and they immediately took my car back into the shop.  Within minutes they had sound coming out of my left speakers.  Good, honest work here.  Very happy.\\nPlastic cups?  Really?  Do I look like I am about to wile out and go nuts or something?  Thus place is stuck in the college years.  Although... The wings and a cold Summer Shandy on tap while sitting on their back patio never suck...\\nLoved this place.  Aside from the huge menu, I was instantly transported back to being in Berkeley, CA based on the decor and the menu.  I ordered the AD which was tuna on pita with falafe\\nl, cheese, and tomatoes.  So yummy.  The pita was thin and delicious.  There is a good selection of vegan/vegetarian options, and the milkshakes seem to be a popular item among patrons.  This place gets busy for lunch so if you don\\'t want to wait for a table, opt to sit at the counter.  Fast service.  Cool, independently-run vibe.\\nFood sucks.  Had the short rib sandwich and it was all flabby fat and gristle.  Service on outdoor patio was slow.  Why go back?\\nI am just going to come right out and say it...Banana Blossom rivals Ty Fun.  We had a great experience.  The potstickers are probably the best I have had and I consider myself a potsticker snob.  They are clearly hand rolled.  And let\\'s talk about the toasted minced garlic on top of them.  On to the wine list...very respectable!  I ordered the Pad Se Ew and the boyfriend ordered the Chicken Cashew Nut.  Both were terrific.  Let\\'s talk about the service...we had a reservation at 7:30pm and proceeded to talk and sip wine for an hour.\\n  The server completely respected that--how refreshing.  I love this place and we will be back many, many times.  Bravo!\\nGreat find in the cute little downtown area of Medina.  You walk up to the counter, peruse the quite extensive menu for a little cafe, and place your order.  They\\'ll bring the food out to you.  The decor is a bit spartan but what really made me smile was the collection of old cookbooks in the bookcase.  I checked out a few recipes from Germany, Italy, the West, and Mexico.  It took me back because it reminded me of the old Grand Diplome cookbook collection my Mom used to keep on top of the refrigerator...anyway, I digress...I ordered the Falafel wrap and a side salad.  I have been on a hunt for good Middle Eastern food so I figured what the hell, right?  Well, it was very good.  It was perfectly spiced and refreshing at the same time.  It was obvious who ever was behind that recipe knew Middle Eastern flavors well.  After I finished eating I complimented the girl beh\\nind the desk and she told me the chef\\'s wife is actually Lebanese.  Bingo.  That explains it!  Large portions, good prices, and a cozy little fireplace.  I\\'ll definitely go back.\\nGreat food experience.  Prime filets were awesome and I could have cut it with a spoon.  The Caesar salad was the best I have had in years.  Green beans as a side dish are killer good.  Wine selection is very good with lots of domestic and import selections at various price points.  Doughnuts were universally liked by everyone at the table but I didn\\'t try them because I was too stuffed from my blue-cheese crusted filet with Bernaise sauce.  Yeah, my pants were tight after that meal.  \\n\\nService could be improved...and this includes the girls at the front hostess area.  One of them saw us walk in and she let the door close in front of us.  Um, okay.  Our server was very slow to greet our table. ..we waited probably 15-20 minutes before someone greeted us and took our drink order.  Dinner for 2...$300.\\nMy my my.\\n..the closest thing you will find to Wegman\\'s.  I drive 15 minutes to get here when I have 3 grocery stores within 5 minutes of my house.  Market District rocks.  Selection is incredible.  What really surprised me was their in-house made pizza.  Wow, super good stuff.  I end up spending at least 90 minutes in this store because I either discover new items that other stores don\\'t carry or because I have too many glasses of wine while shopping (kidding).  Run up a big grocery bill and then use your Fuel Perks to fill up your gas tank at the Get Go in the parking lot.  Win win.  Boomsies.\\nPerfect place for a business lunch meeting.  What separates the men from the boys in great restaurants is when you are offered a black napkin in lieu of the white napkin when you are wearing a dark outfit.  It amazes me how many alleged \"great\" restaurants miss this.  Not Giovanni\\'s.  Very quiet atmosphere so it was great for a private discussion.  Our server was simply outstanding, very experienced and ', 'actual_label': 41, 'predicted_label': 41}, {'text': \"and could tell that nothing was going to compare to the other dress. So, sadly, I didn't end up buying a dress here, but I would recommend checking them out, especially if you are on a budget.\\nI was expecting not to like Nishikawa. I went in to my visit with some negative feelings. The first time I came to visit, they were supposed to be open, but they weren't. To put this in perspective, I drove 60 miles roundtrip for nothing. I was not thrilled. \\n\\n\\nNeedless to say, I waited awhile and made sure to call before making a return visit. Even then, their hours were crazy... I had planned to go one day, called, only to find they were closed again. \\n\\nSo fast forward to my actual visit. I called to verify they were open. I drove over and was pleasantly surprised by their cute little shop. I tried the gyoza... very good. They are clearly made in house and came out hot, crispy, and delicious. I ordered the tonkotsu and asked for it spicy. The ramen was legit. The broth was tasty with a good amo\\nunt of heat. It had kikurage mushroom in it, which I really like. The meat was a thick slice that was perfectly tender. Overall, the ramen was worth coming back for.....would be a solid 4 star if their hours were more consistent.\\nI have to give this place props for having XLB.... I always appreciate that.... and they were tasty, but I have had better in the valley. I came here with a friend and we shared the XLB, potstickers, scallion pancake, and beef pie. The XLB were the best item, juicy and tasty. The potstickers were good, but they had a weird film underneath that connected the dumplings... if you didn't peel this off, it tasted pretty funky. The scallion pancakes were tasty but a bit limp... not crispy like I've had at other restaurants. The beef pie was really yummy, I would get that again. Prices were reasonable. I wouldn't say no if someone wanted to come here, but I probably wouldn't make a special trip here otherwise.\\nThis place serves some massively huge pizzas (with massiv\\nely huge prices I might add). We had Bell 'Italia for a work function and the pizzas almost didn't fit in my car they were so huge. I got to try a variety of their pizza offerings with their white pizza with the ricotta being by far my favorite (garlic ftw) and their red sauced pizzas being a bit on the ordinary side. I don't think I'd go out of my way to eat this pizza, but it was fairly good.\\nWow.... this place may have a translated name of Squash Blossom, but it is nothing like the old squash blossom... in a good way! They completely redecorated and it now has a Latin club feel. A friend and I wandered in here Saturday night after I saw their open sign through the long hallway and wondered to myself....why is that breakfast place open at 9pm? Anyway, we sat at the bar and it was kind of awesome. We met a couple at the bar that were a lot of fun and we all did many shots...We did some series of shots that included tequila, lime juice, clamato, and beer... very interesting! We also di\\nd esperma shots (because of the funny name) which were good, shots of fireball with rum chata (delicious), and we had some of their pina colada based drinks that were sweet and tasty. The bar tender was nice and the prices were affordable (shots = 4$, drinks = 6 ish?). The place is on the loud side and I believe they had a DJ. As it got later, the bar got busier but the service remained very efficient and friendly. I had a great time here and would definitely come back. \\n\\n\\nPS Their food smelled SO good.....I want to try it ASAP... will update.\\nI went here today with my supervisor and it was very good! This place was packed...like standing room only. When a table opened shortly before we got our food it was a sweet victory. This place was much better than pei wei for sure. I ordered the pan fried noodles with chicken and it was very tasty.The sauce was all garlicky and delicious and it had a lot of veggies (broccoli, snow peas, carrots, mushrooms, etc), which is a big plus. The noodles \\nwere just ok, but what can you expect from a fast place, plus it's awesome that they offer this crispy noodle option to begin with!  My supervisor got the lemon chicken and was excited that they offer brown rice. Overall, it was good and I would go back for sure.\\nApparently this taco shop is the (current) best taco shop, so I had to try it! Believe the hype....this place is tasty! I got to try many items with my favorite being their gorditas (which remind me of sopes). I got two...one with cheese, onions, and peppers and one with red chili beef.....both were fantastic, but I liked the beef better. I tried a couple tacos as well, which were solid street tacos. They have many flavorful salsas at their (small) salsa bar (that I took for a garbage can cuz of its size and placement until I noticed people lining up in front of it). The two of us were stuffed after eating here and spent less than 20$...that's always a win. I will certainly be back to try more of their offerings and suggest yo\", 'actual_label': 42, 'predicted_label': 42}, {'text': \"u give it a try as well.\\nSo I went here this morning for breakfast and it was sooo good! I bought the groupon for brunch a few days ago and I'm glad I did. The bf and I went this morning at around nine and there was only one other couple in the restaurant. We sat down and ordered coffee and by the time we got our coffee the whole restaurant was full, so that was nice! The coffee was really good, The flavor of the coffee itself was good and they brought out a little dish of heavy whipping cream to put in it so that was delicious. Also the coffee came in this big saucer like cup which was really cute and required two hands to drink from it. Anyway.... I ordered the italian skillet and the BF ordered the blackberry waffle (which they served in place of the strawberry waffle today) and we got a little basket of pastries to share. The pastries were delicious. There were four different kinds, little mini chocolate croissants (mmmm), little blackberry danish, little orange (I think) danish, a\\nnd a cute little star pastry with raspberry. They came out hot, straight from the oven, and they were really special. My skillet was also delicious, it was potatoes with cheese, caramelized onion, pesto, and two poached eggs. The eggs were perfect and the pesto tasted so good. The BF's waffle was really awesome though.... It had blackberries and whipped cream (real whipped cream, like it tasted like heavy whipping cream, not super sweet) and honey (they offered him a lemon and apple compote but he refused...he's crazy). He let me have a bite and it was the lightest most delicious waffle I have ever had. So why 4 stars? I just can't let go of my last visit here which wasn't awesome. I am going to go back one of these days for dinner and if it is as good as breakfast was... I will definitely up it to 5 stars. Yum.\\nLet me start by saying this place will most likely be a 5 star in my book, but I need a second visit before I make that decision. The first time I tried to come to Couscous exp\\nress I was very concerned, it was 45 min or so before closing time and they were all locked up... we thought maybe they had gone out of business! Luckily for me, they must have just closed early that day. So a couple weeks later, I decided to give it another shot, but to come in earlier this time. I met Jon H, Norm, and Monica O here for linner. \\n\\nThis place was ridic! The people who work here (owners?) are so nice and accommodating. They started us off with two types of bread, one small round fluffy bread and one larger more dense bread and one of the best hummus type dips I've had.... a little spicy and packed with flavor. They also brought out delicious mint iced tea to sip and even a second hot sweet tea to try... both of which were great. For my entrée I got the beef tagine, which was huge! It had the beef and a bunch of veg (potatoes, dates, other delicious stuff) all served boiling hot in a tagine. With this came a huge amount of couscous. The meal was incredibly tasty, the cous\\ncous was light, fluffy, and delish... I could only eat a small amount, but was given a to go box and ended up making this one meal into 5 (the husband had some when I got home, and I had it for lunch, dinner, and then another lunch). We were then offered a date shake... so good... sweet, but not too sweet. They also brought out some fried honey cookie things, which I ate despite being ready to burst.\\n\\nTake home point:  I have been raving to anyone who will listen about this restaurant and need to make my triumphant return to up this great place to a 5 star level. Will be back soon!\\nI wanted to go to Arrogant butcher for a long time and finally ended up going a couple weeks ago after the Tequila Fest with the BF and Erin B. and her BF. I wasn't super hungry after the festival, but still wanted to get an appetizer or something to fill up for dinner. We were seated quickly and the service was good. My main issue with this place is their selection of appetizers. It isn't very broad and the\\nre wasn't anything I really wanted to order.... I wish they had a little more variety in their apps. So I ended up ordering a main to share. I got the short rib stew dish. It was good, it was spicy and savory. The cornbread that came with it was just ok. I also tried our friends meals, both the tortelloni (which was a little too sweet and small for the price) and the pretzels with cheese fondue (pretty good stuff). My other issue with this place is that I think it is just a touch too expensive for what you get. The food didn't amaze me, which I expect when I order essentially a bowl of soup for 15-16$. Anyway, I would give it another shot, but it isn't on the top of my list for places to return to. \\n\\nPS while we were there we saw 2 famous people eating there...so that may be some of the appeal (Xhibit and a football player from the Cardinals).\\nI have been going here for breakfast for years off and on, and I think it's an ok place. To start, the place is super cute, with all the random \", 'actual_label': 42, 'predicted_label': 42}, {'text': \"chairs and cute decorations. The service is always good also. The problem is that the food just isn't that great and it is expensive. I've had many different omelets and they are always alright... but nothing special. I went this morning with the BF and his parents. I thought it was pretty lame because only my meal came with the 'baker's basket' so they brought me 2 mini muffins on a plate... even when it has only been two of us ordering eligible things we got the whole basket, getting at least 3-4 mini muffins each. I just thought this was lame and cheap. Plus, they microwave the muffins to get them warm, so if you don't eat them quickly, they will get real chewy and less than awesome. There wasn't a long wait this morning to sit, but once we ordered we did wait for a long time to receive food... like a half hour or so. My omelet was just ok, as usual, but the potatoes were underdone and not great. It wasn't the best showing for this place. Usually the food is slightly better, which i\\ns what warranted the 3 stars versus the 2 that I thought they earned today.\\nSo I ended up coming here for lunch today at the suggestion of some fellow Yelpers (thanks for the recommendation). Maybe I built this place up too much in my head, but I thought it was just ok. It did win points for being a block away from my dad's work (which is who I went with) and having outdoor seating on such a beautiful day! It lost points because the portion sizes were very small and the food just wasn't all that special. I got the gnocchi with seasonal veggies and my dad got the chorizo and manchego cheese risotto. My food was flavorful, but the red wine sauce was a little overpowering to most of the vegetables. The gnocchi was good and the carrots were really good, but the rest was kind of lost in the sauce. The risotto also wasn't anything too special. Now, I know I will be back here because I have a groupon for this restaurant that I forgot to use today, but I will definitely try dinner. I think my \\nexperience may be a lot different then, but for now... just 3 stars.\\nWhen I saw a restaurant called 'Eggslut' I knew I needed to go there. Needless to say, the next morning my friend and I found ourselves in a long line waiting for our eggslut treats! I had debated getting their (possibly signature) dish that features an egg inside a glass jar with potato puree BUT talked myself out of it at the last minute and got their breakfast sandwich with bacon, an over medium egg, and some caramelized onions. Lucky for us, my friend and I got a free egg sandwich coupon while we stood in line, so we each only paid about 5$ ( can't complain about that). The sandwiches, however, were a little disappointing. They make all of their eggs ongoing in anticipation of people ordering them and then they assemble the sandwiches as they are ordered. This would be fine, except the sandwiches are never heated through again, leaving the premade eggs/bacon/ etc to be cold with the cheese not even being melted on\\n the sandwich. What a bummer. I think the flavor of the food was good, but it needed to be thrown under their salamander for a minute to get the gooey melty cheese goodness that is essential to a great egg sandwich (IMO). Also...they had no salt and pepper out....so weird for an egg place. I would still consider a return visit, maybe they'll work these kinks out as the restaurant gets older.\\nI ate at Beaudevin on the way out of Charlotte airport (finally!). I think I might have made the wrong choice when ordering. I was between the artichoke fondue small plate and the chicken sandwich. I asked for the waitress' opinion, and she said the fondue... went with that. Well.... I wouldn't say what I got was fondue. What does the word fondue imply to you? To me, I picture hot bubbly cheese. This was a cold spinach artichoke dip. Hmmmm... not what I was expecting. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't anything special and it was totally overpriced beyond belief. The other food looked good, so I guess th\\nat was my mistake. Regardless, based on my experience I can't recommend this restaurant.\\nThe BF and I went here the other night to use a Groupon. The experience overall was alright. We got there and the place had 1-2 tables filled on the patio. I ordered the chile relleno and it was good. It had a nice crispy outside and was filled with beans, chicken, and cheese. The BF got the empanadas which were not so good. They had a weird flavor and the ground beef tasted sort of plain...nothing special about it. Overall, the place is ok and I would go again if I were at Cityscape, but I wouldn't make a special trip to go there.\\nThe BF and I went here for lunch today because we had a living social deal that was expiring next week, so we needed to eat here pronto. Anyway, I was really looking forward to the 'amazing' carne asada. We ordered at the counter, I got the carne asada burrito, the BF got barbacoa tacos and we got a side of guac. The guac came out with three other salsas and some seeming\", 'actual_label': 42, 'predicted_label': 42}, {'text': \"ly home made chips. The chips were good, as was the guac. The red and green salsas were too watery and not very flavorful. The chunky salsa with onion and peppers was very tasty, so I was excited for the meal. Unfortunately, it did not live up to expectations. I thought both the barbacoa and the carne was bland and too chewy. Both meals were in desperate need of salsa to make them taste like something. Pretty disappointing. The beans and rice were alright, but not enough to go back. \\n\\n\\nPS although the people who worked there were nice, the lady at the counter complained to me that they don't make any money with LS deals.... Sorry, but I thought that was unprofessional. No one forced them to participate in the deal.\\nFor some reason, I felt this location's snow was far less delicious than that of the location on Camelback. It maybe was an off night, but I got my usual (thai tea snow with Nutella glaze and almond cookies) and the almond cookies tasted really stale. Eh.... I'll probably gi\\nve them another shot in the future since I love the other location.\\nI was debating between a 3 and a 4 because Kelly's has some definite high points. I met a friend at Kelly's for happy hour and it was fairly happy. The best part of the experience was our waitress who was friendly and helpful throughout our visit. She was fantastic, even when I was being ridiculously indecisive. Anyway, we each got a drink, I got the AZ mule and my friend had basically a vodka cranberry... both drinks were fine, but nothing special. For food, I had the pork wings and the short rib tacos. The pork was alright, tender and covered in a flavorful sauce, but the meat itself was a little gamey tasting. They were served over a super tasty spicy slaw, which I could have eaten all day. Despite this, I don't think I would order this again. The tacos were also fairly tasty, 3 tiny tacos with hot red peppers on top of short rib.... how bad can it be? Again, it was good, but not something I would crave necessarily.\\n All the food and drink were reasonably priced on hh. I would come back here, but maybe order a bit differently next time.\\n\\nPS I don't know what was going on, but their bathroom when I went was missing a door handle and a lock... could make for an awkward night...\\n\\nPPS I really want to try their burgers... they looked really tasty!\\nI came here a couple weeks ago to get some coffee after hearing good things about this place. The coffee was just not very good. It didn't have a lot of flavor and just was meh. I might have high expectations after living in Seattle, but this coffee wasn't even as good as dunkin donuts.... so.... I'd pass.\\nOk...I know you've heard it before...but the lentil soup is a definite 5 star! It is absolutely delicious...so much so that I wanted to lick the bowl...but I didn't, I just spoon licked it instead (you know....scraping and scraping until it's gone?)...yum. The other food that my friend and I got was good, but not even close to as good as that soup (which i\\ns definitely what I'm getting next time). I got the chicken biryani and my friend got the chicken curry. My chicken was good...it was a little spicy, but also a little sweet with a cinnamon -y flavor to it. My friend's curry was a typical curry...nothing terribly special. The service here was super slow...we waited like 20 minutes to even get water....which is unfortunate, but I can kind of understand it because it is only one girl running the whole front of house and she was busy. Despite this, it was still frustrating to just sit there and wait for so long. However, the good did outweigh the bad and I always like to go to family run restaurants, so I'll be back.\\nI went here tonight for dinner with a couple of friends and I must say... it was pretty meh. I don't really understand how this chain got as big as it is because it is overpriced and not very good. Plus the 'kitsch' is kind of annoying, right down to all of fake enthusiasm and the names of menu items. I got the potato soup an\\nd salad combo (which costs 9$) and the salad was pretty terrible. It looked like they opened a bag of rabbit salad and dumped it on a plate with some cheese on it. The lettuce tasted like it had not been washed. The soup was mediocre, not bad, but not as good as potato soups I have had at other chain restaurants. Oh...and there was a bug on our table. You heard me. A bug. I don't know what it was....but it was a medium sized bug and was kind of gross and unappetizing. I'm not trying to say the place is dirty, because I'm sure every restaurant has had a bug come in...hard to avoid....but I think the place should be maintained enough to keep them off of the tables at least. Anyway, I feel that my money and calories are best spent elsewhere, sorry RR.\\nI went to Scramble this weekend with the BF while waiting for my car to be fixed. You come in and order at the counter and then sit down. We went at about 10 am on a Saturday and it was busy, but there were tables available. I had the alma b\", 'actual_label': 42, 'predicted_label': 42}, {'text': \"rizza. What an awesome idea! The crust was good, the brizza was flavorful, my only problem with it was that it was WAY too big. I ate half and was full. The BF got biscuits and gravy and said it tasted like pepperoni pizza...in a good way. The breakfast was not at all healthy, but if I were in the neighborhood, I would go back.\\nWhat a neat little shop! I have passed by the Tempe Farmers Market several times and always wondered what was inside. Clearly it wasn't what one normally thinks of when thinking of a farmer's market (temporary space with a bunch of vendors....). I finally made it in and was surprised by the variety of items that were offered. The TFM has local fruits and veg as well as many awesome local food products for fairly reasonable prices. They have everything from yogurt to frozen tamales to fresh tortillas.... I ended up buying a half loaf of bread for 2$ (which is an awesome idea BTW... sometimes you don't need a whole loaf), a jar of tahini (priced cheaper than at th\\ne grocery), and some locally roasted coffee (cortez). Anyway, I would definitely stop in here again if I were in the neighborhood!\\nI have been to Urban Beans twice... once several years ago and again a couple months ago.... and they are very close to my house...so that says something. Their coffee just isn't very good. I believe they use expressions roasting (same as bikini beans) and the quality of their lattes just aren't fabulous. The last time I tried UB I had their 'spicy' dirty chai.... it just wasn't anything special. They get their 3rd star for their fabulous hours, but if I needed a coffee, and it wasn't the middle of the night, I would definitely go elsewhere.\\nUgh... I have had the food at humble pie in the airport and it was fine, but way overpriced. On this visit, I was drawn in by a menu stating a glass of sangria was 7$... Definitely as cheap as I would get a drink in this part of the airport. I ordered a glass and it was fairly mediocre. Got the bill...  It cost 9$... Wh\\nat the... I asked for the menu again, apparently they changed the price on most of the menus using pen or marker, but not the one I had seen. There was no way for me to prove it, so I sadly paid for the crappy drink and was on my way. I'll go elsewhere next time.\\nThis place is no longer in business... It's now Villa Peru I believe. I went searching for this place to go eat breakfast, only to find that other place (and it wasn't open... *tear*).\\nI had never even heard of Cleo until I was riding the deuce from the strip to Fremont Street. I saw Cleo advertised outside the SLS casino and looked it up on Yelp. I was surprised that it hadn't come up in previous searches given its rave reviews. I knew I had to try it. My friend and I already had dinner plans , so we came to Cleo to try an appetizer and a dessert close to closing time. We had an amazing waitress who was friendly and gave great advice on what to order. We ended up getting the eggplant moussaka and the sticky toffee pudding. Th\\ne eggplant moussaka was like heaven! The eggplant was tender, beautifully cooked. It had a good balance of richness from the cheese and acidity from the tomato sauce. This isn't the type of dish I would typically order, but this dish inspired me to try moussaka again. The dessert was also on point, but maybe not quite as good as the eggplant. The sticky toffee pudding was served warm with a large scoop of vanilla ice cream and a tasty sauce on the bottom of the plate. The next time I'm in Vegas I would like to try a full meal at this restaurant. It was definitely worth the somewhat high price point.\\nLet me start by saying that I really liked Tarbell's and was excited to try the Tavern. You should note that the parking lot here is tiny and has complimentary valet. Anyway, I met my dad here for dinner and we shared the chilaquiles, a patty melt, and onion rings. The patty melt was alright, though the meat didn't fill the bread (and it probably should for 17$). It came with chips (which i\\nt does not say on their menu). The chilaquiles were fairly mediocre. They lacked in flavor and the portion was small. The onion rings were tasty.. nice and crispy. The service was efficient. The prices were very high for the food we got. I would come back if someone were taking me, but I wouldn't come back here on my own dime.\\nI went here a few weeks ago (and forgot to review?!?!). I went with the BF on a saturday morning to get some coffee to go with some cupcakes we got the night before (we're health nuts). I had heard good things about Steve's and wanted to give them a try instead of going to our usual (Cartel), and they are on my list for the coffee tour of phoenix (which I am only a few coffee shops deep in). Anyway, so the place looks like a standard coffee shop and smells delicious like baking pastries and cinnamon.... *drool. I wish I didn't have those cupcakes at home cuz their food offerings looked delicious. I ordered a latte and the BF got their house roast drip. The coffee\", 'actual_label': 42, 'predicted_label': 42}, {'text': \" was sadly just ok. My latte wasn't really frothy at the top like most are and the flavor was a little off for me... can't put my finger on why. The Bf's was fine, but it was just regular old coffee, so it's always pretty fine. I will come back here, however, because they have lots of cool sounding coffee drinks, like aztec coffee..... also, I want to try those pastries! They are also slightly less expensive than Cartel.... although I have to say, from this one experience, Cartel wins.\\nI went here tonight for their grand opening and was shocked by how not impressive the food was. I hate to give a negative review as a first review and also hate to give a negative review to a place that allowed me to come to their grand opening, but it just wasn't very good. The food they were serving definitely should have been good, for example, they had a kobe beef slider....sounds good, right? No....it was not good. It was ground kobe, not sure why you would grind such expensive meat, and it was cove\\nred in a weird sauce and then topped with velveeta. Yes....velveeta. It was such a waste of a good meat, you couldn't taste the meat at all...it could have been ground anything for all you could tell. Additionally, the BF found a bone in his....not so appetizing. They also had mini burger bites, that were decent, but the way they were served made it so you couldn't taste any of the toppings because they all fell off before it got to your mouth (they were little balls with bacon and whatnot on top skewered with a toothpick, so the bacon and things fell off when the burger was picked up). The crab mac and cheese was mediocre and I believe had velveeta in it as well....how weird. The pork sweet and spicy wings were an odd texture and tasted like frozen food. Not good. The only thing that was decent was the spicy mango cone....a mango pudding of sorts with cayenne in it served in an ice cream cone. We ended up leaving after only a short period of time because we didn't want to continue tas\\nting/wasting their food....that's pretty bad when the food is free. Maybe this place just needs to work out some kinks, but it was surprising that they hadn't done so before this event.\\nThis place is cheap and pours huge drinks with insane amounts of alcohol in them. You need to be careful though because the drinks have so much alcohol, you don't realize how much you really are drinking. I had 2 and was sick.... not usual for me. Also, the bathrooms are small and when I was there one was out of commission for being too nasty to use, oh and someone threw up in one of the sinks..... classy. So.... I don't know if I'd come back, but it's good for what it is, an extremely loud college bar that is very crowded, but very cheap, and good to get drunk for barely any money.\\nWhat a cute festival! I have been to the Local First Fall Fest the last 3 years, and each year has been fun. The first year I went, the food samples were free, which was ridiculously awesome... now, obviously that didn't las\\nt... but at 1$ per sample, you can get pretty full for a decent price. This year I dined on delicious pumpkin soup from St Francis, a yummy taco from Joyride, an ice cream sandwich from Churn, amazing salted caramel pudding from Arrogant Butcher, and treats from LGO (amongst many other things... I was so full). There were many cute items for sale, I scored an adorable necklace. The festival isn't overly large and isn't a full day activity by any means, but that's ok. Overall, I think this is a fun free (entry anyway) activity that's worth going to year after year.\\nPros:\\n\\n1. The games are free. That is awesome assuming the place isn't too busy. They have a small, but decent, selection of arcade games to choose from including a Mortal Kombat game (FTW!!!). \\n\\n2. They have beer....said beer is decently priced. \\n\\n3. They have happy hour.... who doesn't like happy hour? \\n\\n4. Their staff are generally friendly. \\n\\n5. They have trivia night on Thursdays at 7 pm and it is free to play.\\n\\n6. The G\\nolden Banana..... a beer cocktail that is fabulous (think chocolaty beer mixed with fruity flavors....it sounds weird, but it' really good). \\n\\n7. The atmosphere is fun and their mural on the wall is fabulous!\\n\\n\\nCons:\\n\\n1. If they are busy, service is hard to come by. \\n\\n2. Most of their cocktails have been just ok.... I haven't come across any cocktails (save my beertail (?) discussed in the Pros) that I would order again off their specialty cocktail menu. \\n\\n3. The trivia is a 'Geeks Who Drink' trivia night, which is a bit less fun than the original trivia nights you can find in other bars (not really the bar's fault, but you know).\\n\\n4. Their food is a bit lack luster. It's supposed to be sort of 'grimy' I guess...their menu has things like grilled cheese and tater tots and choco tacos on it. I tried their gordito and it was fine, but not something I would get again. \\n\\n\\n\\nTry them out, there's really nothing to lose.\\nI went here last night with the BF cuz it was 10 pm and we hadn't eaten \", 'actual_label': 42, 'predicted_label': 42}, {'text': \"anything yet. The pizza is not flavorful, it's greasy and it wasn't heated up enough. If I wanted reheated flavorless pizza, I can make a frozen one at home and it would be much less expensive. Plus the place feels grungy and dirty. I used to like this place 5 years ago.... but sorry slices, not my thing anymore.\\nWell..... I was really excited to try Stumpy's.... They have a lot of good looking items on their menu and their prices are very affordable. Unfortunately, there's a reason for that. Their food is just ok. The husband and I got garlic sticks, pizza, and wings. We are in the restaurant, so we could see that they use a conveyor belt pizza oven and a microwave for a lot of their cooking. The pizza was ok, very greasy, but not terrible....just not a pizza I would go out of my way to get again. The wings were tasty and had a good tasting sauce. The best item was the garlic sticks....these things were crazy garlicky. Anyway, I may go back to Stumpy's if I were in the area, but I wou\\nldn't go out of my way to go here.\\nah Chino. I have been going here for years, well actually the other location, but same place. This location is really hard to find if you don't know where it is.... it seems like the location is not really great for their business... but I dunno. This place is good in that bad kind of way. The food is greasy, it comes out on paper plates or in tin take out dishes. It pretty much always makes me feel sick after eating there.... but I still eat there because it's just good sometimes. I always get an emerald chicken burrito and machaca quesadilla in a combo with the jerk fried rice. The emerald chicken is good.... all white meat and really oniony. It's one of the more asian-y dishes. The machaca is good too, just standard shredded beef with tomato, garlic, and onion.The BF gets bean and cheese burritos and seems to like them. I think the thing that always brings me back is the free snickerdoodles. They're sooo good....and also they are free which makes t\\nhem even better. So against my better judgment, I will keep going to Chino Bandito.... \\n\\n\\nOh, and if you're drunk... this place gets at least one more star.\\nThis place is right by my house. I pass it all the time. Why didn't I stop in sooner? Who knows. This place is very cute inside, kind of retro...kind of reminds me of an old school Fuddruckers from when I was a kid. Also, this place has a bar! With specials! I clearly didn't realize this. Anyway, I went here last Friday and got a burger with cheddar, guac, grilled onions, and bacon... It really tasted like a backyard BBQ burger, which I liked. Nothing fancy here. The husband had a burger as well and enjoyed it. The bill was under 20$ I will definitely be back.\\nI went to this place today for lunch with a friend and I was excited to try it as it uses local ingredients (which is pretty cool). The place did not disappoint. The restaurant is very cutely decorated, which was not expected considering the plaza it is located it, the walls \\nhave really modern patterns on them in fun colors. When we walked in, it was a bit awkward because we were supposed to seat ourselves but we didn't know (no sign) so we kind of stood there and the hostess stood there and then finally we were told to seat ourselves. This wasn't a huge deal and will probably improve as the restaurant gets a bit older. For lunch we split the beef tacos and the chicken pita nini with the jalapeno pesto both on the recommendation of our waiter (who was very attentive). We both had water to drink and I liked that they took the time to use cucumber in their water, but garnish the glass with a lemon...a nice little detail. The pita nini was tasty and came with a creamy sauce on the side that was good on it. It wasn't spicy at all like I thought it might be, but it did have a very good flavor. The tacos were very tasty AND huge! There were three tacos that were overflowing with filling. They had pieces of beef, some cabbage, some cotija cheese, pico and avocado\\n. They were marked as spicy on the menu, but I didn't find them very spicy. They were flavorful, however, and the portion can easily be shared between two people. The food was all very fresh which I thought was nice. This place could easily be overlooked, as it is not noticeable from the street or even from within the shopping center unless you are looking for it. Next time I would like to try the jalapeno cilantro hummus and one of the soups, but there will definitely be a next time. Don't miss out on this cute little restaurant!\\nThis place looks very dirty. I don't know if it is, but I didn't feel very comfortable eating there. I did eat there, though, and the food was pretty mediocre. Nothing had much flavor or spice. I would not come here again.\\nI came here with the family for my Gram's birthday. Overall, it was just ok, especially for the price. I had their drink that had ginger and peach, was actually very good, but expensive. The husband had a manhattan and liked it very much. M\", 'actual_label': 42, 'predicted_label': 42}, {'text': \"y step mom and I split the gnocchi and the bruschetta and I had the tomato bisque with croutons. The tomato bisque was very tasty, smokey, I would get it again. The bruschetta was ok... the prosciutto was a little on the thick side. The bacon jam was very tasty. The gnocchi, on the other hand, was not so good...very dry and lacking flavor. It was nice that they split it into two bowls for us. The husband had the burger and liked it very much, I thought it was good, but not a 16$ burger. Overall, this place would be fine if their prices were lower, but I guess that's what you get for being a semi cool restaurant in Chandler.\\nThe BF and I tried Habit for lunch today and really liked it. I had a burger with cheese and he had a double burger with cheese meal. I also had a side caesar salad. I really liked that this place puts grilled onions on the burger and the fact that they have a lot of different sides to choose from. My salad was better than expected for a fast food place. I tried a f\\nry and thought it was good, nice and crispy. The burgers were a good size, not so big that I felt sick after eating it, but  filling. I think if I wanted to get a fast food burger again, I would come here over In and Out (I'm not a fan of in and out.... always leaves an oily feel in my mouth). The people who work there were also very friendly, their credit card reader wasn't working, but the lady at the register was still really nice despite looking a bit stressed. Another girl who works there offered to take our tray on her way back to work from her lunch break. Anyway, it was a good place, I want to go back to try their other sandwiches.\\nLet me start by saying the owner of this place is amazing and friendly. I stopped in for a coffee (which is locally roasted BTW.... A step up as compared to most coffee options in Ahwatukee) and the owner gave me a bunch of cookies to share with my students.... That was totally unexpected and so generous! I'll be back soon to try their food (and othe\\nr pastries) , which looks amazing. Definitely check this new restaurant out if you're in the area.\\nI wanted to come here for the Kouign Amann....but they were out! Devastating! Anyway, I settled for a little pecan tart.... delicious. The pastry was golden and the filling was rich. The prices were fair and the rest of the baked goods looked incredible. I would definitely stop by this bakery while in Montreal!\\nuuuuuugh. What a sorry disappointment of a meal. The BF and I went here for dinner tonight and it was pretty not good. I got the pick two with the balsamic steak 'panini' and the chicken stew. The BF got a turkey 'panini.' Well....his 'panini' was barely toasted, let alone a panini. My sandwich was toasted but the steak was pretty gross....chewy and tasted like it came out of a bag. The tomatoes were mealy. The whole thing was sad. The chicken stew was decent, but had that plastic -y look to it. I always find that a little disturbing. It came with a biscuit that was really gross an\\nd didn't go with the stew at all. Both of our cookies were raw in the middle. Plus the meal cost 20$. Really?! 20$?!?! Are they kidding me? I could get a countless amount of better food for that money. Not awesome. Not even good. I won't be returning.\\nReally Yelpers? I was super disappointed with AZ Donut co. Yes I went at about 9:30 pm, so maybe that affected the deliciousness of these donuts, but overall there was very little deliciousness to be had. I tried the banana cream donut and it was weird... artificial... in flavor, greasy, and unpleasant. My friend also had a donut and said it wasn't even as good as Dunkin. I had coffee, which was nothing special. I would not return, there are better donut establishments in town.\\nThe BF and I went here this morning after thinking about trying this place for awhile. Let me start by saying that in order to look at their menu online you need to download adobe reader and even then, no prices are listed. That was my first semi complaint, but I f\\nigured it would be good, so I shouldn't worry too much about that. So we got there at around noon and the place is cute, big patio and all. We were seated and got water from the very nice bus boy who works there. Our waiter came by and we both ordered coffee, I got the fire island eggs and the BF got the biscuits and gravy. When we got our coffee we were assured that the food would be out shortly. Well...I don't know what shortly means to them, but we waited a good 20 minutes or so for our food. Not so awesome. The BF's coffee was empty for about 10 minutes of this time with no offer to refill and no one around to ask. We get our food and mine was alright...it's chicken in a cream cheese semi spicy sauce on 'pizza' bread (kind of thick...not really crusty, but whatever). The flavor was just very one dimensional and the dish got boring after the first few bites....it was kind of too rich, which isn't something I would generally say. The BF's biscuits and gravy were not good. He said the\", 'actual_label': 42, 'predicted_label': 42}, {'text': \"y tasted like a pizza hut meat lover's pizza. The biscuits were not light or flaky and the gravy was just one note...spicy. Plus, the gravy tasted the same as the potatoes that came with it (kind of like peppers)....so it was a big plate of one flavor, and not even a very good flavor. Additionally, and not necessarily the restaurant's fault, there were tons of flies around....they kept landing on our cups and it was somewhat annoying...maybe the trash needs to be taken out more often? Or maybe it's because people had their dogs at this restaurant, which I think is somewhat gross...I don't know, just not so pleasant. So the waiter comes by and takes the plates away and then we sit and wait...and wait...and wait for our check. I don't really understand this because I would think that he would have wanted the check as soon as possible, but maybe he knew he did a poor job and had given up on our table. Either way, after ten more minutes or so we got the check and paid cash to avoid the ine\\nvitable long wait if paying with a credit card. The total was 27$...that's pretty pricey considering the quality of this meal...feels like a waste of money to me. So if you like having all of your food taste like peppers and that's it and over paying for that experience....this is the place for you, otherwise, I'd say skip this place.\\nI love Tacos Chiwas, so when I heard they were opening a coffee and tamale place nextdoor, I was super excited! They opened recently and I checked them out this morning. The space is cute and the smell of the tamales was mouth watering. I tried their special coffee that's made with cinnamon and piloncillo syrup....It was good, but not what I expected as it isn't milk based....More like cinnamon -y coffee. Anyway, the real stars here are the tamales.... I tried the red chili tamale and it was pretty legit....Also, it was priced at 2.50, which is super cheap compared to most restaurants. I'll be back!\\nI went to the Farm Kitchen today after hiking South Moun\\ntain. I must say, I was not thoroughly impressed. The way the set up their line is odd and confuses people which makes the process not as fluid as it could be. They make you enter by the registers, which is apparently where you order food, but first you must go to the other side of the building to get drinks, but if you want water, it's serve yourself and behind you....kind of convoluted. The food is also overpriced. My step mom got a sandwich and I got a side salad and a cup of soup and it was 25$. I had their vegetarian soup of the day, which was a white bean and green chili soup. The soup tasted alright, but the beans were a bit underdone IMO, they still were pretty chewy, not soft like they usually are. The salad was alright, but a salads a salad. My step mom said her sandwich was fine, but nothing special. The good part about this restaurant is that it's on the farm and the scenery is beautiful. Despite this, I think that Morning Glory is much better and will most likely go there \\nnext time.\\nNow this is the kind of bar I have been looking for in Phoenix! I went here last night with the BF and some friends and it was just the nicest little place, especially after spending the night before on mill... ugh. The decor reminds me of what your super hip friend's basement might look like. It has funky furniture and this light display that you can see when you are coming up the stairs that changes colors from the middle out (I stared at that thing extensively after a few drinks, and it was mighty entertaining). The place has strange movies and shorts being shown on the tvs. We watched a short about a kid cutting open a rabbit and an idol came out that demanded to eat jam.... pretty cool stuff. The place has comfortable couches and I liked that it wasn't too loud to have a conversation nor was it too busy for me to get a drink fairly quickly and without being bumped around. \\n\\nAnyway, the bartender really knows what she is doing and the fact that so many of their ingredien\\nts for cocktails are made in house and fresh is a huge selling point for me. I tried four different specialty cocktails. First I had the pama mojito. This was by far the best drink of the night. The bartender uses fresh mint and fresh limes, beats them to a pulp, then adds in house made simple syrup and in house made sweet and sour and some pama liquor and it is wonderful. So easy to drink and refreshing. I don't even usually like mojitos that much, but this was great and I'm glad I gave it a try. I also tried my friend's drink which was the blueberry and jameson drink, with (of course) fresh blueberries. Also good, but I'm not a whiskey drinker generally. So then I had a sidebar collins, which is good and simple. Finally I had the butterscotch martini.... it is as good as it sounds. I will most definitely be back at this bar in the future, it is by far the best bar I have experienced in Arizona. \\n\\nPS after a few drinks, check out the bathrooms... they have crazy iridescent tiles that \", 'actual_label': 42, 'predicted_label': 42}, {'text': \"looks super cool and there is a neat looking sink too.\\nOf all the Fox restaurants in town, I think this one is in my top 3. I've been wanting to try Olive and Ivy for a long time, so when I got notification that they were offering 25% off on Memorial day, I pretty much had to go. I (luckily) made a reservation (otherwise there was a 45 min wait at lunch time). We were seated right away. We had fantastic service throughout with a knowledgeable and friendly waitress. We had the delicious pesto and bread ( 2 servings because I'm a pig) and we split the bacon cheeseburger and the lasagna. The cheeseburger was tasty, with a definite charred taste to it. The onions were really good (and the pesto that came with the bread was good on it too). The lasagna was also tasty, with a distinctly red wine based Bolognese sauce. The portion was large allowing us to take half home. Also, it came with some of the most fantastic garlic bread.... just oozing with butter and garlic... I'd come here just for\\n that. I'll be back!\\nI have been to this Red Devil location a few times and it has been fairly good each time. They have decent pizza, and (imo) good bruschetta, because they put the tomatoes and whatnot on garlic bread... yum. Also, they give you a lot of food for reasonable prices. I had bought the living social deal and ended up getting a 14 inch three topping pizza and bruschetta for around 1$. Whoa! I was pretty proud. I went there for dinner tonight, and it was good, but the service was a bit shakey. Also, I got a white pizza with garlic amongst other toppings and it tasted like the garlic was forgotten.... sad day. I would recommend sitting in the bar. Also, PINBALL!!!!\\nPita Jungle is delish and this location is no exception. I came here with a large party (10+) and they accommodated us well and gave us great service. I had the chicken tikka masala, which was unlike the typical version of this dish, but absolutely delicious topped with pea shoots. The portion was giant, I took a\\n big container of it home. I also got to try one of the flatbreads, which was spicy and fresh tasting, a variety of tasty hummuses (hummi?), and the dolmades. Everything was good. Definitely recommend it!\\nSo yesterday I had a training right near this little place and I went here....twice.....whoa. I went in the morning and had the nutella mocha....now, I don't even really like mochas that much, but this was a completely different story. It wasn't too sweet, but it was sweet, and it had that nutty and delicious Nutella flavor.....oh my. Thank god I don't live near here or I would be spending a lot of money and calories on this delicious drink. Anyway, I came back for lunch (but they were still serving breakfast). I got their New Mexican breakfast burrito and it was alright, but not as good as many say. I really like the green chili sauce that came with the burrito, but the burrito itself was pretty generic. Anyway, I would like to come back and try their lunch or dinner food and I will \\ndefinitely be back for a nutella mocha (but not too soon!).\\nThis is some seriously good pizza. I had it a couple week ago at food truck friday and it was just delicious. Like going to a fancy shmancy pizza place, but only like 8$....can't beat that! I got the popeye (?), the one with spinach, garlic, tomato, basil, and deliciousness. It was just wonderful...I will definitely be back here...yum!\\nLet me start by saying, the type of coffee served at Tres Leches is not the type of coffee I typically drink. They serve very interesting and tasty SWEET coffee drinks. I do like them, but I feel they are more like dessert. Their new location is a cute house with parking in the back. The churro latte seriously tastes like a churro...maybe even better. I always get my coffee hot, but I can only imagine the iced versions are even more dessertesque. The service is friendly, the prices are average. If you haven't tried it, I suggest you go!\\nI cannot believe I came here and did not get the brussels s\\nprout nachos!!! I totally spaced it (possibly due to the copious amount of drinks that were imbibed on this particular night). Anyway, I guess that's a reason to return sooner rather than later. Diego Pops was a fun little restaurant with excellent service. A friend and I went around 9:30 at night, and they were semi busy, but not crazy. We ordered the chips and salsas.... the salsas were all delish. It was fun to eat the chips with the 4 or 5 different salsas. We also tried 4 different tacos, and all were tasty with the fried fish being the most  underwhelming and the pineapple pork and machaca being the tastiest. All were fairly good and large! The one drink we tried was the guava coconut because....well... it's served in a coconut!!! The drink itself was just ok, but it added to the experience. I would LOVE to come back for happy hour the next time I find myself in Scottsdale.\\nFull disclosure: After our last trip, which went awry (see the review), I got a phone call from the manager\", 'actual_label': 42, 'predicted_label': 42}, {'text': 'ed as we eat!\\nA group of us friends were having a epic night but still weren\\'t ready to part and ended up at the bar side of the Sparklings. \\n\\nEverytime I hear this name it sounds like I\\'m going to a Barbie and Ken esque couples house and really, the decor is the right amount of homey chic that I would like to believe it so. \\n\\nDespite me being too full to try the amazing looking food, the comments from friends were more than positive. It was happy hour which had drink and food specials from 10pm to close (2am - ish). Our server/bartender, Jose, was also such a personality and was absolutely a sweetheart. \\n\\nI wish this was in the NW close to me instead as it\\'s a beautiful spot to hang out late night, and a lovely place to eat during day. It looks like a typical neighborhood lodge bar from the outside, but it totally isn\\'t and doesn\\'t serve plain ole\\' bar food. \\n\\nI will be back very soon, for a full dinner. But for late night, this place is a absolutely great spot.\\nThis sandwich and rugu\\nlach habit is getting ridiculous. The BF and I have come back several times in such a short span. \\n\\nThe first few times we got breakfast and I highly recommend for eggs benedict fans to get it here. I love hollandaise and they are not skimpy with it, ham actually has flavor, perfect poach eggs. I tried the crab cake version too, and surprised I liked the original better. The corned beef hash was another we tried and I thought it was tasty. I love their potatoes the brekkies come with and the bagels of their name sake actually are quite nice. \\n\\nThen I decided to try their corned beef sandwich and was prepared to be only mildly satisfied. I have a little Jewish corner of my heart that beats for childhood Saturdays at Langer\\'s. The corned beef was flavorful, juicy and the marbled bread I chose was great. I always eat mine with  coleslaw and Russian dressing (aka thousand island). I\\'m normally into pickles, but theirs is closer to cucumber than pickle so I\\'m not the most fond of it. The sa\\nndwich was so good, I was a bit sad to  share with the BF and take the other half of the benedict even though I love the bennie. \\n\\nSo we came back several more times to get our own. I have to say that the way to go is the soup and half sandwich deal ($10.95- $11.95). It actually comes out cheaper with more food since the sandwich was just as big as a 1/4th lb, you get soup and can even get a side if you wish for $1. The matzo ball soup here is decent, and the sweet and sour stuffed cabbage was nice though I dropped my phone in it trying to Yelp it. We also tried the lobster salad sandwich and that was solid, but I\\'m gonna stay with the meat sandwiches..... I should mention I lean towards mostly eating vegetarian and this place is testing it. \\n\\nService is pretty decent on checking up. We also don\\'t go during busy times as this is the type of place that gets swamped during regular breakfast/lunch hours on weekends. Beat the busy by heading in a bit later in the afternoon. \\n\\nWhile the san\\ndwich and benedict have been stellar, the dessert counter has been extreme highs and lows so much so that I can\\'t justify a 5star. \\n\\nThe best: The rugulach are awesomely good. I normally don\\'t like chocolate ones but I love them here, the almond ones are great, all the fruit ones are great. There is not a bad one so even though it is priced per pound, I feel this is worth it. \\nThe subpar: I\\'m not fond of the black and white cookie being more like cake. I know a lot of delis do this and I\\'m just more of a shadortbred person.  The rainbow cookies were okay, but not quite up to my standard with it being too wet though the sponge flavor was right on (those are one of my favorite deli sweets). The homemade twinkie was a bit dry.\\n The bad: we got a slice of buttercream cake which was painfully sweet with the frosting tasting like boxed. It was thick, sticky and you can feel sugar granules in it with the cake itself also rather sweet. It was a throwaway so I will not be getting anything else \\nbut rugulachs. The desserts aren\\'t cheap for what they are...Spent $27 with only the rugulachs being the only thing we are gonna eat the entirety of. \\n\\nThis is great place and I do highly recommend this as a go-to if you\\'re in the area, just know how to navigate the deli and massive menu through recommendations.\\nThis is behind Itoy Sarili Atin in favorite cafeteria/Turo-turo style, but I am a fan because certain dishes are served here that Itoy doesn\\'t have. \\n\\nI dont know what its called (for shame! I am part flip!) but its a dish where like hearts and liver and such is diced and cooked in a light tomato sauce with onions and like peppers. My family used to cook this and they usually have that here.\\n\\n I\\'ve tried more of the \"staples\" and its pretty good here. This place is popular so the food gets enough turnover throughout the day. \\n\\nOnly demerit, sometimes it\\'s not so clean...like plates are just left on the table and arent picked up.\\nYears ago (before Yelp) I came to this bakery lat', 'actual_label': 43, 'predicted_label': 42}, {'text': 'e night after a meal at Ichiza and was gravely disappointed. Half of the items we bought we did not even eat, and unfortunately we got a lot of items for us and the family to share....it would have been a (kind) 2 star then. I just dismissed this place as a no-go until I found the recent, very positive reviews on Yelp. It has been years and if some of my Yelparazzi were saying yes to the Crown, I had to try it again.\\n\\nAfter dim sum, the BF, my Yelpalicious two- Angela H. and Elnino F., and I went for some sweet treats and cool libations.\\n\\nBF and I were coming for the shaved ice to help us ease living in this damned fire bowl of a city. Their menu said it is \"the best shaved ice in Vegas\" so it was a must try. It was a good portion- has FINE ice shavings (yay! so many places do too rough/big shavings), fresh fruit (strawberry, kiwi, strawberry, blueberry), canned fruit (pineapple, peach), red bean, milk and some syrup. It was pretty good actually. I\\'m very glad they aren\\'t heavy on the \\ncondensed milk and syrups but had a right amount of sweet. I would get this again and is indeed better than downstairs at Tea Station. I coaxed my Yelpies to take a bite and since they were eating on it, I think it\\'s a good sign we all agreed. \\n\\nPastry wise, definitely was a different experience from years ago....\\n\\nThey had some samples of cookies out and they were all very good. The green tea cookies in particular sparked my interest and I bought a package. They have a nice crisp, yet soft biscuit consistency with fine sliced almonds. They had a bit of sweet, but still had the distinct and somewhat bitter (a good thing) flavor profile matcha has. I think I have to get all the flavors of these- plain, chocolate, green tea, coffee were all good. \\n\\nI also got a red bean bun after much praise from Misti. Spot on find. I am eating it as we speak and I want to go and get more. This is one of the best red bean buns I\\'ve had. It has a few nuts in it- walnuts it seems and it adds a nice touch \\nto the texture and is something different. \\n\\n The BF picked up  bowtie mini crisps, plain madeleines, chocolate cream puffs, and pecan tart to share with his mom later. His picks were all pretty good, satisfying the sweet tooth but not overtly sweet. I like the cream puffs a lot- they\\'re petite sized and the chocolate has different \"levels\". Chocolate dip on top, light cacao shell, and the cream had a almost mocha flavor with the whisper of a almost Kahlua-ish quality to it.\\n\\nThe kicker is the lady of the bakery was sweet and hospitable. It was full pretty full so we had a back corner table that was a bit hotter than the other tables. Once a table came available she let us know so we can be more comfortable. As we sat and chatted she came over to check on us and gave us gratis a green tea madeleine and thin coconut crisps to nosh on. Unexpected and sweet of her. Of course, they were pretty good...I should probably pick up these next time. \\n\\nI thought the interior was cute. The vibe was\\n comfortable to sit around for a bit and enjoy your treats...many Asian bakeries don\\'t even tables and the few that do, it\\'s just what it is- a table. In such a sparse space it can almost feel clinical in some places. Here you sit on wood benches with throw pillows and old quaint chairs so it has a comfy shabby chic thing going for them. \\n\\nI think I will be back, soon.... I hope!. I think I found a favorite place to grab some snacks and drinks.\\nI\\'m very glad that one of my favorite parks in Vegas, is actually the closest park to me.  I love that it is busy, but never feels crowded because of the size and the layout. Also it is nicely kept-I see dead plants one week and the next weekend, there\\'s new plants in the planters. \\n\\nThe playground here is pleasant with a very cute flower and bug design. There is a aqua pad for the kids to cool off (for kids but doesnt stop me from running through it real quick on a hot day!) , the usual suspects and also some tall tube slides that I havent seen\\n in other parks. \\n\\nThere are pavilions scattered about so if you want some privacy to your gathering there are a few lone, out of the ways one as well as pavilions close to the crowd/playground. There are wide jogging trails, also two soccer fields, quite a few sand volleyball courts and open fields that you can just run around and play. There is a amphitheater where the park holds different shows and movies throughout the year.\\n\\nMy favorite feature of course is the dog park! There is decent space in each run (one for big dogs and the other for small dogs/seniors)  and is all grass. The grass stays green all year and it\\'s inevitable to have poop, but it seems they clean up pretty often. There is a good mix of people and dog breeds who come here, but people are responsible so there hasn\\'t been any issues here with fights or attacks. We\\'ve made some friends with the \"regulars\" and I admittedly am I liiiittttlle biased that there\\'s a large number of pug owners here.\\n\\nIt\\'s close to some ot', 'actual_label': 43, 'predicted_label': 43}, {'text': 'her favorite public features that are not to be skipped. Hell, you head to the YMCA and ride on some slides at their pool and then go to the library grab a good book or CD and enjoy it under a tree at the park and have a picnic lunch! Sounds like a great day in the Northwest to me.\\nSo many shoes. \\n\\nI know, with that many shoes you\\'d think I\\'d always find what I\\'m looking for but not always so. I swear, when I was looking for boots, not much there. Now that I need flats for work and it\\'s coming to warmer weather, its nothing but boots that I now don\\'t need. It\\'s a discount store so it\\'s changing constantly which can be good/bad depending if you\\'re very specific about what you are looking for.\\n\\nA plus is that it seems they have a good stock of every size. I saw size 5s all the way to size 11 ladies shoes. Many half sizes too and a few things come in wide or narrow.  If you have a odd size, I would highly suggest this place. \\n\\nOverall, not bad place to add to shoe shopping stops.\\nThe BF a\\nnd I decided to have a date day starting with a nice lunch. I\\'ve heard about this 3 course $20.12 meal which used to be weekday. When I found out that they now serve it everyday until 2:30pm we headed straight over. \\n\\nI love the airy room and the terrace looks like a nice option to enjoy on a rare nice day. It was too hot so we stayed inside. \\n\\nThey start you off with grilled, crusty bread and some good olive oil.\\n\\nStarters : \\n\\nFresh Diver Scallop Skewer with green bell pepper, sweet onion & couscous- the skewer had some of the most fresh and sweet scallops I\\'ve had since moving to Vegas. It leads me to believe they weren\\'t pre packaged , but fresh shucked as that\\'s the only time I\\'ve had as superior of a scallop.   The preparation was very simple but it showed off the quality well. \\n\\nGrilled Mediterranean Octopus ($10 supplement) - this was worth the supplement. It was tender, the char was strong but was a nice flavor with the onions, caper and simple lemon, olive oil and sea salt. Th\\ne BF normally doesn\\'t like octopus because in his mind the texture is too rubbery but he enjoyed this. \\n\\nMain: \\n\\nWe both got the Lavraki/ grilled Mediterranean bass - It\\'s a whole fish that just needed some of the lemon and that\\'s it. They buttferfly it and debone except the collar and keep the head, skin on so keep in mind for people who only eat foods that don\\'t resemble the animal they are. I happen to love that they chose to keep it  The flavor was a bit sweet, ocean-y in the right ways. It comes with a few broccoli stems and I thought I would need some sort of starch but I didn\\'t. I had a bit of the bread left and that was enough and didn\\'t take away from the fish. I even convinced my BF to try eating pieces of its face and eyes since it was fresh. Hah.  If you love sea bass like we do then this will make you very happy.  \\n\\nDessert: \\n\\nWalnut Pie with Kaimaki ice cream - With the description and even the look of the walnut cake I thought it was gonna be rich, warm and buttery and i\\nt was not. It took a whole unexpected crumbly texture and was served cold. The kaimaki isn\\'t a ice cream I see often and it was nice to see a very Greek thing on the menu. Oddly, this is a refreshing dessert because of the texture and coolness and our other dessert that I thought was going to be light was the rich one.  \\n\\nYogurt Martini - this was rich and lovely. It is not like store Greek yogurt if that is what you are expecting but it\\'s almost like a very soft cheese consistency. The berry syrup with it gave the right amount of tang. \\n\\nIt seems like the portions would make for a skimpy meal, but we were happily full.\\n\\nThe service was good, courteous, attentive and unobtrusive the way a high end restaurant should be. From our app to main there was a bit of a wait so maybe our fish went to someone else, but they definitely checked on us, apologized for the wait, brought us out more bread and got it to us cooked perfectly. I do not mind waiting for food that is delicious.\\n\\nThis is a ve\\nry solid dinner and I feel a \"must do\" on the strip. If you love humble meals that show off the natural flavors of things then this place will impress in freshness. I will definitely be doing this again when family is in town.\\nHungry and in a odd area visiting a friend late at night, we stopped in for some noms. We\\'ve been in the same situation before and remembered it being good the last few times we got food here. \\n\\nThis time the BF got a California burrito and I got a carnitas burrito. It was pretty good flavor and there wasn\\'t odd chewy or dry spots, only nice and juicy meat. Only \"bad\" thing about it was it needed a tad more seasoning on the meat as adding tad of salt brought the meat out. The guacamole and salsa was fresh tasting which can be a bit shaky with some of these late night Mexican food places. Their burritos are also on the heavy side- more generous with the filling than most. \\n\\nIt\\'s definitely fresher tasting and seems a bit more consistent in quality and flavor than ', 'actual_label': 43, 'predicted_label': 43}, {'text': 'Robertos and other late night Mexican.\\nIt\\'s been a while since the whole debacle of feeling sick and I\\'ve been getting a bunch of deli items again and have not had issues since. I like getting the various pancakes specially the mung bean, chive, and seafood pancakes, the braised fishcakes, and various kimchee. \\n\\nI like shopping here as it\\'s clean, convenient from work and has all the Korean staples and basic Asian staple items. The prices on vegetables and fruit is pretty reasonable, though sometimes the quality is hit or miss, but generally more good than bad. Only thing I don\\'t really buy here is meat. They carry mostly sliced meats for bbq. I do sometimes get their marinated meats. Their fish selection is small compared to other Asian markets, but generally pretty fresh and the area doesn\\'t stink of fish just because it\\'s there. It\\'s always nice smelling in here. \\n\\nOf course the bonus is the food court and various other businesses all in the same building. Eat, shop, go to the post \\noffice kiosk is often a routine of mine.\\nI won a certificate for a stay at Silverton and dinner at Twin Creeks last year and lost the certificate. Upon cleaning out old bills and junk mail I found it stuck to something and glad to see we had a few weeks before it expired! We did our staycation on a Fri/Sat. during the Asian Fest weekend so the property was a little bit busier than usual.\\n\\nWe stayed in a luxury king room which was more contemporary than I thought this place would be. The bed was surprisingly comfy and soft when most places tend to go for firm mattresses since they last longer. Shower had one of those oversized shower heads and had awesome water pressure for a hotel. A plus is that there is a empty mini fridge you can actually use and not stocked with just items for you to buy. The A/C seemed to be struggling to get cold though. We don\\'t keep our house icy, but it didn\\'t feel like it was gonna ever get to less than 75* so test your room before bedtime if you really are a\\n person who cannot sleep without it being cold. There is a free wi-fi which is good enough for basic browsing but they also offer high speed, which I thought was a bit pricey at $10 a day, pretty sure it is separate from your resort fee. The one big gripe about this property is the cellphone reception royally sucks (at least for Sprint). There was spotty reception in our room, it was hard to get a consistent signal on the casino floor where it took me 10 minutes to find a spot to make a call, it was absolutely dead when I was in Twin Creeks. They need repeaters inside. I think this is basic and necessary. \\n\\nThe front desk staff was fairly friendly and got us checked in/out fast. Staff around the property was friendly. We didn\\'t have a big problem except before leaving. We asked for late check-out the night before for 1pm and I don\\'t think the lady put it into the system, or the staff doesnt communicate well, or housekeeping doesn\\'t care and want to try to jar people to get out by breat\\nhing on them a little. We had someone banging at 12:10 pm. I was getting changed, they knocked really light with a key or something fast (don\\'t do that, people can\\'t hear it well and not sure if that\\'s a person knocking or a wall sound) and then OPENED THE DOOR.\\n\\n I ran to it like a banchee out of hell in my shirt with no bottoms on yet to hit the door and get behind it to peek my head out. I should have been given way more time to answer the door or someone yelling they\\'re staff and not just knocking half assed with a key. He doesn\\'t say anything, just tries to open the door until he sees me. He just asks \"what time you leave?\"... No introduction, no hello, no apology for bothering or attempting to enter.  Then when I told him we had asked and gotten late checkout he went \"oh\" and walked off. \\n\\nThe BF works in the industry and he says they are not allowed to do that when you have a \"Do Not Disturb\", you cannot enter someones suite without them inviting you and they only call people ne\\nver knock at their door for questions like that. At least on his property they are far stricter on etiquette on knocking and entering but I think they SHOULD. Someones suite is their private space for their stay and you don\\'t know what they\\'re doing. I was pretty annoyed and I really hope this isn\\'t a regular thing. What if I was in the shower? You walk in and knock on the bathroom door? It\\'s highly inappropriate. \\n\\nI would say my stay was good, until that point. That one person alone, a Filipino guy, probably the housekeeping manager, walking around with a paper checking on check outs really soured a surprisingly decent stay. \\n\\nReviews of businesses within the casino, I\\'m doing separate but overall the property itself I like, I love Twin Creeks, room was comfy, but I will not be staying here again for a staycation.\\nMatthew probably missed the classy wannabe strippers that graced the poles last night. Entertaining since you can tell they were trying to eat up attention and one up each ', 'actual_label': 43, 'predicted_label': 29}, {'text': 'other. One bitch does a trick, the next one wants to climb to the fucking roof and drop down backwards. If only the same kind of payment (attention) works at strip clubs, I might frequent them or come here for amateur night. \\n\\nI think the key thing for me was I was NOT feeling the music. The BF and I are music lovers and he DJs so we know we are nitpicky bitches, but c\\'mon he\\'s getting paid for a subpar job. Fool, I dont even know half of what\\'s in our music room, but I know when it\\'s not mixing right. He botched my favorite song of the night- Steve Aoki\\'s remix of Kid Kudi- Pursuit of Happiness....Mixed out before the best part and mixed into some odd sample saying \"In Da House\" before quick mixing/botching into another Steve Aoki song \"with Zuper Blahq (It\\'s WIll.I.Am in a black outfit and mask)  called I\\'m In Da House. Duddee... you do know Steve is the resident here on Fridays, right? Do his songs a justice!\\n\\nEncore Beach Club is gorgeous so I will just sit outside cuz I\\'m not feel\\ning the decor inside Surrender. I thought with the apple and snake it was going to be a lush oasis, Adam&Eve kinda Utopia that opens up to a beautiful pool. I just think they could have thought out the decor better and made it mesh more with the Beach Club because to me, doesn\\'t make too much sense. Soft pinks and oranges outside and then dark heavy golds and crimsons in here?  It didn\\'t look like \"Surrender\" lushness I imagined, looks more like snake themed titty bar with the abundance of poles. \\n\\nI will however be back for Steve Aoki. He is the homeboy from LA, the Dim Mak Man so I\\'ll give you a three simply since he\\'s the resident on Fridays.\\nDined here for my friends 21st birthday dinner. Now, my friend takes forever to get ready and never can get anywhere on time- I think her moving around the reservations TWICE cuz she\\'s not done with her hours long grooming ritual made the hostess upset. When we got there, the original was for outside and I was not feeling well so we were trying\\n to sit inside instead. Hostess was definitely not friendly when she told us no. Given its probably annoying that we moved our reservation, but still you don\\'t need to look so gravely annoyed. \\n\\nSo outside we went and I just hope for the best out of dinner. Thankfully it started to cool down as we sat there but I still had to go to the bathroom and make a cold compress.  Bread basket is good, but wtf is up with cold, just taken out of the fridge bread? They had a loaf that I loved, cranberry and bacon, but they really should ask people if they want it or not. We had someone in our table that cannot eat pork- a Muslim and also a vegetarian and they both bit into it thinking it\\'s just cranberries and had to spit it out. (More for me!!) There was also a pretzel roll and a few slices of different wheat, sour, etc with two kinds of seasoned butter with a bit of oil on top: herb& oil and chili flakes&oil.\\n\\nMy friend grabbed some calamari for the table. It came with a few fried green beans an\\nd fried lemon slices (eat them- its actually good and not too tart) with a creamy curry sauce. The calamari was fresh though I would like more seasoning in the batter, it needed sauce. Maybe I\\'m just setting myself up to be disappointed since I love/crave the calamari at Herbs&Rye that is so flavor packed. \\n\\nBF and I wanted to share two things- a lamb bolognese tagliatelle with truffled riccota and a crab ravioli with cream sauce, peas, grape tomatoes and crimini mushrooms. Bolognese was very rich, but delicious. Definitely glad we chose to share so it can break up the flavor. I would normally love this thoroughly, but I\\'m sick (throat&ear infection, severe congestion, fever and nausea caused by the ear infection) so I needed something to lighten it. The flavorings and the use of pieces of lamb shank reminds me of osso bucco or a lamb tagine so great for fans of those dishes. The crab ravioli was generously stuffed with crab and was very fresh. we loved the combo of the flavors of this\\n- good balance of some sweetness from a wine base and peas, some creaminess, richness of crimini and some fresh flavors with the herbs and fresh cut cherry tomatoes. My friend had a Mediterranean sea bass with a mix of squash and other veggies and her BF had skirt steak with sweet potato fries. They seemed to be very satisfied with their meal. We skipped dessert since we needed to drop them off to the strip, but looked good. \\n\\nIt was rather busy as our dinner went on. Service was okay, but not very attentive....we had to wait a while for a refill and sat a while to be noticed that our plates are done and we need the check.  We weren\\'t neglected, but it wasn\\'t the best. To me, it seemed that the guy was so busy though seeing him bustling about so maybe it means the establishment is spreading their staff too thin by giving them too many tables. \\n\\nOverall, we had a satisfying meal. I don\\'t know if I\\'d come often because of the dinner prices isn\\'t the most affordable to someone with piles ', 'actual_label': 43, 'predicted_label': 43}, {'text': 'of bills, but I think it\\'s more of a place I\\'d come for drinks&appetizers or lunch. I do enjoy the atmosphere and maybe coming earlier would be a quieter, more attentive experience.\\nCame for a after dinner treat with the BF and cousin based on the positive reviews. \\n\\nI ordered a hot almond milk tea (tiny surcharge for hot over iced) with boba. It was a pretty solid hot milk tea and their boba had a good chew and sweetness to it. The BF wanted a shave ice and grabbed the mixed fruit which had mangoes, watermelon, kiwi, strawberry, bananas in it,  topped with condense milk and we added a scoop of ice cream. This was okay, it was plentiful but I think next time some red bean would be good with it to add some richness and texture. Prices are reasonable here for what you get.\\n\\nIt\\'s casual counter service, but they are pretty friendly here.\\n\\nThere\\'s wifi, k-pop on the TV and usually I like to think of cafes a place to stay a while but their seats are just typical wood seats. Not uncomfortabl\\ne right off, but not something I want to sit on and do some work either. \\n\\nI\\'d come back again for a drink.\\nThese are of the foodcourt booths. See my previous review for the actual markets review. \\n*****\\nIsland Style\\n\\nI went to the Island Style booth, same owners as the Island Style that is on Sahara and Valley view. \\nI had #2 Bibimdaemyeun- cold buckwheat noodles in a spicy sauce with sliced pickled radishes and cucumber, brisket and a hardboiled egg. they have me two banchan of cabbage and a radish kimchee and a bowl of broth, seaweed I think. All that and a Hawaiian Sun Lillikoi can for $10. It was delicious- this is one of my favorite Korean dishes specially on a hot day. Actually cools you down quite a bit while heating you up with the chili! Chewy buckwheat and crisp veggies is such a great texture combo too. Island flavor also gives you complimentary, serve yourself barley tea and water. It\\'s great for when I eat spicy- I\\'m drinking up cups in a single gulp! \\n\\nWill be eating at \\nthis food court quite often since I work close by now. Other than Island Flavor there is a Noodle Village, Chapaghetti, namyriang. 3 more booths are coming soon. The court also has L\\'Epidor Bakery, a cellphone place, a clothing store and a Korean cosmetics place.\\n\\n*****\\nMr. Colorfood 6/25\\nI tried another booth, the most recently opened Mr. Colorfood. Got to-go order of \"Happy Pig Pork and Squid\" which comes in a spicy sauce and they gave me a side order of a miso soup, spicy pickled radish and sweet vinegar pickled radish and cucumbers for $10.50. It was a bit disappointing....usually this dish comes in a thick spicy paste and this was more watery. It also had this herb that is okay in some dishes, but I don\\'t know if I like it in this and the squid had an odd texture...it was soft in a way that the outside of it was brittle/mushy that I can\\'t really describe. I dunno, but I\\'m not sure about this booth....3 stars for that.\\n\\n*****\\nIsland Style 7/1\\n Got beef bimbimbap from Island Style..\\n..yummy and generously sized! Lots and Lots of veggies (garlic spinach!, carrots), pickles (radish) and banchan (kimchee and radish on the side). I could not finish so I saved the rest for later. Still my favorite booth- 5 stars\\n\\n*****\\nChapaghetti 7/16\\nI got jajangmyun which is black bean paste noodles. It has in it egg noodles, zucchini, cabbage, potato, onion and diced pork. It was pretty good, the sauce was savory (some places make it too sweet). There was mostly onions, with a little more meat/veggie and a thicker sauce it would be absolutely perfect. 4 stars.\\n\\n****\\nIsland Style 8/11\\nGot their meat jun- pretty decent! Comes with cabbage kimchee and macaroni salad. I like this place a lot.\\n\\n***\\nL\\'Epidor Bakery 8/24\\nGot honey layer cake- was pretty good. I would need to try more...I noticed their bags were Providence Bakery bags....so even though they\\'re sort\\'ve different I assume this, Crown and Providence are related somehow. Will confirm this bit of info soon. 4 stars\\n\\nUPDATE 8/25\\n- SO we tried to finish the Honey layer cake today and found EGGSHELL in it. WTF?! This also happened at Crown which we wonder if they are affiliated then it\\'s the same person baking eggshells into the cake?!! Lets put that it\\'s 3 stars since now I\\'m cautious even though it was a good cake.\\n****\\nIsland Style 8/25\\nGot Chicken Teriyaki to go. Nice flavors, good char, but needed a sauce. I dont know if it usually has one and they forgot to include a cup of it One thing that was off though was the macaroni- it was frozen and the parts that  were not was a yucky texture since it defrosted. 3 stars. \\n***\\nNoodle Village 9/7\\nGot the \"spicy noodles with vegetable\". It is very like my favorite Bibimdaemyeun but the noodles are thicker (spaghetti width) and has sliced cucumbers, cabbage, carrots, and half a hardboiled egg. They give you some daan moo ji/ sweetyellow pickled radish on the side. 4 stars. \\nJust a note- Mr. Colorfood and Namyriang are now CLOSED. Tiffany Coffee will have a frozen yog', 'actual_label': 43, 'predicted_label': 4}, {'text': 'urt booth coming soon.\\n***\\nI Love Oishi 10/6\\n\\nThis is the newest booth  in the food court.I got their Korean Style Jirashi bowl to go. It has mixed diced fish (tuna, salmon, and snapper it looked like), some masago roe, mixed greens, rice and spicy bean paste. They also give you miso soup with it. This was a lot better than the premade ones in the greenland deli since it\\'s fresh made. The fish and greens were all fresh and for $7.99 it was a good portion of food. 4 stars.\\n\\nJust a note- Mr. Colorfoods old booth has a sign for \"School Food\" coming soon....what an odd name! Curious to see what the food is like.\\n***\\nI Love Oishi 10/26\\n\\nSushi and Sashimi Bento $9.99 It had salmon sashimi, 4pc nigiri (shrimp. tuna, white fish, salmon) , grilled salmon collar, salad, potato crochette and miso soup. It\\'s a good light lunch. The salmon was very fresh but the other sushi is just ok. The grilled collar was great. I rather have rice than the crochette though. 3 stars. I still think the Korean Jira\\nshi is the dish to get here.\\n***\\nThe BF had a craving for late night dim sum and so I went on a search to find who serves even a small selection throughout the day. \\n\\nIt\\'s not on the dinner menu, but I was told you can order dimsum from the kitchen late night for $2.88 each. The selection is limited and depends on what didn\\'t sell that morning. Hey, it\\'s better than nothing....the only late night dimsum (Kan\\'s) closed. \\n\\nWe ended up getting:\\n\\nShrimp Har Gao- the shrimp and wrapper was fine, but I think the wrapper is slightly too thick.\\nShumai- I did not like their version. Something about the taste just doesn\\'t work for me and was just OK. \\nShrimp cake- these were tasty. They were panfried so it was crisp and inside was dense cake, shrimp and green onion. \\n\\nWe also got off the menu:\\n\\nMapo Tofu ($7.95)- pretty good. The meat had a sausage like flavor to it which was interesting since most just throw plain ground meat. Tofu is always noms to me.\\n\\nSalt&Pepper Pork Chop ($9.95)- the fry w\\nas light so the texture was nice. Funny that \"salt\" is part of the name, but it needed a tad more of that. \\n\\nI was surprised by the prices. I honestly thought it would be more at a casino, but it\\'s about the same pricing as some of the nicer Chinese restaurant on Spring Mountain Rd. I think it was very fair priced and the quality was good. \\n\\nThe service was friendly and pretty on it with drinks and checking up on us. \\n\\nWill be coming back for daytime dimsum....one of these days we\\'ll actually wake up early enough for it.\\nBasically Hobby Lobby is if a craft store had a baby with a home decor store. I went here because I need all to see my options of stuff for my DIY wedding projects. \\n\\nI found a few stems of paper leaves that were cool and a list of stuff that were possibilities if I didn\\'t find something cheaper. Don\\'t forget your coupons! I feel that the prices of certain things are a bit high and the 40% off one item coupon helps take it down to a acceptable level. There was a geomet\\nric shape table knick knack I thought was modern cool, but the sticker of $70 for a damn thing made out of thin metal rods is ridiculous. \\n\\nThis is the spot though for painting supplies as their prices are better than most shops, for beads, for silk florals and if youre into all those signs with quotes and words, they are everywhere in the store.\\nTheir rice game here is ridiculous. \\n\\nMy BFs grandma grew up in Indonesia and that cuisine isn\\'t really available anywhere, but Malaysia shares many similarities so we thought to bring her here. She ended up not coming, but the BF,my MIL and I went. I kinda know a bit about Malay food, but they have a picture menu binder they give people as well as a regular text menu which was helpful. \\n\\nWe ordered: \\n\\nBBQ Pork fried rice - it had really nice flavor, the bbq pork was sweet and succulent and the rice was really soft and fluffy, not greasy at all. My only critique about this is that it had large slices of red onion which would have been okay wel\\nl cooked, but it was a bit raw.\\n\\nRendang Ayam- I\\'m a big fan of the bold thick rendang and this one was definitely hitting the mark in flavor. This is a bone- in, skin on chicken so it was more flavorful with that, but it makes it a bit messy to eat. The portion was about half a chicken so they give you a sizable amount. I will be ordering this again, but with a red meat as I think that holds rendang flavors well. \\n\\nCaptains Noodles - we got it w/o shrimp for the MIL but it was still good. These are saucy noodles, swimming in a sweet soy based sauce which was good but maybe a bit sweet for me. \\n\\nOne thing I oddly have to rave about is their rice. Their fried rice and plain white rice was so soft and fluffy and well seasoned. It\\'s harder to achieve than you would think to hit that mark, but I love it when I could find it. I only keep brown rice at home now, so it\\'s a rare treat to find good white rice when eating out. \\n\\nThis is a halal place and so the meats reflect that. The chicken wi', 'actual_label': 43, 'predicted_label': 27}, {'text': 'll be more \"chicken-y\" as this isn\\'t your big farm mass produced usual chicken. \\n\\nWe ordered grandma food to-go. Chicken satay was rather small, but decent enough. It is really sweet though so we did a bit like \"thai style\" and dip a little vinegar onto them to balance it out. She wanted kari ayam curry but with fried tofu and they accommodated it for us. It was alright, rather tangy of a curry. I wasn\\'t a fan and neither was she though, but it might just not be in our taste. \\n\\nService was decent here. Our drinks were refilled before they got were empty. \\n\\nNow I want more fluffy rice.\\nWe recently fell into an affair with Indian food. If they cook it, we have/will eaten/eat there! It led to a search of cookbooks with many spices I had no clue where to find locally. A little search on Yelp popped up this little gem that meets both my eating and cooking wants! \\n\\nThe BF and I ate at the food booth in the back and shared a  vegetarian thali (comes with 2 dishes-among several choices, dal, r\\nice, pickles, 2 bread:$5.99), samosa chat (I believe $3.99) and a paneer stuffed paratha w/ yogurt ($2.99). It was plenty of food for two and all very nice. I am a big fan of the samosa chat here though. The chutneys were fresh and vibrant and kept me going for more. There is a water cooler and a hot tea dispenser that is complimentary but there is also various drinks in the fridge area. If you\\'re in the area and want a tasty snack or a nice veggie meal, definitely drop in. \\n\\nGrocery side has everything we were looking for! They have also some more common spices that I decided to get here as the prices are really good. For example, I almost bought a $6 jar of cinnamon sticks at the grocery and it\\'s $1.99 for the same amount here. A nice sized jar of spices start are mostly about $1.99 with the harder to find spices like green cardamom pods are around $4, very few are over that. For those who need spices in mass quantities, they have huge value bags as well and they seem to be a better \\ndeal than buying at Sams/Costco. I also hoped I can find some fresh herbs and they indeed had fresh curry leaves and fresh fenugreek. If you\\'re not into the cooking stuff, there are plenty of tasty and interesting looking snacks and prepared packs of food. We bought a few heat and eat packets and some were good and some not. I suppose it\\'s hit and miss, but hey, it\\'s packet food and isn\\'t anything like the fresh. \\n\\nEat, cook and be merry!\\nOno Grinds and Hawaiian hospitality from Russell and his wife (didn\\'t get her name). \\n\\nI love the food booth in Greenland but haven\\'t made the stop to the OG location. What better than to go with the Yelp crew and have some Yelpalicious Dishes. Everything people ordered looked good. \\n\\nI got a pork cutlet so I can try out some of their gravy. It\\'s all about the gravy and a weak gravy makes for a okay dish. The gravy here was good on my katsu.  I was eyeing Misti Y.\\'s soup since she looked like she was enjoying it. Then like as if Russell reads minds, h\\ne brought us over a kimchee soup to try- that was pretty good and I gotta order that sometime when I\\'m feeling like soupy. The peanuts and banchans they served were also fresh and definitely tasted homemade. \\n\\nThey have more dishes here offered than their food booth so I will definitely stop by to try those dishes. Mahalo!\\nThe family has been planning to come back since our visit Mothers Day.  I figured since I\\'ve been twice in a row this week, I should write a update.\\n\\nI planned to have lunch with my mom and grandma in law and they were suggesting to come back. They wanted the Stir Fried Linguini and Massaman again. This was definitely a test in consistency and it was right on and just as good. This time the massaman had avocado pieces which made it even better for me! I also tried the Chicken Tom Khar. Lisa (chef/owner) came and said it wasn\\'t coming out the way she wants with consistency since she changed and tried a different coconut milk. I thought it was still good as the flavor \\nof the spices came through and made up for a lack of creaminess from the coconut milk. \\n\\nI guess the BF felt shafted we went without him so we went for lunch the very next day. We had pork pad se ew which had a great flavor. The noodles were a little sticky, but I rather like sticky noodles than the usually greasy treatment of this dish at other places. We got chicken red curry. This is different than most reds I\\'ve had, less thick and a bit more watery but the flavor is much more complex. I loved the addition of eggplant and squash to this dish as those went well with the curry flavor. I love meat, but I equally love vegetables that are fresh so it\\'s a big plus for me that the curries here isn\\'t all sauce and meat. The BF and I had a good talk with Lisa about her food and a bit about their past restaurants and such. I loved that she said that since they don\\'t have overhead they spend it on proper good ingredients because it\\'s about the customers. That good food needs good ingredients ', 'actual_label': 43, 'predicted_label': 43}, {'text': 'to become a superior dish. If only every single business adopted that instead of cutting corners on ingredients they might have solid dishes and avid fanbases! And it\\'s not like she is just saying that....we can see her cook and I see that their ingredients are quality (like our Thai Tea had organic Horizon milk) and fresh (herbs from their garden, fresh kefir instead of dried they obtain from LA, Melissa\\'s produce). Considering the quality for the price, it is a steal of a meal! Many places charge about this much for much less quality.\\n\\n I LOVE this place! It feels so comfortable to dine here with how friendly they are. It\\'s like being in the Wong\\'s home. \\n\\nThis is THE BEST Thai food I\\'ve had in the city and reminds me of some great Thai food giants in Los Angeles (if you didn\\'t know- has the largest population of Thai in the US) solid Thai home cooking. I thought Thai Grill solved all my Thai food answers here in Vegas, but I think this has definitely bumped to my number one.  I rare\\nly endorse a place this hard, but if you are gonna read any of my reviews and decide to go to a place, I hope I influence you to give this humble place a try.\\n\\n A small UYE coming soon so check the calendars!\\nI\\'ve never been to this park and wouldn\\'t have if it wasn\\'t for our potluck UYE being held here, but this is a very nice park. \\n\\nThere\\'s big areas of  grass that was actually green and a bit hilly, theres a pavilion with picnic area and also smaller one off around the park, a  playground with water features. There\\'s a easy hiking trail from here called Shoelace Mountain which is a a hike up to some wonderful views. I didn\\'t get to go up since we were here for the picnic. Trail originates from the oval walkway in the community park section or the other trail is on corner of Buffalo at Blue Diamond.\\n\\nThere was a event going on so we found one table in a far corner. If you are having a large picnic, I guess double check with the park. It seems like a popular and fairly busy park when\\n it was light. We were some of the few once the dark went though. Since there wasn\\'t enough room by our table a guard kept getting on us about being on a sidewalk by our table. There were bikers, walkers, etc but anytime we saw once we announced a clear for everyone. \\n\\nOverall nice park, and decent hiking option for nice city views.\\nYeah, I get lazy sometimes and normally don\\'t like fastfood, but Arby\\'s is alright.  I\\'m a fan for a few reasons:\\n\\n*I love their Market Fresh sandwiches, specially their chicken pecan salad. I can\\'t do the big greasy burgers at night before bed. \\n*I like Arby-Q\\'s and roast beef. \\n*I LOVE curly fries!  \\n*Surprisingly they have a decent cherry turnover and flavored teas.\\n*They have shakes, and have a small, kid cup size, option which is a plus since I can\\'t drink more than half a average sized shake. \\n*And they\\'re right by the house and open late (til 12 or 1).\\nI enjoyed the taco stand over near downtown so I was excited to go to a sitdown that was in a more \\nconvenient location for me to stop on the way home. \\n\\nMy first experience was so-so but I came near closing and the pastor wasn\\'t as good as it could be, but still decent. \\n\\nCame again in the middle of the day, and it was much, much better flavor and texture of the pastor. We also tried cabeza tacos which were pretty decent fine chop that wasnt too fatty.I also got a small \"plato de birria\" which isn\\'t so much a plate as a bowl of a soup broth with birria in it, plate of onions, cilantro and lime and tortillas on the side. It would have been better if the broth wasn\\'t close to room temperature and was actually hot. I think I\\'ll stick to tacos. \\n\\nTo sweeten the deal, Wednesday is 2 for 1 on pastor tacos - all day. It\\'s not advertised anywhere I stumbled upon it. \\n\\nThe thing that makes it a great spot to stop is the staff is really nice. They\\'ve been friendly even when it\\'s near closing and they insist we stay and eat than do to-go. I also like the ordering and paying system way better. \\nI am glad that despite their setup being for those \"express lines\" they nixed it so you can have all hot food, at once. \\n\\nThere\\'s some hiccups to be improved on with consistency, but so far to get some quick tacos in a indoor setup open til late, I am a fan.\\nWe heard that Metro did a pizza \"happy hour\" from 2:30-4:30 (Tue-Thur) where pizzas are half off so we decided to try it. \\n\\nYou are able to do half and half so we got half Patheon and half Piggy. Patheon was decent ingredients it was slightly bland and maybe needed seasoning on the toppings. Piggy was the opposite and was very flavorful with bbq sauce and pickles on it. Their crust was crispy, but is airier than.usual. \\n\\nService was decent. We were checked on and drinks refilled. \\n\\nOverall, it was decent at the half off price, but not a spot I would seek or frequent.\\nI went a few months ago for a late night food run. Going oooo I love Sam Woo to my BF thinking it was just like the ones in Cali. \\n\\nFirst off, they didn\\'t say cash onl', 'actual_label': 43, 'predicted_label': 43}, {'text': \"y except for a dinky sign....had to make the BF do a little ATM run. Ugh. All the other Sam Woos took card so I didn't think of it.\\n\\nThe Hot Pot of Eggplant pork and Salty Fish was actually pretty good in flavors and the right balance with the salty fish. I liked this a lot but the rest is so inconsistent. \\n\\nThe roast duck was a bit dry . I'm used to the fatty ones with plenty of juiciness... how does a fatty meat get dry? Granted it was a bit skinny....and usually half is plenty but it wasn't. I had to order some BBQ pork and it was dry like it was sliced this morning and left out. Boo. \\n\\n I have gone to Sam Woos in Cali and they are a good chain of restaurants there....did not hold very true here. First those SW take card. They are very clean and have good service. The food is consistently good and the place is usually housed in a big space and it actually fills up. One even gave nice hot desserts at the end for free like a bowl of sweet corn or taro with tapioca. I liked Sam Woo in \\nRowland Heights, Ca so much that I indeed was a 1-2 times a month regular with my mom. \\n\\nSorry, but Sam Woo will stay on my CALI repertoire but not here.\\nMy cousin is the buffet king and loves a bargain. Really his family are buffet people and they told me this is one of their favorites and had to take me. \\n\\nOkay so I go with my cousin for dinner and I was pleasantly surprised. There was some good prime rib and lamb roast at the carving table that was cooked perfectly. There was a beef in a wine sauce that was not bad at all, and in the back was a Hawaiian section which had kalua pork and oxtail stew that was surprisingly good. Collard greens and bbq chicken legs also were pretty good. \\n\\nI don't put much faith into buffets specially anything in the $10-15 range, but okay I can see why locals like this. It actually did have some food I thought was good. It isn't Wynn or Bellagio, but it's better than any lower priced buffet I've had so far. \\n\\nMom in Law and Gma like the buffets for prim\\ne rib and arent heavy eaters...I think I should try to bring them here as other spots, the only factor is the prime rib is decent and the rest is kinda blah (Station Casinos, Sams Town)....I can't ever justify having two people who eat like birds and really just eat prime rib to go to the Wynn with us. This buffet though, might make em happy.\\nI've been wanting to try this bakery, but we normally are not around these parts. We come for a friends housewarming which is very close by so we decided to bring treats for our hosts.\\n\\nWe decided on cupcakes so that we can get a bunch for the guests as well. There were 3 flavors so we got a dozen with several of each - chocolate, a vanilla with sprinkles and a cookies and cream. People seemed to like the cupcakes. I ate a cookies and cream and liked the frosting, but the cupcake could have been more moist for my taste. \\n\\nI love french macarons, so I had to try theirs. I liked the fact they had some lovely flavors, but the texture of it and propor\\ntions threw it off. It's large whoopie pie sized and so the thickness made the crisp outer layer a bit thick and inside was cakey. I really enjoyed the flavor of the fig and cheese though. Bigger isn't always better as it is the delicate play of textures that I love. It's not bad, it's just not a macaron in the French technique sense of the word. You may love this, but it was not for me.\\n\\nI think that theres probably some good treats here that are my preference, but so far what I've tried was just decent. I'll probably try some of the cakes in the fridge display next time I'm visiting the same friends in this area.\\nWhenever I get the impression of a dollar store, I don't often think there is a lot of stuff I would buy as I think in my head it's all janky imitation items that aren't any quality but exist for the super thrift who need a good value. I rather pay for a decent item than its cheap cousin which will break in a moment. \\n\\nI went in and to my surprise there is some good stuff mi\\nxed in with the busted. \\n\\nThe biggest prize for me is pet toys. I have a stuffie killer and one who sucks on tug ropes and makes them so slimy. My cats fishing pole toys often suffer a piranha attack- either my cat or one of my pugs will be so proud they bit the line through like an asshat. I tried getting them nice toys, chew resistant toys and it's a load of crap for these voracious monstors. Whether it's a nice toy or not, it's going to get busted and thrown away pretty fast in this house. Can't ever have nice things! I found some stuffies, ropes, cat stuffies and cat fishing pole. At $1, can't really be mad they had a few hours of entertainment destroying things. My cat has an obsession with bendy straws so I got him large packs of them and I just thew them in a pile in his room (yeah, our cat has a bedroom-don't laugh at me!) and he is currently bug eyed at the wonderment.\\n\\nI found random things that are useful like a lot of tupperware (including brand name ones) and plastic organ\", 'actual_label': 43, 'predicted_label': 43}, {'text': 'te.  I usually hit it up when it parks at the Element Uptown (next to Romeare Bearden Park - next to the 7-Eleven) on Tuesdays for lunch.  So great to have great food and to have a nice park to consume it in.\\n\\nYou pretty much can\\'t go wrong with anything on the menu.  I\\'ve had a little bit of everything and I have not been disappointed.  Their flavors pack a punch... and some heat (if you don\\'t mind the fresh peppers sliced into your sandwich, tacos, or rice bowl).   My favorite is the BBQ Pork....\\n\\nThe guys working the truck are super friendly and just sling out good food.  Luckily my lunch break is later than most folks so I hit them up around 1pm and there isn\\'t a line, but usually they have some war stories of the line stretching out really long, but I think with this new Tuesday stop, people are starting to figure out their schedules and staggering their visits.\\n\\nA number of beverages are available in a cooler: sodas and even asian drinks (which I have yet to try) maybe next time.\\n  Will always be looking out for the tan truck with a giant pac-man logo wearing an asian style conical hat.\\nSouthend barcade!!!!!  Woot woot!  Checked out Palmer St after work on a Thursday evening.  Super cool space with original arcade hardware.... all games are free to play with exception of the pinball machines that costs 50 cents.  I hear that they try to rotate out a couple games a month (they have some stashed in storage in the back) and also hope to expand maybe next year.... outdoor patio included in the plans.\\n\\nMajority local beers on draft... around 20 drafts to choose from.  They have eats too!  The bar is made from salvaged wood from the warehouse space as well as 372 cassette tapes that are set in resin.\\n\\nJust a really neat spot and space.  Old movies play in the background....a ton of cool memorabilia line the walls.  The tables in the back are made of old arcade game headers.\\n\\nStaff are super friendly and are willing to provide samples for the beers- also make recommen\\ndations. They just want you to hang out and have a good time.\\nI\\'ve never really regretted choosing to go to a fast food place, but this particular visit was definitely not the best.  I was actually circling South Park for a place to eat before heading to a meeting so it had to be quick... most of the places in this area are sit-down places and take a while so I stopped in here.\\n\\nThe people were friendly, but it took a long long time to get my food and then I decided to sit down and eat rather than stuff my face and run.  I did overhear a lot of employee conversations about going home and their feet hurting, etc.  I think they were in the middle of a shift change, but it\\'s hard not to hear that stuff when it\\'s being yelled from the cash register back to the kitchen.\\n\\nAtmosphere aside... the sandwich was dosed in mayo like someone was trying to put out a fire with it.  The fries.... were scalding hot (that\\'s what was the hold up with the food - and also the drive thru line).  They also r\\nan out of ketchup containers so I had to be creative and put ketchup on a napkin in a big blob.\\n\\nOh well - get what you pay for though I guess.....\\nOMG I still have dreams of my meal here at RM Seafood.  Super nice place, but not so high end that you need to wear a suit and tie to.  The servers are cordial and very knowledgeable to steer you in the right direction if you have no idea what to order - or you are on the fence about how much to order.\\n\\nLocated in Mandalay Bay Casino, it\\'s a great spot for celebrity chef Rick Moonen\\'s vision of a restaurant that supports sustainable fishing practices while having a unique dining experience.  Totally dug the clean modern lines and warm wood tones in the dining room.  We had a large party so we were sat at the larger tables that are partitioned by a curtain.... it was almost like a private room (until other parties started coming for dinner).  Still a great space and a great experience if you come to Vegas!\\n\\nI went with the \"Surf and Surf\" wh\\nich was one of the restaurants \"Best Sellers\" according to our server.  Shrimp and lobster placed over a bed of truffle butter risotto - it was so melt in your mouth and the shrimp and lobster cooked to perfection.  Some of my friends had the fresh Cobia special over mushrooms and fava beans.  My more daring friends ordered the seafood sampler which our waiter steered them away from ordering the largest \"Kitchen Sink\" which ended up being the right call.  We all left with full bellies and a great impression of the restaurant.\\nI will always have a special place in my heart for Boj...  That being said, it was really sad to see the location on the corner of Independence and Idlewild Rd get torn down, but it may have been a blessing since they got to build a much newer/better version a little bit down the road.\\n\\nSame old chicken goodness is still here... the only downside with all the Independence \"improvements\", this Bojangles is basically accessible to the outbound side of Independence B', 'actual_label': 44, 'predicted_label': 44}, {'text': 'lvd.  Once the bus lane is completed, you will probably have to make a bunch of U-turns and or travel on down the road to the next exchange to turn around and gain access.\\n\\nSeems like this new location is targeting the drive-thru crowd since there are less parking spaces than the other location, but it won\\'t be a problem since they are on the edge of that Kaplan school /formerly Circuit City that has plenty of parking.\\nOne of the last remaining Caribous in Charlotte, I\\'m glad this location is still here.  Super convenient to the Overstreet Mall, it\\'s located on the upper level in Founders Hall so it gets a lot of traffic.  I\\'d consider the space \"large\" in the uptown sense since there is a fireplace and a handful of tables and spots to sit in.  If you can\\'t find a spot to sit down, you can always bring your coffee or hot/cold beverage of choice out into the Founders Hall area (tables flank the upper level and there are benches and more tables in the lower area).\\n\\nService is quick and f\\nriendly.  I come here to find greeting cards (since they offer Papyrus cards here).  They also offer quick breakfast items here (until they run out.. which tends to happen a lot)... just small, quick sandwiches (pre-prepared and heated up) to go with your coffee.\\n\\nI\\'m not a coffee expert, but I do like coming here and getting their mocha on occassion.  I don\\'t really have an affinity to the \"other place\" with the green aprons, but it seems to me there are always lines at the other place no matter what time of day.  At least Caribou can keep their competitors honest by being here.\\nFinally made it to Bonterra... after some planning, we got a group together to go last night.   We were a large group of 7, so I had made reservations for a Thursday night on Monday morning of that week.  The OpenTable function of the website was a little mis-leading so I went ahead and called the restaurant direct and was able to get a table.\\n\\nEnvironment:  This former church setting of a restaurant makes for\\n a really unique space.  There was some sort of event going on in the main center of the room with carpet representatives... it was a little tempting to slap a name tag on since they had the wine and snacks flowing pretty well.  Other than the rambunctious carpet people, the tables are very well spaced - I hate it when tables are way too close together and you feel like you are on top of your neighbors.  Plain and elegant white table cloths with nothing too fancy on top that you are afraid to break or move.\\n\\nService:  Our server, Ramsey, was pretty good.  He explained the specials and also was very patient with us since the wine menu is pretty extensive and it took a while for all of us to make a decision on wines.  It was not fast at any means, but I found myself looking for our server since I was starving.  It ended up working out since we were in good company and wanted to catch up with a lot - weddings, vacations, and other life events that we all had experienced in the last couple\\n of weeks.\\n\\nFood:  I ended up ordering the Rib-eye which was amazing - it was accompanied by fingerling potatoes and a fig sauce.  Super satisfied.  I was also impressed with the bread basket (two types of bread) and a great olive oil for dunking.\\n\\nOverall the experience was good.  Definitely a \"special occasion\" type place but my friends and I vowed to come back just for some upscale drinking instead of doing the whole dinner - sit down exercise.   It will be nice to try their desserts too since they all sounded great.  We were all too full to indulge.\\nEver since my office moved up to the University area, this is my \"go to\" Y during the week.  Even though I missed the convenience of the Y\\'s downtown - Childress & Dowd, this one is a good replacement and it saves me from driving downtown for a workout.\\n\\nRecently I have picked up swimming in the mornings before work... well it\\'s better described as \"systematic drowning\".  The pool lifeguard is super friendly.  She was even giving me tip\\ns on my form.  If I think about it more I think she was \"concerned\" about me so... hence the tips.  I\\'ve got a ways to go before I am Michael Phelps, but I am glad the Univ City Y is helping me on my way to the Olympics (j/k).\\n\\nThis Y is as large as the other branches in the area and has lots of family programs - after school care, etc that you can take advantage of while getting your burn on.  Every thing is kept clean and maintained - the staff is there for you when you need them.\\n\\nThe parking lot leaves a little to be wanted, but it is functional (if people follow the one way signs).  At least the Y is off of a side street (not directly on WT Harris), but you have to time it right less you get caught in the traffic nightmare that happens there every rush hour twice a day.\\nStopped here for a quick beer.  Ended up having some of the Guinness battered onion rings, which were good.  It was a little dead, but it was still early after work, but the barkeep was nice and the service was pro', 'actual_label': 44, 'predicted_label': 44}, {'text': 'mpt.\\n\\nI\\'ll probably come back, the bar theme is nice.  I still remember when this place used to be another business, but the new owner really did it up big.\\nI only went in here to buy a gift.  Got in and out in 5min... the sales woman also helped me realized I could take advantage of a buy 2 get 1 free promotion so I didn\\'t miss out.  \\n\\nMost B&BWs assault your senses the second you walk in.  Maybe it\\'s just me being a guy, but it\\'s a little overwhelming to walk into one of these places.  I usually just hold my breath, run in... and get out.\\nWandered in here in search of a place that can change out a watch battery.  I was in luck that day, and I was in and out in less than 10 minutes with a working watch on my wrist!\\n\\nCost of the watch battery replacement was a little under $10... I think it was $8.99 plus the cost of the battery depending on the watch.  I did fail to ask how long the battery is good for, hopefully a long time but I am sure they will replace it if the battery is bad.\\n\\nW\\nalking around the store while they were working on my watch, there are a number of items of interest.  Batteries (of course) for everything but I was also surprised that they carry light bulbs.  Ranging from standard to CFL and LEDs there are a bunch of cool things to look at in the store as far as light bulbs go.  I can\\'t wait until LED\\'s are a little bit more affordable before changing out my entire house and you don\\'t have to worry about that mercury problem (CFL\\'s).\\n\\nThis location is a small store, but they pack a lot of small things - the staff is very friendly and helpful.  Very quick to replace watch batteries!\\nSo I am a fan of everything Duckworths:  beer selection, food, people... everything except the parking situation here.  Except for a couple of compact spaces and few regular spaces out in front, the parking lot here can be somewhat of a deathtrap.  I usually end up parking pretty far away depending on how much I want to risk my life that day, but I just hate having to dea\\nl with the overflow from Montford Dr.... regardless... the parking situation isn\\'t changing anytime soon, so I just deal with it.  People PLEASE!  for the love of whatever you believe in, slow down and don\\'t hit pedestrians and other shoppers that have business here - it will not hurt you to wait another 30 seconds to get your latte or whatever it is you are zipping around the parking lot for.  I\\'ve had some near misses here.\\n\\nANYWAYS... once you survive the gauntlet traffic parking situation, you can rest easy (at least for a little bit)... have a drink to relax and let your blood-pressure recede to normal levels.\\n\\nThis place is usually packed - which is a good sign.  The food is solid - they have daily specials and their servers and staff are friendly and will get you what you are craving.  Pizza, beer, tacos... they have a wide range of food and rather extensive tap list.  If you go to the other Duckworth\\'s in the area, there\\'s an iPad you can see the latest tap list, but this locat\\nion is old skool and you gotta do it on paper.  You can also check out the website for the list which is pretty upated.  http://duckworths.com/beer-list/\\n\\nOverall a solid place to grab a beer/dinner after work.  Watch the parking lot though.\\nEnded up down here the other night... Rivergate is a pretty new shopping center with round-abouts galore.  This location is very clean and the people working here are pretty friendly.\\n\\nThe unique thing I saw with this location was a floating \"island\" where all the ketchup, napkins, straws, and anything else you need (minus the sauces) reside.  There is a fairly large dinging room with fresh flowers (the happened to be daffodils) on each table that is well maintained.\\nLately I\\'ve been mostly shipping paintings here and there, but I\\'ve used FedEx the last couple of times and haven\\'t been disappointed.  They have a great \"art\" box that secures the painting in place and suspends it so everything is as the way you intended your painting to be upon arriv\\nal.  The box itself is worth the cost, but sometimes the freight (depending on the destination) can get a bit pricey.  It\\'s nice that you can bring in your item and FedEx will worry about how to box it.\\n\\nThis location off of East Blvd seems to get a lot of business.  There is a small parking lot out front (maybe 4-5 spaces) but be careful pulling in since the driveway is a bit awkward.  If the front spaces are full, it\\'s better to park in the rear lot (there\\'s a door so you don\\'t have to walk all the way around the building).\\n\\nDepending on your project, this location is open 24 hrs... if you are shipping something, be sure to check the drop-off times... for ground shipping I think it\\'s 6pm.  Lots of computer workstations to access the internet or finish up work - the store is usually pretty quiet aside from the people coming and going, but I would think it\\'s pretty easy to concentrate in here.\\nSo I think these guys are still fine tuning (since they really just opened not that long ago)', 'actual_label': 44, 'predicted_label': 44}, {'text': '.  I came in with a friend and was definitely a deer in headlights.  The young lady at the register was really nice and walked us through their concept and I asked a lot of questions about what is popular.\\n\\nI built my own penne pasta.  Chicken with Alfredo sauce.  It came out super fast (they weren\\'t that busy that night) and it was a large portion.  I think the meat cone is the way to go, and I will definitely be trying it during my next visit... along with some wine since I am within \"stumbling\" distance.\\n\\nThe space overall is clean and modern.  The concrete floors are lacquer-ed into the next century, and I noticed the chairs definitely slide very easily on the surface so be careful.  Some chairs even have castors on them (the ones with the arms) so it probably makes for a great transitional space for whatever the restaurant needs or for groups to move tables together, etc.\\n\\nThe store attached to the side of the restaurant (mostly wine) but there are some other products to purchase.\\n  They didn\\'t have any prices on the wall so I\\'ll have to come in again to see what their price-point is.\\n\\nI think the big draw to this place is the definitely going to be the self-serve wine bar.  With all the stuff going in on Camden, FK should fit very well as far as giving folks just another option... fast-causal dining in the area.\\nI have to admit, every time I pass a King Of Pops cooler with rainbow umbrella, it\\'s hard for me not to smile.  These guys have been bringing awesome pops to Charlotte for a while now providing fresh, all-natural frozen treats.\\n\\nThe stand I most frequently see is next to JJ Red Hots on East BLVD, but you can usually find them at major events - Food Truck Friday is a good example or stalk.... I mean follow them through their website:  http://charlotte.kingofpops.net/find_us\\n\\nThe cart(s) always have a nice chalkboard sign that has the flavors they are offering at that particular moment.  My favorite thing is seeing things crossed out - why?  cause it mean\\ns they are so popular that they are selling out them.... I suggest if you see a cart and are \"on the fence\" about getting one, go ahead and get one before they are gone!\\n\\nSometimes at special events, the guys from King of Pops create special flavors.  There was a Bacon, Beer & BBQ event at JJs where they collaborated on a bacon, chocolate, sea salt, cayenne pop - calling it a \"JJ\\'s Red Pop\".  I love local collaborations and adventurous eating.\\n\\nThere is nothing better than having a nice cold treat on a hot summer day.  Especially this current summer of heat and humidity, these guys are providing a much needed service to the community.\\nMight not be the easiest location to visit or see, but it\\'s a good option because of the people that work here.  Tucked away across a parking lot and underneath an overhand is this Showmars location, but there are a lot of regulars that frequent this place.  The servers and folks running the register are super nice and they recognize you, call you by name\\n, and ask how your work day is going.\\n\\nI take my lunch around 1pm so WAY after the lunch rush, but I can imagine this place being super busy.  There are a lot of tables and booths to sit at and the food comes out fast - with daily specials.\\n\\nSuper affordable and predictable, you can have you food in front of you pretty quickly - especially if you are trying to do a quick lunch.\\n\\nNow, this place is pretty practical if you work Uptown and can walk here for lunch.  Probably not a place to drive to since you would have to pay for parking somewhere... even if you park on the street at a metered spot.\\nI had always seen this food truck outside of my office on Wednesdays, but never really gave it  a second look or even considered the menu.... MAN was I missing out!!!  Its got a unique menu of eats that will satisfy anyone\\'s hunger (and curiosity!).\\n\\nSo I will have to admit, I had brought my lunch to the office, but apparently my portioning was off since I was still hungry by the time I had fin\\nished.  I looked outside and saw the food truck and thought to supplement my lunch with a side from the truck.  Little did I know, I was blown away by the menu.  Ended up trying the Cheese & Herb Risotto Fritters w/ Fire Roasted Pepper & Arugula Aioli.  YUMMMMMM!  It is a mouthful of a description, but the flavor and satisfaction after eating them was even more so!\\n\\nGoing to have to try their regular menu items.... The Kimchi ramen Grilled Cheese looks very promising as does the Reuben.  The other unique part of this truck is their sweet selection:  cookies... they are 3 for $2 and you get to choose from Spicy Dark Chocolate Oatmeal, Lemon Sugar, and Orange Cranberry Almond Cookies.\\n\\nNext time I see this food truck, I will be thrown\\' some bows to get to the front of the line and placing my order.\\nThis gas station is close to my house and very convenient.  It\\'s located at (not that close to the corner) Lawyers and Steven\\'s Mill.  I don\\'t know how the CVS got top billing at that corner, ', 'actual_label': 44, 'predicted_label': 44}, {'text': 'but it\\'s not that much farther to get into the gas station off of Lawyers Rd.  \\n\\nThe pumps are kept tidy and in good working order.  I never have to go into the station since I pay at the pump most times.\\n\\nNever really crowded or sparse, but a steady flow of customers as the price of gas is usually comparable (if not lower) than the Charlotte average.  It is the only gas station within a mile - no competition, but from what I have seen they have not jacked up their prices with their location or no compeition advantage.\\nStaff is super friendly and the location is great.  Makes for a nice cozy stop or get away if u are looking to read or study. Or even meet with someone.\\n\\nI\\'m not a huge fan of the parking lot.... but I am now a huge fan of their spicy hot chocolate. Make sure you get it in dark!\\n\\nThere are limited tables here but there looks to be plenty of outlets to use near the walls..... scratch that.... not that many but since its not busy does not seem like people are giving me the\\n evil eye if I\\'m sitting next to an outlet and not using it.\\nBeen a while since my last Fox & Hound experience so I was pretty stoked for trying the new location (to me) at Northlake.  It is a bit of a haul for me but peer pressure prevailed and I ended up having a decent time here.\\n\\nOur server, Meghan was super nice and friendly.  It did get a bit busy with the Panthers game on a Thursday night - also simultaneous trivia on the same night made for an interesting time.  We didn\\'t stay for trivia but I would have been a little peeved since the game sound was interrupted by the shrill, way-to-excited voice of the woman who runs trivia.\\n\\nAtmosphere is similar to a lot of the other Fox & Hound locations in Charlotte:  dim with tvs all over the place.  The tables in here are very small!  The 4 top we were sitting at was totally full once all of us ordered drinks.   Then the food came out and it was a shuffling, puzzle match as far as finding places to set things.  It worked out though.\\n\\nFis\\nh & Chips came out for me with 3 huge, honking pieces of beer battered/fried goodness that a proceeded to scarf down like I had never eaten fish & chips before.  It was nice and crispy.  The fries that came with it were okay - slaw on the side wasn\\'t really anything to write home about.\\n\\nI\\'d say this is a solid hangout place if you live in the area.  Unfortunately for me, I had a nice lonely 40min drive home to Matthews, but I can see myself doing it occassionally.\\nNice little place tucked away in this shopping center.  Could get easily lost in the mix between the sports bars and other restaurants that are in the same complex.\\n\\nThe interior is nicely decorated - I really felt transported away from Charlotte.  I couldn\\'t tell you if it was authentic or not, but it felt nicely done.\\n\\nI had the Kang Masaman Curry which was delicious.  At medium heat, it gave just enough numbing to the lips that it was enjoyable and not painful.  My friends also split an order of fried pot stickers which w\\nere really good.\\n\\nOverall, had a good first experience here.  Wish I had found out about this place sooner - The service could use some ramping up (they weren\\'t really busy, but it seemed like our waitress took a while to come check on us and for refills).\\nThere\\'s a certain point in southeast Uptown where the restaurants start becoming few and far between.  The Showmars at the Government Center pretty much has a captive market due to it\\'s location and lack of restaurants surrounding.  I came during an off lunch time, but you can see the remains of the lunch crowd that pretty much destroys the restaurant (figuratively speaking).  You walk in, and there is a sign that explicitly says to form 3 lines and the cashiers will call you went its your turn.\\n\\nIf you are walking to the building, you will have to go through metal detectors since the building is a secure location.  It\\'s a little strange to feel like you need to go through security just to go to a restaurant, but hey, I get it.\\n\\nTypi\\ncal Showmars menu here...   items are made to order and are quickly to you after they give you a number tent and you find a table.  Since I came after the lunch rush the staff had closed of some table sections to clean, it was a little awkward when you got \"fenced in\" but easy enough to move a chair to go get a drink refill.\\nI usually visit this store if I\\'m looking for something pretty specific regarding clothing, housewares, or luggage.  It is actually not a bad store to visit... everything is kept pretty orderly and you can almost spend hours here if you are really shopping.  Having an older sister, I can locate the benches and places to sit at department stores pretty quickly... but Kohl\\'s has a good mix of guys and gals stuff so you can walk around and browse instead of finding a place to park your behind.\\n\\nSome of the items can tend to run on the expensive side, but they do have a good clearance rack and you can find deals (just have to take the time to look for them).\\n\\nEvery now', 'actual_label': 44, 'predicted_label': 44}, {'text': '-and-then the cashier line goes down the asile, but they do a pretty good job of keeping the line moving (most of the time).  I do have one semi-bad memory at this store where I thought it would be a great idea to get a couple of pillows on sale for Black Friday.  BAD IDEA.... everyone apparently had the same idea, if not more and I pretty much got elbowed by a grandma on a mission to get her Black Friday money\\'s worth.\\nTalk about unique and fun experiences.... Lumberjaxe really forced me out of my \"comfort zone,\" but it ended up being a really great time.\\n\\n*RECOMMEND* reserving your spot online - since this place is new and it would be hard to walk in and grab a play by the hour.  We were able to make a reservation about 2 weeks out (that\\'s how popular it is now) so plan ahead.  They required a deposit but the way it worked out, we had a group of six and I made the deposit (the deposit covered my share of the reservation) and then everyone else payed the day of.\\n\\nThis place shares the\\n same building as Cawtawba Brewing, so what we did was meet at Cawtabawa for some pre-axe-throwing drinks to loosen up the nerves and then we headed over early.\\n\\nYou can sign electronic waivers ahead of time to save time, but you can also sign them there.  Just remember that once the clock starts on your play time, there\\'s no extending it (if someone is late, people are still getting situated, etc).\\n\\nYou get paired with an Axe Coach.  Our groups Axe coach was Reggie and he went through safety, basic throwing techniques, and once we all took turns, he taught us how to play a game.  He aslo taught us a one-handed throwing technique and we were off to the running.\\n\\nThe place has it\\'s own bar... probably 6-7 taps and a refrigerator full of cans and bottles.\\n\\nOur hour went by so quick cause it was very fun, but we all had a good experience.  The staff could not have been nicer.  Will need to go back.. hopefully I did not catch an axe throwing bug, but my friend\\'s girl friend (also a pastor \\nat a church) was scarily good and hit the bullseye several times....\\n\\nNOTE:  Remember to wear close-toed shoes.  You can also bring spectators.... who also have to sign waivers and wear close-toed shoes even though they aren\\'t throwing.\\nHappy 1st Burstday Nikki!  It was great celebrating at a pretty awesome location.  I am still in AWE over your giant connect four game, but very fitting to pull out all the stops for your first \\'burstday.\\'  A year has flown by and it\\'s actually really fun to look back and remember all your events.\\n\\nThank you Pinky\\'s Westside Grill of Huntersville for hosting us elites.  There was no shortage of hospitality and food!  Seems like every time I had finished munching on all the yummy food that was brought out, there was another delicious  treat being set up on the table.  White trash sliders were so amazing, and believe it or not, that was my first experience with fried tofu and fried artichokes.\\n\\nThank you to Sierra Nevada for providing some tasty craft bre\\nws.  Always great paired with awesome food.  Also Thanks to Sailor Jerry and the drink that about kicked my butt (I\\'m a cheap date, but a good one none-the-less... well at least I hope).\\n\\nAlways great to see Tonya, snapping away.  I\\'m sure Poprock got some awesome shots of the event, food, and GIANT connect four action.\\n\\nGood to see some elite faces I haven\\'t seen in a while as well as meet some new folks like Michael N. who made the trek out from Shelby.  Definitely enjoyed hanging with you and reminding myself to maybe stay away from the fair this  year....\\n\\nOverall an awesome, fun evening..... Hopefully many more years of celebrating a great Yelp CM!\\nI do miss working downtown since this is a nice spot to get some after work beverages (or 10).  Very laid back, no frills atmosphere to this place with an eclectic menu so I am sure there is something everyone can find to eat here.  Location, helpful staff, and tasty food/drinks makes me give this place a solid 3 stars.\\nSo I used to be \\nan avid Papa John\\'s pizza order-er [especially fresh out of college], but my pizza ordering has died down a little.  It could be due to the fact that no body comes over to watch tv, games, etc - all part of getting older....\\n\\nTheir online ordering tool makes it super easy to get you what you want without any confusion and craziness.  I was pleasantly surprised to see the pizza would not come from the normal Matthews Papa John\\'s location, but one of the newer locations in downtown Mint Hill.  I am not sure how long this location has been opened, but it still is about equidistant, but good to know that there is more than one option to serve the area (and would probably reduce the wait time on your pie if there is a slew of orders that one location can\\'t handle alone).\\n\\nI will have to try to pick up from this place, but delivery is the way to go.  The driver was very prompt (even sooner delivery than what the confirmation email had predicted).  And I was enjoying my 3 topping, large pizza', 'actual_label': 44, 'predicted_label': 44}, {'text': '... which technically had 6 toppings (I usually split the pizza with half toppings for a little variety).\\n\\nNow don\\'t get me wrong... I would love to visit a local, mom and pop place for pizza, but PJ\\'s is definitely my go to for delivery.  I have yet to try delivery with any other local pizza shop just because it is so easy to order online versus trying to call in.. someone mis-interpretting your call or whatnot and pizza distasters ensue.\\nAfter attending one of Yelp Charlotte\\'s \"Made\" series, I went back to the market and had a new appreciation for Pure Pizza.  I have had many instances of eating here and all have been very good.  They range from sharing an afternoon snack with friends, to dining solo during the weekday, or fighting the weekend crowds to hang out at the market.\\n\\nIt\\'s almost as if the 7th Street Public Market is the perfect venue for Pure Pizza.  The casual environment, plus locally sourced ingredients, and the health conscious approach all makes for a delicious and un\\ncompromising local business that I would recommend to anyone visiting or living in Charlotte.  \\n\\nIt\\'s amazing so much flavor comes out of that small space they operate out of.  I have been meaning to check out their newly opened 2nd location (stand-alone) on Central.  \\n\\nOrder at the counter and you will get a number so that the friendly staff can locate you in the market to deliver your freshly-made pies of amazing-ness.  Your choices range from:  10 inch pizza, 16 inch pizza, or a 9in gluten-free pizza.  Don\\'t forget to put your pan away in the designated spot/bin!\\nAH.. O\\'Charley\\'s.  Seeing how the one by my old house closed down after a year or so, I didn\\'t really have high expectations walking into this one for lunch during the work week (near my office).  When you walk in, it is eerily empty, but you get seated right away.  Mind you, this is on a Tuesday in the middle of the week, but I would think at 12:30, more business and diners would be coming through.\\n\\nI\\'m not sure how old th\\nis location is, but it does have a mural on the wall - it\\'s pretty impressive and it still has reference to the Charlotte Hornets Basketball team so... \"old\".\\n\\nThere are some lunch specials that involve some sort of 1/2 sandwich and soup... I went that route.  Food was good and the loaded potato soup was filling enough.  Our server was super nice, but it did take a while to settle the bill (which I found strange since the place was not busy at all).\\n\\nOverall a great location for UNCC students to bring their visiting parents - I dunno if it will be anything more than that.  It will be on my lunch radar, but not too high on the list for the University Area.\\nI\\'m not a picky coffee drinker, but man... this place makes me want to know more about the craft that is coffee making/brewing.  Still fairly a newb to all the Chemex filters and drip coffee craze, but I totally get it.  My coffee making process is probably still on caveman level, but I can appreciate good coffee when I get it.  Not J\\nust Coffee really lives up to their name in providing a great product - and the line pretty much out the door when I was leaving today proves that if you make something good, people will wait for it.\\n\\nReally lucked out today and got the very last pop tart pastry... They warmed it up for me and it was pretty much gone in less than 60 seconds.  There goes my workout this morning, but man it was so worth it.  No wonder these don\\'t stick around the display case for too long.  I also saw some folks munching on quiches....  I\\'m going to put my name on one of those quiches/savory treats my next visit.\\n\\nThe devil is in the details... and for NJC... they have left no details to chance.  The space is beautiful at Packard Place.  I love the entrance with the old school white hex tiles and the ability to sit and watch people commute into Uptown on Church is a great way to start the day.  I\\'m a big fan of all the wood edged with metal... the large communal table in the center is broken up with some\\n clean angles... great for laying out drawings and materials to collaborate on.  \\n\\nStaff were diligently working behind the counter which contained all their coffee making magic.  Everyone was super nice and looked like they were working their butts off.  \\n\\nIt will be nice once the Ink & Ivy opens up and there\\'s no longer construction next door.  Definitely found a great spot to start the workday or even break it up during the day.\\nReally want to give this place a better rating, but did not have the best experience here.  I knew it wasn\\'t going to be a good experience when I had to quickly swerve into the parking lot realizing that the place name had changed - or was no longer \"Trailsend\" and a large red, white, and black lettered sign proclaiming \"Omega Coney Island Family Restaurant\" outside.\\n\\nOf course it was Father\\'s Day and it was packed.... and it was Sunday on top of that.  The hostess was really friendly - this is a type of place where you can walk in and they call you by your ', 'actual_label': 44, 'predicted_label': 44}, {'text': 'first name if you come here that often.  We waited about 5-10 minutes and were seated.\\n\\nOur waitress was nice and took our order - then it took about 30-40 min for the food to come out.  Granted the place was slammed, but I was noticing that the larger family groups were getting served before us - and were sat down after us.  It was just me and my mom so I don\\'t know if it was a father\\'s day thing or not, but man I was starving when the food finally came out.  I had the corned beef hash with 2 eggs... great flavor and eggs were cooked well.  It\\'s a home-style corned beef hash that I wasn\\'t used to and it was mixed in with hash browns which was a nice surprise.  \\n\\nHalfway into me digging into this large portion dish, the waitress came by and apologized that she gave me the wrong order.  I told her no problem and whatever I got was good anyway but she apologized profusely.  Later she came back and told me I did get the right thing and that she had just switched tickets with another table\\n by accident.  Weird enough to think that you are eating someone else\\'s food..... even weirder to not know what you are eating.  Oh well...\\n\\nPart of my mom\\'s order was wrong, but at this point we were so hungry it didn\\'t really matter.\\n\\nI will give this place another try since I am a breakfast fanatic.  But for now it\\'ll get a 3 star from me.\\n\\nI did want to say that the food is the main attraction at this place... the actual building itself looks to be a bit dated and the inside is nothing to write home about.\\nCame in here last night for something sweet after a good meal.  Got a small ice cream in a waffle cone and it included one free mix in.  I ended up choosing tiramisu with Oreo cookies mixed.... of course it was awesome.  Their ice cream was very creamy and the service was fast (considering it was 40 degrees outside... no one else was getting ice cream but us crazies).\\n\\nIt will be interesting, I bet this place gets crazy during the summer since it\\'s right in Stonecrest and near th\\ne nice water fountain feature.\\nI was sad to see that the Good Ol\\' Days Cafe/Diner had closed... Not that I went there daily, but it had been an Arboretum staple for me ever since I moved to Charlotte way back in the day. \\n\\nPleasantly surprised that in its place was a Sonny\\'s.  Yes, it\\'s a chain that spans over a couple states, but I\\'ve never really had any issue with the fact - I know some BBQ purists are rolling over in their graves as I type this review, but there is a reason why there are so many Sonny\\'s locations.\\n\\nDon\\'t come here semi-hungry!  There is a lot of food to be eaten at this place.  I opted for the special (on a Tuesday night) for the all you can eat ribs.  The first batch were a little tough, but the 2nd batch fell right off the bone.  There are a plethora of sides (or on the menu:  \"Side-kicks\") to choose from, I went with the corn on the cob and the mac and cheese.  Needless-to-say... my fingers and mouth area were totally covered in sauces by the time I was done.\\n\\nS\\nince this location is brand-spanking new, the dining area is super clean and the tables are very shiny.  It was like a high end country saloon with a nice bar in the middle of it.  Because of the shape of the space, there are other little dining room nooks where tables were, but we opted for the high top near the bar.\\n\\nWould I go out of my way to go to this restaurant?  Maybe not, but it\\'s a good option whenever I am in the area.\\nCame in here the other day to grab a 704 shirt since they have a partnership to sell and 704 doesn\\'t exactly have a brick and mortar shop.  Vanessa was super helpful, and apparently I was very lucky since the 704 shirts (particularly Hornets shirts) fly off the shelves.\\n\\nThe shop itself is pretty cool.  I am probably the least likely person to ask about jeans - to be completely honest, I am probably wearing the same jeans I\\'ve worn for 10 years that I purchased from a big box store.... so I\\'m not very fashion \"forward.\"  \\n\\nI like the idea of a \"perfect fit\" si\\nnce everyone comes in different shapes and sizes, but Vanessa definitely promised to help me out when I come in again.  I really love when places specialize and focus on one main product.  Here, it is jeans and you won\\'t be disappointed.\\n\\nSouthend is very lucky to have a unique clothing shop like Blue Hem to be part of the community... though with all the nearby restaurants opening up soon, this place will be my go-to since my expanding waistline will definitely need some new jeans to accommodate. :)\\nI\\'m so jazzed this place is finally open.  It is offering a limited menu until its Grand Opening, but I could not contain myself any longer and went to check it out last night.\\n\\nWorth the wait.  All spring I had been staring at the \"Ramen is coming May 2015\" sign on the door since I take the Lynx to work every morning.  Most of my instagram friends witnessed me taking photos of the progress of the patio outside... table and chairs being set out... the sign being placed atop the entrance.\\n\\n', 'actual_label': 44, 'predicted_label': 44}, {'text': 'Glad I went last night when things were not as crazy, but I\\'m sure they are going to get slammed this weekend.  Sat at the bar and took in the space.  The dining room has a modern feel - metal bar stools, but warm wood surfaces to balance everything.  The patio outside has some nice lighting and three big umbrellas to provide some shade.  Probably the best part about sitting at the bar is that you have a front row of all the action in the kitchen since there is a large hole in the wall where the orders are placed on the window and allows you to see just how hard the chefs and sous chefs are busting their butts to give you some tasty food.\\n\\nI had the Miso (Hungry):  Sweet white corn, pecan smoked pork belly, scallion, bean sprout, cabbage, onsen egg, sesame with house made chili sauce (a must).  So delicious.  the pork belly was super good, and I had a fun time fishing out the corn (which you could tell were fresh from the cob by the way the rows stuck together).  The chili sauce takes \\nit up a notch if you like spicy.  Will be interesting to see their full array of ramen and rolls once they \"fully\" open but judging by their limited menu now, I will probably be in here a lot.\\n\\nSitting at the bar, it was cool to talk to Adam and finding out more about how they got this place together.  It really has a nice neighborhood feel to it.  Nothing stuffy or pretentious... just casual... darn good ramen.  I loved how people would walk in from the South End neighborhood and see each other at the bar... great atmosphere.\\nAnother great local store that promotes an active lifestyle.  Pretty typical store with friendly faces.  They put you up on the treadmill and measure/analyze your gate and stride to put you in the best possible shoes.  Took a friend here to get fitted once and he walked away with a good pair of shoes.  This store is rarely busy and a good source for running tips, local races, and also some running gear!\\nNormally you say movie theater and I automatically give 5 st\\nars, but this one is hit or miss with me.  Sure the location is really convenient to Southpark and is mostly clean, but when this theater gets busy, its not a pretty site.\\n\\nFirst of all the \\'old-skool\\' ticket office at the front is really great, but when a line starts forming and reaches the parking deck, there is a problem.  Usually it\\'s because they only have one person manning the booth, but I would hope they run into this problem enough times to figure out they need to open more lines and get the line moving.  If you haven\\'t figure it out already, I am pretty punctual and like to attend my movies with a nice cushion to get all the previews in and also get a decent seat.  Seeing a line out in front is never a good sign.\\n\\nSecondly it seems like the past couple of times I\\'ve been here the movie I was attempting to see was sold out... usually right when I got to the box office window.  Even with time cushion!  I know it happens, but it is very disconcerting considering the lack of thea\\nters or alternatives around the area.\\n\\nLastly, the parking deck is convenient, but when you are standing outside of your car talking to friends and someone drives by and the platform vibrates up and down... I\\'m not a big fan.  More-often-than-not, it is designed to be like that, but I like my structures to be more static than dynamic.\\nCantina ranks up there in the places I like to visit along East Blvd.  While the businesses across the street tend to change out time and time again, Cantina seems to have weathered pretty well and has become a \"go-to\" staple for me whenever I am craving some good eats.\\n\\nRecently visited on a Saturday for lunch and the crowd wasn\\'t too bad.  They had streamlined there menu some and had a nice lunch menu to choose from.  I ended up having the Ancho Chicken Scaloppini & Cheese (Ancho chicken, caramelized poblano peppers and onions, melted Mexican cheeses) with a side chopped salad.  Dressing on the side, I only used about half of what they gave me but the s\\nalad was like crack and I could not get enough.  There were fresh avacados, chickpeas, jicama, greens, corn, black beans, and a whole lot of goodness packed into a small plate of salad.  The chicken on the sandwich was packed full of flavor.  My one comment was that some of the liquid from the chicken made the bread a bit soggy, but I powered through anyway.  The cheeses all melted in your mouth and I was stuffed in a good way for lunch that day.\\n\\nI know this place is pretty popular in the evenings, but the one thing that I do get annoyed with is the parking situation.  It\\'s great if you live down the street and can walk, but unfortunately the parking lot - they have done the best with what they have, but I do feel awkward parking in front of employees cars (double parking) but I think they do valet too so they can put your car wherever.\\n\\nThe patio is pretty amazing when the weather is cooperating.  And no visit to Cantina 1511 is complete without some tableside guacamole.\\nI live a lot', 'actual_label': 44, 'predicted_label': 44}, {'text': ' closer to the Costco in Matthews, but been here a couple times (either for gas) or picking things up after an airport run.  Great place to shop (be mindful of the bulk though) and the monthly coupon specials are nice as well.\\n\\nMy one gripe with this location is the setup they have at their gas pumps.  Maybe this location was put in as an after-thought, but it\\'s hard to navigate and make sure you are going the right way if you are looking for a pump lane.  Luckily it hasn\\'t been too crowded when I\\'ve gone for gas.... but the Matthews location has a nice queue area where the cars are out of the way of the main incoming traffic to the stores.\\nBeen a member of the Y for a couple years now. The Dowd is the location I probably frequent the most since its convenient to downtown and I can stop in and get my workout in before work or while I\\'m out running errands.\\n\\nThere are a lot of amenities that the Dowd has.... indoor pool, racketball courts, bball courts, cardiovascular machines, good siz\\ne locker room facilities and towel service.\\n\\nI\\'ve attended a bunch of spin classes here which are great. Do need to go back at some point... I don\\'t miss the terrifying walk down the stairs after the class since your legs are like jelly.... but that\\'s what you do the class for.\\n\\nThe Dowd also has a lot of running groups that meet in front and then take off running around the Dilworth area.    I think I even saw where they sponsored their own half marathon event a couple months ago.\\n\\n1 less star due to the gyms popularity.  Sometimes looking for a parking space can be a workout in itself.  Lately I\\'ve just been parking really far away and just jogging in with bag in tow... great warm up.\\nI\\'m not really sure how long this Pinkberry location has been open... it is conveniently located next to the Phillips Place movie theater so definitely a great location for it, but the downside is movie theater traffic...   as well as the soccer mom/dads picking up their kids from the movies.  There is \\na fountain with a round-about, but when I visited this time around there was a big mini van just idling in the middle of the roundabout.  I gave her a min to figure out what she was doing, but apparently she had created her own pick-up late/space right outside of the Pinkberry!  Very annoying and a clear hazard should any emergency vehicles need to pass through.\\n\\nRant aside, finally parked in the parking deck behind the Pinkberry.  There are 4-5 dedicated Pinkberry spots that have a 30min limit on them located directly behind the store.\\n\\nThere is a door from the back so you don\\'t have to walk around the building.\\n\\nWhat I noticed immediately was that it was warmer inside the store than outside!

I think the design of the building is more conducive to the drive thru especially since the parking feels like a death trap.\\n\\nThe inside is kept clean, sometimes the line on the inside is just as long as the drive through line wrapping around the building.\\nSuper torn... I want to give this place more stars since I have been to this location numerous nights out and this place has stood the test of time with all the BAR Charlottes, clubs, etc just catty-corner from here.\\n\\nIt makes me sad people write that this place is \"dirty\" but I think that all falls within the Fuel decor theme.... usually when I go the tables are tidy and everything else is in order.  It could be the concrete floor and the overall look with the vintage signs and machinery sprinkled about the dining area.\\n\\nDining format... just like any other Fue\\nl location, you approach the counter order your food and get a number.  Once the slices have been re-heated through the oven a server will bring it to you at your table.  Drinks are self serve... staff are friendly enough.  Maybe because this location has been here for a while, the staff take their customers for granted and the service may not be as sharp as it may have once been.\\n\\nThis location does have a tiny patio and their front windows open up when the weather is nice.... it\\'s a good option if you find yourself uptown, but I think the other location on the Green  is literally just 4 blocks away.  With the 7th Street Market and Pure Pizza doing their thing in the market, I guess it\\'s a hard sell for me to walk another block for pizza that\\'s okay.  Oh, I forgot, Brixx is nearby too... Maybe they should change the name of 1st ward to \"pizza ward.\"\\nBrewery in SouthPark!?!  If anyone could do it, it would be Legion.

This area was once Cleveland's Gaytown. It was anchored by Bounce. Other notable establishments were the Tool Shed and Man's World.\\nMy friend's girlfriend told me to check out this place for some pottery and plates. It is a nice store to stroll around in and look at stuff. They have decent rugs at good prices. The furniture section didn't offer great deals. There were some nice accent pillows for around $8. There is such a wide variety of styles and colors, it is easy to find things that will fit your particular theme. The quality is not the highest and that is exactly what I am looking for at this juncture in life.\\nI watched some football games here with my friends yesterday. They had the NFL ticket. I asked the old guy who works there what games will be on. He sounded like Steve-O from Jackass but with throat cancer. He said he didn't know and acted really cocky when my friend asked if \\nthey will have the Bengals game on. A lot of screens to watch the game. I am out here on vacation. I realized that Cleveland, OH is not that bad. I rather not deal with these people out here. The bartenders were mean as rattlesnakes. I want a bar maid who makes me feel wanted, talks to me, sympathizes with my situation and makes me feel good about getting drunk. Give me a regular hole in the wall bar. This place lacked authenticity. One of the servers almost made up for the place sucking so bad. She was a real pleasure to deal with. She was a kind person who realized that if you are nice to the customers, you will usually get tipped accordingly.\\nI buried my hatchets, made my amends and moved back down to Tremont. Hotz's is a great place to relax and have some cheap drinks while staying away from the crowds.\\nA great car wash. I'll slide through here while people wait in line for 30 minutes at Giant Eagle or the other place on W 117th. The place around the corner on 117 is called Laser W\\nash. I don't want any damned lasers blasting my car. Last time I checked lasers are hot things that melt and burn. I rather have a traditional car wash that uses water. Consumers are fascinated by technology however and if there is the mention of a laser people believe it is a superior product.\\nI came here with some coworkers. They put it on the soul sucking corporate card. A few of the rolls seemed small and did not hold together very well. The older lady server in there was a real treat to speak with. She had a very positive aura and vibe. Giving a place 3 stars makes me feel like I am a sourpuss. I would like to encourage all you people reading this to go here. In my heart it is more than 3 stars.\\nI am moving back closer to Lakewood and I will be a few blocks from Papa Nick's. I had a few friends that worked here growing up and always enjoyed the pizza. It is nothing spectacular and definitely not as bad as the reviewers on here make it out to be. My family would come here occassion\\nally and nobody really complained. It is a great option for a little neighborhood place to eat.\\nA recent date had me driving to Strongsville and using my GPS to find the way. I should have got off on the Royalton Rd exit instead of Pearl, that is beside the point. We came on a Tuesday, purely by coincidence and it was the half off day. All of the rolls were good. The service was alright. They definitely were slammed and it took about 20 minutes to get my beer. The little salads with ginger dressing were refreshing and light. I normally don't venture out to Strongsville but was glad that I did. It seems like everything that you need is within spitting distance of each other. The bill came out to around $50 and we left stuffed to the gills. If I lived a little bit closer, I would frequent Shinto for the many different specials they have throughout the week.\\nThey make great beer. I had the pulled pork and my friend had the steak and sausage. He said it was good, mine was alright. The wait\\nress was not good but oh well, it is not like I was in a rush anyway or ever have anything or place to go in a hurry. I don't see why people are always in such a rush. Such as rush hour. You are going to just end up at home 9 times out of 10 and be mad regardless. End up yelling at the wife and hanging out in the garage or whatever married people do.\\nThe east and west dichotomy is real. East side has a few Jewish delis. The west side has a few Arab delis. I am not too familiar with Jewish delis. I wish there were some on the west side. I thought Jack's was great and definitely worth the long drive down Cedar. The corned beef was excellent. The breakfast food is also fantastic. You can make your own omelet and add whatever you like. Meat is a dollar to add and veggies are fifty cents. I added avocado and it made a good omelet filling. The lox were also good. I ended up meeting up with my friend at Edgewater Park and went into food paralysis for a couple hours.\\nMy friend wanted to check \", 'actual_label': 45, 'predicted_label': 45}, {'text': 'out Coventry last weekend. So we did. We ended up going in this place. Does everyone on the eastside wear those nerd frame glasses like Paul Pfeifer from the Wonder Years? Even the chicks did. Either way, I started talking to a really sweet girl from West Virginia. I asked her if she knew who The Dancing Outlaw Jesco White is, she said \"Yeah, he is a friend of the family. He is from Boone County though. I think he gives West Virginians a bad name.\" I couldn\\'t have disagreed with her anymore. That really made my night and probably changed my opinion on the place. In all reality, it is probably a two star bar.\\nI don\\'t see what the big deal is. Kind of expensive. I had both the Cracker Park and the one in Weaks-ville. I prefer the Annex Burger in Solon. I like dumpy places where hillbillys gather. The Annex Bar in Solon is such a place. Buckeye Beer Engine in Lakewood makes good burgers. I try to stay away from red meat though. Is the B Spot a play on the G Spot? Does the G Spot exist? Is\\n this a place where gangsters gather? I think that South Central is the best gangster/hood movie ever. Menace II Society had terrible characters and I could care less if any of them died. If I do ever come out with a burger place called G Spot, I will call the best burger the \"OG Bobby Johnson\" in tribute to the lead character in South Central.\\nThe hash browns were like cubed french fries. I liked them. The food was good. There was a slice of an orange on my plate. I thought it was a garnish of some sort or was to be used to squirt the juice on the food but she told me to eat it. I thought it was weird to have just one slice of orange and grapefruit on a plate. They give patrons a pitcher of coffee to drink even if you order only one cup. I gave myself 3 refills. There was a little tray of cream to get the coffee on track. The breakfast sandwich was about the same as it would anywhere else. Breakfast food is hard to mess up. The waitress was solid and I thought this place was pretty co\\nol.\\nLas Vegas is like spring break. Except all of the people are adults and more pathetic. I was hungover, walking on the strip in 2005 when a hooker asked what I was getting into. I told her I was feeling sick and stay away. She didn\\'t listen. I puked and it almost landed on her shoes. That is the perfect metaphor for Las Vegas. A prostitute ducking vomit.\\nI was here with my family years ago. We didn\\'t think much of it. I met up with a friend here today and was blown away by the corned beef. Great sandwich although it was expensive. My friend had the pastrami and it was great. I would stick to the deli sandwiches here, it sounds like some of the other menu items made people mad.\\nAdega is the classy new Mediterranean restaurant at the 9. I am not going to check it out. I prefer to support family businesses like Oasis Bakery in the heart of Lakewood. I also have less of a chance of running into Johnny Manziel at Oasis which is a blessing. I was disappointed when La Pita Express closed d\\nown a few years ago. Oasis took over the location and is doing a great job at providing excellent Lebanese food to the community. The meat is delicious and halal. The falafel and tabouli are great vegetarian options. Oasis is slightly closer than the many great Middle Eastern places on Lorain Ave so I will dine here a lot. I have not had a bad meal. If somebody suggests Aladdin\\'s or Taza, tell them no and go to Oasis.\\nI tried the Marley\\'s Mellow Mood Black Tea today. It has a bunch of ingredients that are supposed to put you at ease and relax you. With all of the energy drinks out there, I thought this was a good alternative to the jitters and being hyped up. The herbal blend has valerian root, lemon balm, chamomile, hops, passion flower and melatonin. The tea is decaf so it won\\'t get you wired. I didn\\'t get as relaxed as my friend did. He said he drank it at work and almost nodded off. I have just been floating around the house. Writing reviews, watching the Hooters girl contest and j\\nust other odd things. I guess I feel pretty mellow. Sometimes I think I could use this more than others.\\nI saw Paleface play here last night. The show was free (donations only) and he was pretty good. I never hear of shows that I would like to see coming through here. The place was alright, if they would book more shows that I would be into I would go there again. Very convenient location. The beer list was average, staff was friendly. I had a good time. I hope to see another show there soon.\\nThere are a few decent finds here. The price is right on a lot of things, although the quality is not always the best. The American Signature line of furniture is where you can find good quality at a good price. I agree with Cara as far as second hand shopping for tables, wood, metal things et cetera. I do not like buying second hand things that are porous. Too many weird things can happen on couches and then get stuck on them. I got a decent loveseat here for $500.00 because it was a closeout.

It brought much needed balance. I had some great conversations with Uncle Mark about Chicago in the 70\\'s and 80\\'s and his many fights against the street gang known as the Insane Unknowns. I come from a family of proud Polish people and after hanging out with the clan I was feeling a great connection with my brethren. I saw a sign that read \"Czehoski\" and knew I had to saunter in. This is exactly the opposite of the Polish bars I am used to. I am a member of Roosevelt Veterans Post #58 Polish Club in Cleveland, OH. \\n\\nhttp://plavpost58.blogspot.com/\\n\\nCzehoski was a culture shock. The bartender was beautiful though and enchanting. The bartender at Post 1 in Cleveland is an old Polish man with no legs so this little lady barmaid at Czehoski is a welcome change. A dude c\\name up to me and asked if I preferred Samsung or Apple phones. I told him Samsung and clearly that is the case because I had my phone sitting on the bar. He then asked \"So what is your angle? Are you trying to get picked up?\" to which I replied \"I just buried my Godmother and am wandering around\" which gave him the answer in a roundabout way.\\nMy mom beat cancer here. I grew up down the street from here and needed the ER a lot. I didn\\'t love coming here although they fixed the things that went wrong. \\n\\n\"I went to the doctor. I said I\\'m feeling kind of rough. Let me break it to you son, your sh**\\'s f***ed up. I said my sh**\\'s f***ed up? Well I don\\'t see how. He said the sh** that used to work, won\\'t work now.\" -Warren Zevon\\nThe food here is good. Three friends and I wanted some decent dinner last night. Yelp led us here as it was close in proximity to my friend\\'s apartment. We shared the fried zucchini appetizer, which was tasty. The bread was great also. The pasta entrees are all around\\n $10 or $11. The chicken parmesan was very filling and the portion was huge. Enough to get full and have leftovers. My friend ordered the lemon chicken pasta and loved it. Another friend got a shrimp pasta dish and said it was good. The service was excellent. This was a nice, cheap dinner.\\nI needed to burn some vacation time before the year ended and so I walked around Cleveland like a tourist and took a bunch of silly pictures with friends, went places I normally wouldn\\'t and acted a fool! We came to the Christmas Story House and Museum the Friday before Christmas and had a wonderful time. The entry fee of $10 was well worth it.\\nA great cafe and shelter from the storm of Yonge St. The girls working here were so sweet and advised me to visit the local market for a good Toronto experience. I kind of fell in love with the girl who works there. I guess it will never amount to anything though. We shared a beautiful moment in time and maybe when my earthly days are done, we will dance toget\\nher and relive the eternal moment. The Americano was excellent.\\nAn excellent place for Neapolitan style pizza. The pizza is simple and light. They use San Marzano tomatoes and the sauce is good. They charge $13 for a margherita which is about standard for the style. The service was excellent and the atmosphere was great. I enjoyed sitting at a table with the cool breeze blowing in while observing the Queen St nightlife. Lo Zingaro is definitely a better option than the many NY style places up and down the street.\\nThe reverse happy hour was cool. I ended up getting a little drunk here. The waitress was nice to deal with. The open faced filet sandwich was great. I can\\'t really remember much else about it. The beer selection was alright. If I lived around here I would be a creepy regular and hit on the attractive wait staff.\\nI got tired of buying new tires. Tired of being ripped off by places like Conrads. The commercials annoy me when the lady creepily whispers \"Conrads\" in a breathy and\\n disturbing voice. I needed two new front tires because my high performance, front wheel drive Yaris wheels spin so fast, they lose tread. Just because you need tread doesn\\'t mean you need to spend bread. I got two barely used tires installed for $70. And they unbent my rim that was abused from all of Frank Jackson\\'s strategically placed potholes. I will never go to a place like NTB or Firestone again.\\nI wish this was still Fazio\\'s, the old grocery store that once occupied this building. I was once an avid supporter of government organizations and unions. I have changed my tune after working for the government and a union. The people that work here have no respect for their customers. They act like Steven Seagal Above the Law or they just hopped up out of the trash can a la Oscar the Grouch. Don\\'t think you cannot be fired. It is no surprise that more people are using companies like FedEx to get the job done. The level of disrespect and incompetence is at level red, severe.\\nGreat meat.', 'actual_label': 45, 'predicted_label': 45}, {'text': ' A lady cuts a piece of meat off a sausage link as soon as you walk in and hands it to you. I wish this was the policy of every store. The sausage and the smokies are outstanding.\\nThe service has always been great at SOHO. The food has been good and prices definitely adjusted to the fancy car driving clientele of the neighborhood. It could end up being a pretty expensive dinner for food that is usually not marked up this high. Biscuits are brought out before the meal and they are delicious. Like Shock G said on The Humpty Dance \"Just grab \\'em in the biscuits.\" The chicken and waffles are good but could be had down the street at XYZ for $4 cheaper and taste just about the same. Anything with country ham on the menu is worth ordering. Most  items are calorie laden but if you want to try to eat something nutritionally decent, the harvest moon salad is a good lunch option. There are a couple of interesting parallels with that dish and Neil Young. Of course the song title and also his menti\\non of country ham in the song Albuquerque. I most enjoyed the chicken-fried pork salad at lunch that has deviled eggs, avocado, bacon, corn, tomato and Green Goddess dressing.  The hush puppies are a great appetizer to share. This is a good brunch option in Ohio City if you crave a hearty and filling meal.\\nAs other people have mentioned, the floor is cool. They do have a lot of records. And the vintage shop next door seemed cool. There were kitties walking around and I love cats so that appealed to me. I was there for my friend\\'s release party for his new comic book, The Lake Erie Monster. The comic is sweet and you should all support them! It is by John G and Jake Kelly. They are talented guys and the comic is sweet. I got a couple of posters and cannot wait to frame and hang them! Check out their site:\\nhttp://thelakeeriemonster.com/\\nI parked behind ABC Tavern. The sign clearly states to pay meter only during bank hours. I was there at 9 PM on a weeknight. I called to complain and sai\\nd it must be the most extensive banking hours in all of the universe. That was a joke because the bank was not really open when these jokers gave me a ticket. The ticket was for $50 yet offered a break if i paid in 14 days and said I only owed $25. I said they are wrong and sent in a picture of the sign. The dude said \"Send me a check for $3\" which i just reluctantly did.\\nMy friend and I were the only people at the bar on an off night. I cannot really blame anyone but myself if I had a bad time. It reminded me of my Grandma Marian\\'s sister Aunt Shirley\\'s basement bar. I don\\'t know what this place is like on the weekend, but I am guessing super lame because the people around Scottsdale aren\\'t that cool to me. But hey, I am from Cleveland and enjoy hanging out with low lifes and scumbags.\\nAny record store that has a large selection of Townes Van Zandt knows good music.\\nThe burrito was good. My friend ordered the shredded chicken, I had the pork. The guac is included in the $6.15 price wh\\nich is a good selling point. The grandma\\'s salsa style is sweet and slightly spicy. I live a couple of minutes away and will be coming here often. There was a hot sauce bottle there with a skeleton cartoon like the grim reaper on it called Ass Reaper!\\nEdgewater Park is great in the summer. Even when the creep in girl\\'s underpants trots around with his walking stick. I have recently followed in my father\\'s footsteps and adopted the practice of lakeside meditation. It is wonderful to sit upon the high bluff and view the waves rolling in succession and watching them break. Also, the avian activities are more visible from high atop the cliff. The seagulls are graceful to watch in flight. Annoying when on the beach. It is nice to walk down to the water\\'s edge on a cold and cloudy day and feel the energy and force. The sounds of wind and water are so soothing that it acts as noise cancelling element and drowns out all thought and reminders of daily living. This is where I come to be one with\\n nature. I moved very close in proximity because of this. When I drive towards downtown on Route 2 at night and look to the left, it seems like Lake Erie is the edge of the world. When one gazes into the water it is pure blackness. Edgewater Park is one of my favorite places in Cleveland.\\nThe Virgil E. Brown Building provides necessary services for the people of Cuyahoga County. It is the main building that houses human services for the community. It is a shame that there is not public parking. That would only make too much sense to provide free parking for people who are applying for public assistance I suppose.\\nPupusas here are awesome. When you step up to the counter to order, they give you a checklist of the menu, similar to that of Happy Dog, with more options than just tubes of meat and toppings. One list is in Spanish. If you cannot understand, ask for the English. The staff does not speak English. This makes the dining experience even better. The service is more like that of a ', 'actual_label': 45, 'predicted_label': 45}, {'text': 'fast food restaurant. After turning in the checklist, you sit and wait. It did take a while to get the food. El Salvadorian food is very good. Get some pupusa! This is a must visit restaurant to try out some authentic food from El Salvador!\\nI don\\'t see what the big deal is. The food is expensive. The hummus tasted store bought. The baba ganoush was not that great either. Falafal was decent. I could make a milk shake at home. The sandwiches are not that great. The french onion soup is something crazy like $6 a hit. This place is over hyped in my opinion. I think it is like Melt, people just convince themselves that it is really good when it in fact is average and just priced high. I would rather go to Grum\\'s down the street. I am beginning to think that is overrated too.\\nWhen I was young, my family would come to Pier W and Swingos for brunch when there were important goings on. I have not been to Pier W in quite some time. I usually go to Pier Z (Lake House Cafe) as it is more budget fr\\niendly with the same view. Pier W is definitely more of a special occasion type of place. I would not say a first date place because if you are honest with yourself, a first date is not worth spending a truck load of money on. At least in my world. Respect needs to be gained. You could be breaking bread one day and a stranger the next. There is an extremely fickle populous on planet Earth. This is the Age of Aquarius and waterside dining does seem appropriate. First dates are best reserved for the Lido. Then you can gauge commitment and if they are truly down to ride or die. The happy hour is one of the best in the city. Seating can be tight so try to arrive early.\\nFlannery\\'s is a nice place to go for a couple of beers. The food is decent. I never suggest to friends that we go here. I am usually taken here by somebody. Nothing too cool has ever happened to me here. I am really drawing a blank on this one.\\nPeople are always writing \"I came here with my girlfriend/boyfriend\" etc and what\\nnot in their reviews on Yelp. I avoid using this distinction because that can change like the weather and then you have a slew of reviews you will have to correct to past tense. I will sometimes mention if I am with my Ace Boon Coon Steve L. because enshallah we will be breaking bread for years to come. I came here with Steve L. It was packed as warned by Yelp reviewers. The breakfast was excellent. The staff was wonderful. As I would like to sing the Golden Girls theme \"Thank you for being a friend\" to my homie, it reminded me that the staff here reminded me of the Golden Girls themselves. I say that with nothing but love. The option to add a side of avocado is something that all spots should do.\\nLife Goes On at Corky\\'s. I think a lot of people go here for the sing along music. I think a lot of energy has been transferred to that activity. It is sad because that takes away from the drinking aspect. This was a good bar to be down and out at. I still have had excellent times at Corky\\'s \\nand it is one of the best bars in the Cleveland area.\\nI am deeply saddened to learn that Sakura is closed. I had a few good memories here. It was a lot better than Bob\\'s Big Boy or whatever the hell. I would much prefer the cute little waving cat statues out front as opposed to the stupid fat boy holding a tray or whatever with his greased back hair. Unfortunately, some people do not share these same feelings. I remember walking past Sakura, drunk, late at night a few times and noticing that some asshole spray painted a red stripe on the cat. These feelings of mine have been hurt by this. It was so sad to see that a peaceful, cute and friendly cat statue would provoke someone to think \"Hey, there goes a super cute and inviting statue, I am going to ruin it!\". This just speaks volumes of our society and the pieces of shit that exist who shouldn\\'t. The government gives us too much freedom. They should mandate vasectomy or at least offer money to do it. There are too many dumb people on t\\nhe planet having kids, and those kids are growing up savage and spray painting cute things that represent the little bit of good that is left in the world. I relate to Travis Bickle in Taxi Driver when he said \"Some day a real rain will come and wash all the scum off the streets\". I guess that is what brought me to buying rounds of ammo on this hot and balmy Saturday morning.\\nSome coworkers asked if I wanted to go out for lunch today for a business meeting. I can never turn down a free meal. They love the China King. I thought it was good enough. It is what I would expect out of a small Chinese food place in Independence, OH. A lot of the normal offerings with some other cuisines thrown in the mix. I opted for the Spicy Basil Chicken and it was not too bad. I am back in the cubicle sipping on some water because I could feel my body going into salt shock a little bit. I need to balance that out. I loved the lady that worked here and she was a pleasure to deal with. The prices are fair a', 'actual_label': 45, 'predicted_label': 45}, {'text': 'nd the portions large.

It is better than Bonchon Korean fried chicken. The meat falls off the bone, is tender with a perfectly crispy outside. The big breast piece is also great. Mac and cheese and asparagus round off the list of sides for a great meal. The happy hour is pretty good too. I will be eating here a lot more.\\nI have been to Lucky\\'s a couple of times. It is always a ruckus when you walk in. Very close quarters with people paying at the counter and people entering. I think the place is alright. The food is good here. Not good enough to be spending dinner entree prices for a breakfast though. I would rather just grab a piece of bread, spread peanut butter on it \\nand be full for a few hours for the price of 50 cents, but some people like making a big production out of breakfast on the weekends so I go here with them. This is a nice place to eat, the service is ok, somewhat elitist with high prices. I would rather pay $5 for a cheap breakfast with crazy eggs that came out of a crazy mutant chicken and have the extra money to spend on other things.\\nThis is quickly becoming one of my favorite places to go since I have moved a lot closer. The staff is always great. I had two Hop Slams last night. $7.50 a bottle kind of hurts. Luckily they are limited release. The chicken and waffles are good. I would advise customers to steer clear of the pizza. It is alright pizza, just not worth the money. It is good to get away from the crowded bars of Tremont/Ohio City that I used to frequent. I am wondering if in 10-15 years when those places get played out, will the Gordon Square/Shoreway area will be the next big thing. I don\\'t think that will happen. Strang\\ner things have occurred.\\nOne of my favorite places to go in the summer. The old guy who wears girls bikini bottoms has been there every time I have been there this summer. He is truly a sight to behold. You can find him behind the guard stand usually, standing with a walking stick. If you are a cute, younger girl, he may even offer you a strawberry. That is one of his moves. Edgewater is such a nice place to go in the summer. I will try to make it out there as much as possible. There has been a lot more women showing up as of late also. I think the guy with the bikini bottom has a knack for bringing them to the beach. Or his walking stick is a magnet for girls. Check out the picture of the guy!\\nA girl at work was saying that we should try out this new place in Lakewood. I couldn\\'t wait to line up some dinner plans so I decided to check it out on my own. Barroco took over the former Kraus\\' Pizza building. They knocked down a wall and it is a way better use of space. There is artwork han\\nging on the walls available for purchase and good music playing in the background. They had on an all reggae playlist while I ate. You place your order at the counter and they bring it out to your table once complete. I had the arepa and cuban sandwich. I ran into some old classmates from high school who are regulars. They said they have been there 4 times already and I think it just opened. The girls were eating the cheese and corn dip and offered up some for me to try. I was being extremely bashful, as usual, and declined. The arepa was delicious. All of the sauces were good but the standouts were the spicy and pineapple. The service was outstanding. Really nice guys. I am glad they chose to open this business in Lakewood. Birdtown too, a neighborhood that could use place like this. I just wish it was closer to Tremont so I could eat there more often. It is an excellent option if you want to eat something that tastes really good and affordable.\\nMy employer had our holiday party here \\nlast night. I heard we were going to WhirlyBall. I told my boss that this was my childhood nickname. A co-worker heard this and remarked \"Whirly Ball?\" WhirlyBall is awesome. I had no idea what to expect. It is bizarre. You ride around in bumper cars holding lacrosse type baskets and attempt to pick up a wiffle ball with them. Then you try to throw the ball at a backboard using the scooper. There are 5 cars on each team, and the cars kind of block and bump into you while you attempt to score. It is like basketball, Ullamaliztli (that Aztec ball game to the death), lacrosse, bumper cars rolled into one weird indoor game. The room that holds the cars smells of electric weirdness. It definitely brings out the inner child in you. I highly recommend checking out WhirleyBall. If you are ever sitting around wondering what to do with 9 of your friends, WhirlyBall should come to mind. Instead of throwing money away on a Friday or Saturday at a W 25th bar, go to play WhirlyBall. It is one of the', 'actual_label': 45, 'predicted_label': 45}, {'text': ' most fun activities that I have done in a long time.

I have been there twice now and had a variety of options. I have almost stopped eating meat entirely so this time around I tried the fish and tofu. On my prior visit, I had beef, chicken and pork. I thought the beef was the best option. The spice is not too overwhelming. I enjoy my food very spicy and the ghost pepper sauce was not too crazy. The atmosphere is nice. I enjoy coming to places where I feel comfortable and in my \"element\". Usually this is a bar type setting. I appreciate that this is a bar that serves semi-healthy and fresh tasting food. My friend and I were driving around aimlessly yesterday and after about 20 miles of cruising we ended up here. The beer selection is pretty good. And now that I come to t\\nhink of it, 806 was a terrible place. I think I only liked it because good things happened a couple times after going there. Barrio is a good addition to Tremont.\\nDuring the week I like to go here and order up some Buffalo wings or mini burgers. They have decent bar food. The wings are my default choice. They are cooked well done and are never mushy, rubbery and weird. My favorite hot wings in Cleveland. The music is hit or miss but mostly miss. The patio is a great oasis during a summer day or night, as long as it isn\\'t busy. They charge  too much for domestic draft beer.\\nWhat an awesome store! The staff is always awesome and helpful. They have a lot of nice hand blown glass tobacco pipes. I saw a Sponge Bob one last time I was down there. They also have the hookah tobacco that tastes like candy. A large t-shirt selection with musicians and other funny shirts about weird stuff that may make people laugh when they see your shirt. Or they might just think that you are a weird dude for w\\nearing it.\\nI love the interior of the restaurant. It is such a nice welcoming scene. I love the wood walls and the fish tanks right in the doorway. Minh-Anh is also my favorite place to go for pho. It is a little bit on the salty side but the flavors are much more intense than any other place around. I try to order something different on the menu each time I go. Some of my new favorites are the grilled pork with rice and beef vermicelli. I believe the prices have went up a dollar or so in the last year and I am happy to pay that extra charge for great food. And don\\'t let the white servers throw you off like they did old Steve L. Minh-Anh is not just my favorite Vietnamese place in Cleveland, it is one of my favorite restaurants all around.\\nIt is called House of Blues because you get the blues after spending so much God damned money at this pit. The staff is grumpy too.\\nLast night we were in Lakewood and my friends requested that we come here. Although, they call the Sloane Pub \"The Hai\\nrless Hamster\". I don\\'t know why they call it that, but they do. When a night starts going south, the idea to salvage the night together is either \"The Hamster\" or The Lido.\\nI was in a really bad mood a couple weeks ago. I didn\\'t really want to be around anybody or do much of anything. One of my closest friends called me up and said that he and his wife were heading to Sullivan\\'s. My old man\\'s retirement/going away party was here. Bitter sweet memory. I sampled a lot of appetizers on that occasion without eating an entrée. When I returned with my friend, I decided on eating some big food to ease the pain. A little conversation, jokes, laughter, IPA buzz and I felt recharged and ready for the world! This was a very family friendly business. There was some crazy kid in a Raiders shirt scampering around being wild. His parents could not control him too well. An older guy who was a regular almost knocked into some cute girl who was out on a date. The bartender told him it was time to go. T\\nhere was a nice fire burning inside. Overall, the atmosphere was great along with the service and food. As much as I like going to the Harp, I may prefer Sullivan\\'s.\\nYellow Cab is usually a last resort. The dispatcher is sometimes fun to deal with. I think her name was Pinky. She was cool as hell. The fares just seem kind of expensive, the drivers seem to always take the scenic route. It is never too scenic, just out of the way and creepy. I have opted to walk home to Tremont from Downtown on numerous occasions instead of calling them up. This is partly due to me enjoying going for long walks after drinking. The Carnegie bridge is beautiful to walk over at night.\\nThe play on words is great and true. My wheels came out looking really clean. This is a decent car wash. They have a special for a month of car washes for $40. You can use the card for multiple vehicles and even let your friend take a spin through the drive thru. I love letting my car get slapped by the giant pieces of fabric.', 'actual_label': 45, 'predicted_label': 45}, {'text': \"\\n15 cent wings on Tuesdays.\\nCleveland Flea is a fun place to shop. It reminds me of the Bazaar Bizarre. There are a lot of local vendors selling their goods. My brother sells at real flea markets. The Cleveland Flea has a very different vibe from these traditional flea markets. I don't think the vendors here bargain or negotiate pricing. Cleveland Flea is a fun place to come and walk around even if you do not want to buy anything. The food court in the basement is worth the trip alone. The gingerbread ice cream from Mason's Creamery and Chillax tea from T by Sarah have made my week. I believe it is on the second Saturday of every month.\\nThe beer selection is good. I met some interesting people from around the globe while sipping brews. One gentleman told me this was one of the highest rated breweries in the world. I disagree. The coffee stout was my favorite. Almost as good as Founders Breakfast Stout.\\nMy friend called me last Saturday asking if I wanted to get some brunch at Le Petite\\n Triangle. We went and there was a wait as usual. I flipped through some bookmarks on Yelp and we decided on Miega. There is a weird false door with a crazy face on it. Don't try to go through that one or else you will look dumb as we did. There was a martial arts class going on across from the restaurant which was cool to walk past and see. The interior of the restaurant is contemporary and very clean. The music that was playing was awesome. They had some Korean sounding hip-hop which reminded me of an album my brother gave to me for Christmas in '97 or '98 called Bomb Worldwide: International Rap Compilation. I love to hear rap music from other countries. The service bell on the table was very cool. I am definitely not the prude I once was and now really enjoy Korean food. My favorite dish was S15 Gal Bi Dol Sot Bi Bim Bob. My friend and I both agreed that this was one of the best brunches ever. My little hangover was gone immediately.\\nI like the fact that it is downtown and easy to \\nget to. The sound is usually good and shows start at the right time. I just saw Mobb Deep, Raekwon and Cappadonna the other night at House of Blues and had a great time. Prodigy was a skinny guy in the past. He came out of prison pretty jacked up. It was awesome to see these guys doing classics from the 90's. The staff is usually flustered and pissed off. The only genuinely nice person was the dude in the bathroom who hands you towels and offers knickknacks and conversation. I don't like tipping them most of the time because it is kind of weird. I feel like I can usually handle going to the bathroom by myself. I don't need to feel like I am seeing my PO with him standing over my shoulder while I piss. Then, on top of all of that, I have to give him money? Either way, I usually comply. Since this is a corporate joint, there should be some kind of customer service training for the staff. I much rather go see a show at a smaller venue.\\nI am just happy there is something else to eat for lu\\nnch. It is a lot better than Subway. It is a chain, and that always bothers me. Doesn't bother me enough not to eat their food though. The process of ordering is cool, but weird. You can pick any combination of toppings to your sub that you wish at Which Wich. I ended up having a turkey on wheat, toasted with tomato, onion, hummus, avocado ($1 extra), oil & vinegar, oregano, salt & pepper and lettuce. It was very good. It came to around $6 for a 7 inch sub. I will come back and try more. My friend ordered the Italian two days in a row and enjoyed it both times.\\nThe taco options are carnitas, steak, chorizo and something else. They have grilled peppers for an additional charge. The tacos are authentic and simple. They have side dishes of fresh cilantro, limes and onion to garnish your tacos when they come off the grill. They are only $2 per taco. They are only available on the weekend. I encourage taco lovers to come here! You won't have the hipster vibe of Barrio which is a plus!\\n\\nThe \\ngrocery store is pretty nice as well. They cater to Mexican cuisine and have things you will not find at a normal store (cactus and odd beef cuts). They have fresh made salsa and guacamole in the $2-$6 price range. They have the standard mild along with salsa verde. They have one of my favorite hot sauces as well for $2 and some change: El Yucateco Mayan XXXtra Hot.\\nThis is not a normal Marc's. Items are on shelves instead of the floor. People are not freaking out in the aisles. It does not have the aesthetics of a crack house. There are no parrots or weird animals on display. The 1% win again.\\nI am house sitting for one of my best friends. He and his wife went to California for a week, so I am in Berea looking for places to explore. A couple people recommended this place. I am half Polish. I appreciate Polish culture. This bar lacked any Polish decor and vibe. The Berea locals advised me of this before I went in. They told me at one point in time, it was more Pole-centric. Not anymore\", 'actual_label': 45, 'predicted_label': 45}, {'text': '. It was full of college kids partying, I was drinking alone. I felt really out of place. I guess the youngsters don\\'t understand drinking alone yet. It is still a nice bar that I would appreciate more if it was less occupied.\\n10 cent tacos on Thursdays. These prices seem fake. I didn\\'t believe it \\'til I went up there. Can\\'t vouch for the tacos as I have not yet tried them. The wings are good though. The hot is not a typical hot sauce, it has flakes of red pepper. The other flavors were also good.\\nIf you need a simple exhaust or muffler fix, they got it here for cheap. For the low so to speak. If you need a repair that requires extensive labor requiring the engine to be removed or if the exhaust leak is close to the manifold, they will not be able to do it. You cannot make an appointment and need to wait in the waiting room. It reminds me of The Walking Dead. Pretty weird but life is weird.\\nI won\\'t go to Simone\\'s Liquor store in Lakewood. I need to add that to my boycott list. Once upo\\nn a time, I was in my 20\\'s shopping at Simone\\'s and one of the clerks asked me for ID as I browsed the aisles. I was pissed and walked out; never to return. I live about 12 blocks from Sapell\\'s and here is where I go if I need some liquor to entertain guests. Like Pac said \"Pour out a little liquor\".\\nTarboosh is pretty good. I try to tell my coworkers to venture off the beaten path and forgo another visit to Aladdin\\'s and try something different and equally as good. I bought a variety of samplings from the menu and it all was good. The kibbeh was my favorite. Tarboosh will be one of my regular lunch stops now that I will be forced to remain indoors for the winter. I will miss taking my walks around Independence.\\nThe best bagel I have had outside of NYC. The chain bagel places cannot compare. I don\\'t even consider them to be bagels. The bagels here are produced the way they were intended to be, by boiling them. It is worth driving to Bialy\\'s for bagels. The great thing about them is, yo\\nu can buy a large amount of them and throw them in the freezer and eat them at will! You don\\'t need to drive 8 hours to get a good bagel, just go to Bialy\\'s.\\nI came here for a reading last month and left happy. I am glad that there is a store like this in town. Everybody seems to be buying from the internet and reading Nooks and stuff. I got the new issue of Found magazine and it was funny as usual. Keep hope alive.\\nI don\\'t like them anymore. There are better things to do on a Sunday afternoon than watch the clowns play.\\nI thought Arabs cooked the best kabobs until I tried some Chinese ones. The lamb kabobs were great and had a nice level of heat. They were more flavorful than Mediterranean lamb chunks on skewers. The menu is not as expansive as some Chinese restaurants in the immediate area. The food is consistently good. I have dined with different groups of people and each time every person left happy. I would like more Asian and Arab foods fused.\\nI came here yesterday with my dear \\nfriend as an alternative to Christmas shopping at a mall. I had the time of my life. It was an epic day. I glanced at a review who said something about Grandma\\'s house. I damn near lost my mind when I saw the exact same, paint by number Jesus picture from the 40\\'s or 50\\'s that hangs in my Mother\\'s childhood bedroom in the basement of flower child. I had my friend snap a picture of Jesus and I and texted it to my Mom (see attached). She said she almost fell out of her bed when she received it. I picked up two pictures of some old guy with a white man afro bowling and a little statue that says \"World\\'s Greatest Mom\". I am giving that to my Mom for Christmas. Walking through the store is like stepping into a nice rift in time. We were talking about our experience there all night last night and we plan on returning today or soon.\\nI went to Falafel Cafe a few years ago. It was a one and done opportunity. Cleveland is a tale of two cities divided by the Cuyahoga River. The Arab immigrants in\\n Cleveland did not settle too heavily on the east side. I had my suspicions about Falafel Cafe because of that fact. I am sure the restaurant does well because of the student and hospital population. I will stick with west side places for Arab food. There is a place by Fairview Hospital called Cafe Falafel that is much better. Don\\'t get them confused.\\nThe Dome was an awesome place. I had a couple of really good times there. It was shaped like a giant dome, kind of like the Thunderdome. The table dances were negotiable. I never encountered that before or after the dome. There was only a couple people in there each time.\\nI used to frequent the Alesci\\'s downtown for lunch. I was glad that there is a store in Solon where I can grab some quick food on lunch at the new job. The food is good. I don\\'t really like the red sauce. The daily lunch special is a great deal for $6. It usually consists of a chicken or meat dish, two sides and garlic bread. There are plenty of Italian foods and things ', 'actual_label': 45, 'predicted_label': 45}, {'text': 'available for purchase. I think this place is great for the price.\\nThis is a nice dive bar. It is a good place to go and just drink some beers or shots. Good to drink alone, or with a friend or two. Don\\'t go crazy and invite a dude\\'s or girl\\'s night out here. They would want to leave. A few stoner friends said they ate mushrooms on a Tuesday night and came here a couple years ago. They said it was the weirdest night of their lives because some woman started screaming at them for no reason. That story alone should make people want to come here.\\nI have recently rediscovered Edgewater and glad that I have. It is not worth driving all the way out to Bay Village or Mentor to enjoy the beach when I have one a few miles away. I enjoyed myself on Sunday down there and was surprised that it was not very sketchy at all. I still won\\'t go in the water. A great place to go and catch some rays, throw a football or whatever it is you do.\\nA great addition to an area lacking in good places to drink. Th\\ne beer list is pretty solid. They had Stone Ruination on tap. I ordered the Stone IPA bottle, the bartender automatically poured me a taste of Ruination, which was like a low ball glass full of this delicious IPA. It was a very nice gesture to give out a free taste, even though I am more than familiar with that great beer. I am not much of a Martini drinker. They all sounded damn good though. A good date spot with a nice patio for drinking in the middle of a winter, lake effect snow storm.\\nI have been here for beers a few times in the past month. Today I finally tried the food. I took my mom out for dinner and she couldn\\'t believe how friendly the staff was. Many of them know me from my drinking at ABC so they each greeted me with a handshake and a hello. My mom knows I like to drink. Now she must think I am really like Barney from the Simpsons. The local drunk. Well, she is right. She ordered the open faced roast beef sandwich with \"Gluck\" sauce, which is the chef\\'s term for au jus. T\\nhe roast beef was excellent, just like a nice homemade roast. I ordered the jerk chicken sandwich, cheesy grits and broccoli. I enjoyed all of it. The jerk was a great seasoning, not too syrupy like the BW-3 sauce. I tried some of my mom\\'s Eddie Fitz French Onion, which was the Great Lakes Edmund Fitzgerald Stout and French onion soup. It was a terrific tasting soup. The food is fantastic, the service is the friendliest in town and the atmosphere is great. I am glad that they opened this place up. There are garage style doors on one side of the dining room and I can imagine how nice it will be on a warm summer night to drink some good beer, eat good food in the open air. A ton of IPA on draft.\\nThis is my favorite book store in Cleveland and I prefer it to the east side location. Copped Henry Miller Tropic of Cancer and Capricorn for $6 a piece. Now I attempt to reenact those books.\\nCarmino\\'s is delicious pizza. The crust is excellent, the sauce is decent, the cheese is also alright. My\\n friend says this is his favorite pizza in town and the chicken bacon ranch is the best. I would recommend going there and trying some pizza there. It is very cheap and good.\\nI had my wisdom teeth taken out over 10 years ago. This was the man that made that happen. I am glad that I did not chicken out and went through with it. I still think about that day. I am very skeptical about stuff like that and generally a nervous wreck around needles. He let me listen to my headphones while they were going to do whatever was needed to knock me out. I think his son was on my baseball team when I was a young boy. If so, this man saw me get knocked out by a line drive to the eye when I was pitching. If you need surgery on your mouth for something, don\\'t listen to a referral from some dentist or family member. Listen to PW on Yelp. I am a real person and this is a real review! My teeth turned out great!\\nLast week I came here after work. It is located right next door to the Malachi House, which is a\\nn awesome place. (I encourage anyone who reads this to go the Krusty\\'s Summer Sauce Camp in August. It is a benefit for this wonderful place.) The guy behind the bar was very welcoming. We talked about neighborhoods of Cleveland, food and life. He was really nice and a pleasure to meet. The Thai Coconut Soup was a good starter. The Panang Curry was fantastic. The food was good and I plan on becoming a regular. He gave me a take out menu. The music was also pleasant. The walls were painted in bright, warm colors. The building has a lot of character. I enjoyed the experience.\\nMy buddy and I took a couple of Dominican chicks to the shooting range the other week. I felt glad to empower the girl. She never held or shot a gun before. Like Nas said on \"I Gave You Power\", well, I gave her that power. I stood behind her and showed her proper form / stance. Yeah, it may have been a creep move to stand directly behind a girl while she shot a gun, but damned if she didn\\'t like it! Hanging out with', 'actual_label': 45, 'predicted_label': 45}, {'text': \"cked in brown paper and a modest tab of two toonies and a loonie paid I stepped into the street to enjoy my items and beginning first with the item suggested by the server I nearly went back inside to buy more as the Raspberry Custard Danish would prove to be the best Danish I've ever had - a flaky butter pastry stuffed with rich vanilla custard at its center plus a half-dozen ruby colored berries and a dusting of powdered sugar.  Soft and dense but with a light crackle along the edges plus soft hints of butter and cream melding with the slightly tart raspberries - it was remarkable to put it lightly.\\n\\nMoving next to my selections, well, when an outstanding almond croissant isn't the best pastry of the day you know you ordered right.  Beginning first with the croissant, a double-baked beauty loaded with sliced toasted almonds and a light dusting of powdered sugar, it was perhaps the messiest version of the pastry I've ever tasted as it shattered with each bite releasing crumbs, almonds\\n, and sugar in plethora.  With a soft center rife with butter and only a kiss of frangipane it was divine - I almost went back for another.  \\n\\nFor the final bite - the signature Kouign Amann, but this time different from those I'd experienced prior as the large butter pastry was actually a cheese-like wheel subsequently cut into slices with a crackling caramelized top and bottom surrounding what essentially tasted like butter and sugar suspended in air.  Light and perfect, texturally complex, and still warm - if you live within a roadtrip of Montreal this is reason enough to go (amongst so many others.)\\nItems Selected:\\nSlice of Pepperoni\\nGarlic Knots\\nEggplant Rollatini - Thinly Sliced Eggplant, Fried Golden, Stuffed with Housemade Ricotta and Mozzarella over Marinara\\nRed Velvet Cake\\nHalf-Order of Bombolini\\n\\nAs authentic as many New York slice shops despite its Westside location in Summerlin's Boca Park, East Side Pizza had been earmarked for a visit for some time when I entered its doo\\nrs on Saturday night and with football playing on two screens as fairly steady stream of foot traffic arrived for takeout the experience was as good as expected - no more and no less.\\n\\nClearly a locals-only sort of spot, despite ownership proudly declaring Big Apple roots, a visit to East Side Pizza begins at the end of a long counter where single slices are there to temp and with ordering available up front or seated at tables to the right I found myself a four-top where the Italian-American menu expanded well beyond the giant rings of dough being hand tossed by a duo of young men standing before ovens glowing electric orange.\\n\\nObviously there for the pizza, but also willing to sample a few appetizers along with, it was with recommendations from a friendly female server that my order was made and with little delay the meal began with the aforementioned slice, a classic pepperoni concoction with a bit of char, plenty of crunch, and a stream of grease pooling on the plate when folded to\\n take a bite.  Less successful, a followup of 'garlic knots' had none of the expected crunch and although reasonably laced with garlic butter the dinner-roll texture left me luke-warm, a sidecar of classic marinara improving the flavors only a smidge.\\n\\nAt this point experiencing a bit of delay due to several take-out orders occurring at once it was after perhaps twenty minutes of watching Oregon State and ASU that the $10 Eggplant Rollatini arrived and although meager in portion with only three thin slices of eggplant on a bed of marinara with a veil of cheese both the flavors and textures shined, a similar kind word offered to the rich cocoa tones of limited-edition Red Velvet Cake but completely inappropriate for thimble-sized 'bombolini' that lacked any semblance of yeasty nuance, instead presenting nothing but oily fried dough.\\n\\nFriendly service, save for an older woman jokingly spouting semi-racist epithets to the men spinning dough, and fairly good red sauce classics are the name\\n of the game at East Side Pizza and although never particularly sold on the idea that New York Style is a pie worth seeking out the version here is pretty close to the real deal while other options vary in quality and quantity compared to price paid.\\nPlates selected:\\n\\nWhite Bean Puree with Lavosh and Honey Rolls\\n\\nXL Sicky Bun with Baked Citrus Brioche, Honey Bourbon Sauce\\n\\nCrunchy Nutella French Toast with Caramelized Bananas and Whipped Cream\\n\\nFilet Mignon Stacked Slider with Scrambled Eggs, Creamed Spinach, Beehive Cheddar, Roast Breakfast Potatoes\\n\\nWarm Bread Pudding with Bourbon Toffee Sauce, Honey, and Salted Whipped Cream\\n\\nReturning to dining after a bit of shopping our arrival at the highly touted Honey Salt for brunch was met by the expected crowd - the large, warm, and rustic dining room near full - but unexpectedly by one of the coldest hostesses I've ever encountered; enough that we nearly considered walking out until another young woman stepped in, welcomed us and assured u\", 'actual_label': 46, 'predicted_label': 46}, {'text': 's it would be only a short wait for a table, and subsequently seated us in the center of the dining room.  Say what you will about \"first impressions,\" this was the sort that most certainly stuck out and probably colored the rest of the \\'experience\\' aspect of Honey Salt - service lacking in nearly all regards as our waitress, Julie, neglected both empty glasses and dirty plates as she bustled around the room.\\n\\nMoving past service snafus to that which was presented on the plate I must say that things improved dramatically as soon as the bread basket arrived and focusing mostly on the sweet half of the menu crafted by Chef Esmeralda Serrano - whose work I was familiar with from her time at Tableau - every single plate that landed on our table was outstanding, particularly the Monkey Bread style sticky bun whose delicate balance of light acidity and sweet honey wowed with each bite and the thick, custard laden bread pudding whose richness found levity in a puffy cloud of whipped cream fle\\ncked with salt.  Not generally one to order savory at breakfast/brunch, it should be noted that even my friend\\'s sliders were excellent - the beef so tender that it formed a sort of smoky stew/scramble with the fluffy eggs and cheese.\\n\\nHaving heard similar negativity about the service at Honey Salt I should only hope they iron out these kinks sooner rather than later because much like Raku this is cuisine more than capable of competing with the best of what can be found on the strip, but in order to be worth the travel a front of house matching the skills in the kitchen will be indispensable.\\nItems Selected:\\nCrispy Duck with Roasted Peanuts\\nPork Belly with Roasted Peanuts\\nShrimp Ball with Mayo\\nChive Dumpling\\nAlmond Coated Shrimp with Mayo\\nSteamed Pork Bun\\nHar Gow\\nShumai\\nBaked Pork Bun\\nBaked Coconut Bun\\nEgg Custard\\nStuffed Eggplant\\nPan Fried Red Bean Cake\\nRed Bean Donut\\nRed Bean Bun\\n\\nFound inside the Gold Coast Casino, and said by some to offer the best Dim Sum in a City oft lamented fo\\nr lacking anything on par with other locations of similar size, it was with three friends that an 11:00am arrival was planned at Ping Pang Pong -

an admitted rarity in during peak hours at restaurants serving in this style.\\n\\nCharging approximately 25% more than other similar spots in town, and failing to nail the standards despite executing a few items quite well, Ping Pang Pong is just another average Dim-Sum joint intended to cater to the growing Asian tourist popul', 'actual_label': 46, 'predicted_label': 46}, {'text': 'ation, a better option for those confined to casinos found at nearby KJ in the Rio while those with a car would be well served to check out Chang\\'s just a mile and a half to the North.\\nItems Selected:\\nPortofino Ristorante 6\\nOlive Oil Soaked Focaccia\\nCaprese Salad -

perhaps as a result of the season - it was with the Chef standing tableside that a five-piece pasta course was pre\\nsented, smoothness exemplified by Burrata Agnolotti offering perfect little pockets mixed with big chunks of Lobster  while last year\\'s Chicken Foie-Fredo saw a big textural upgrade by way of crispy Chicken Chicharones tossed with Hand-cut Fettucine and strips of tender white Meat glistening in unctuous Alfredo.\\n \\nTransitioning the wide-ribboned Ripatelli to winter by way of Wild Boar Bolognese while making a hearty pass at the Midwestern slow-cooker classic inside of tiny Ravioli, a tongue-in-cheek swipe at the \"Official flavor of Fall\" came across in LaPlaca\\'s ever-light Dumplings, a Ragu of braised Reindeer offering a slight bit of grassy funk that found its foil in thin slices of Beets along with charred Brussels Sprout Leaves and housemade Gingerbread Crumble.\\n\\nAlways happy to see Portofino\\'s Veal Osso Bucco, perhaps not Sin City\\'s most famous but arguably the best, new secondi offered Day Boat Scallops amidst Cauliflower Florets and smoked Pork with spicy Popcorn on a bed of smoo\\nth Polenta, the Rack of Lamb perfectly roasted medium with a round of smooth Stuffing plus Figs added for sweetness, the Strauss Brands Veal served slightly different from last visit\\'s \"Veal Pacino\" with a lower price, similar size and better flavor than the one jokingly referenced in the unofficial off-menu-only title.\\n\\nDisappointed to see that desserts have regressed, the pastry department once again undergoing change as a result of the shared nature with other restaurants within the Casino, both the Tiramisu and Crème Brûlée remain competent closers, though the loss of Cassata Cake and the Cookie-based Souffle trio are issues that management should look into remedying as soon as possible.\\n\\n***** As innovative as ever, the Pastas and Entrees continuing to shine on a nation-wide level despite the constraints of playing to The Mirage clientele, it seems shortsighted that management would invest time in changing the name when a fresh coat of paint and good pastry Chef could offer expone', 'actual_label': 46, 'predicted_label': 46}, {'text': 'ntial improvement at nominal cost, though as long as Chef LaPlaca and Chris Zadie are involved there is no doubt the restaurant will continue to impress.\\nWith proteins accounted for and rounds made of the art show my next stop was dessert and although there were other choices available the only logical choice in my mind was Mamma Toledo\\'s, a spot I\\'d been meaning to visit since I arrived in Phoenix not only because the name matched my home town but because the eclectic assortment of pies available in three sizes all sounded great - particularly after reading owner/operator Tonya Saidi\\'s roundabout way of arriving at a job she truly seems to love.\\n\\nA small truck - largely a delivery mechanism for pies made at home - the selection of pies at Mamma Toledo\\'s on Saturday morning consisted of six pies, two pie bites, plus a cup o\\' cake and while every single one sounded good it was the Chocolate Coffee Pie and Carrot Cup o\\' Cake that immediately caught my attention - an $8 tab that weighed i\\nn at a substantial half a pound but far more in terms of quality and flavor.\\n\\nBeginning first with the cup o\\' cake, I have no idea what carrot to flour ratio Tonya used to make this beautiful item, but with the cake itself dense, bright orange, and sweet while remaining vegetal the self-described \"Pie baking specialist\" proved to possess a deft hand with non-pies as well - the cream cheese frosting adding a slight tang without overwhelming and the subtleties of the cake; pretty much everything one could ask from carrot cake and entirely without the nuts or raisins so many others rely on to liven up the mix.\\n\\nMoving next to the pie - let it first be said that if you\\'ve not experienced Mamma Toledo\\'s crusts then you should search for her truck right now and order whatever sounds best because no matter what sort of pie you fancy her crusts are superlative- flaky like a croissant, loaded with butter, and crisp enough to support the filling without being \\'hard.\\'  Moving next to the filling,\\n while I can only speak to the single pie I tasted I\\'ll simply say that this was great - a thick pudding of cocoa and espresso with a light cream topping that helped to mellow the bitter notes without overwhelming them at all - the only thing missing was a cup of coffee to wash it down...or maybe some ice cream; either way I can\\'t wait to go back for more.\\nSuffice it to say that I am not an expert on cocktails, lounges, or trendy places to hang out and sip exotic alcohol, but save for the overly loud pianist competently taking and playing requests I really liked the vibe of BLVD in the Linq.  Paying a visit just prior to dinner at Brooklyn Bowl it was to smiling service and a well culled menu of craft cocktails that we arrived and with Bob Dylan and The Beatles played loudly beneath the glowing lightbulb cloud my $14 Cocojito proved excellent - the high top notes of lime and mint giving way to a citrus Bacardi base softened by rich frothed coconut milk.  With friends equally impressed \\nby a classic Manhattan and a spicy jalapeno vodka cocktail there is little doubt this place is prone for success, though a few less decibels would have been ideal for conversation.\\nHappy to support any restaurant that continues to evolve, tweak, and reinvent even when it is already outperforming anything similar in the market, it took little more than seasonal menu updates to bring myself and six friends back to The Mirage\\'s Portofino and with Chef Michael LaPlaca continuing to amuse palates with a total of twenty plates, including four new pastas, no real descriptor can encompass just how great the evening was, the service better than ever even as Chris Zadie and team saw over 180 walk-ins without missing a step.\\n\\nAgain sat at a table overlooking the dining room floor, music and scenery unchanged from the past while a buzz hung in the air from a mostly-full house, it was to a family-style carte blanche experience that our meal was entrusted and passing on wine in favor of Iced Tea it \\nwas not more than fifteen minutes before the fun got started, a seasonal beet salad with beautiful candied pistachios juxtaposing creamy goat cheese joining several old-favorites, the meatballs deemed better than ever by some at the table while the soup managed the rare feat of beans being perfectly cooked while pasta was still springy yet tender.\\n\\nUnabashedly promoting LaPlaca as the most innovative pasta maker in Las Vegas, a title earned across three prior meals where not one noodle or sauce failed to impress, November\\'s new menu saw some similarities but mostly different offerings and although the Agnolotti remains the sort of signature MGM should be touting on billboards it was once again the Gnocchi that stole away the spotlight, the Thanksgiving Feast on a plate every bit as \\'fun\\' as it was delicious beneath dehydrated stuffing crumbles while \"Pappardella alla Vodka\" required no tableside show to induce a smile, just great sauce and huge langoustines with butter and booze kept g', 'actual_label': 46, 'predicted_label': 46}, {'text': 'rounded by sauteed spinach greens. \\n\\nAlready seeing some at the table scaling back on portions in order to enjoy more of that to come, secondi featured three classics joined by two more recent innovations and although the Osso Bucco remains the best in the city while the fried lobster tail is a luxury that anyone with the means should go out of their way for it would be equally difficult to pass up buttery scallops atop cauliflower puree with cubes of fried polenta, let alone the flash fried pork shank that is not exactly \"Italian\" but no less likely to wow atop a sweet and smoky bean ragu.\\n\\nCurrently in flux as relates to the pastry department, options unchanged from the past yet still just as good, it was perhaps good fortune that saw only a small smattering of sweets served after such an epic meal and with the Cassata Cheesecake as well as the Crème Brulee drawing oohs-and-ahhs from the uninitiated it seems to me that even the deconstructed cannoli tasted better this time around, th\\ne filling  more creamy than memory serves and the citrus notes turned down.\\n\\n*****Continuing to challenge themselves while still impressing tourists and locals alike the simple volume of glowing praise for Portofino should be proof enough of a restaurant worth a visit, each and every menu change likely to prompt my next.\\nMore than a touch impressed by the quality of sourcing, service, and execution during a family-style meal at Portofino earlier this year it was without question that the newly launched Spring menu was more than enough an impetus to return, and opting to enjoy the finely crafted flavors in tasting menu format while watching Game 2 of the Stanley Cup Finals in the lounge the ten new savories and three desserts sent forth by Michael LaPlacca again proved to be some of the city\\'s most dazzling, not one less than meticulously crafted from some of the very best ingredients around.\\n\\nHaving previously discussed the restaurant\\'s design, and as such left here to focus only on th\\ne cuisine, suffice it to say that service at the bar was bolstered by the Chef himself presenting each dish with full description straight from the kitchen and starting off with a fig salad marrying the flavors of roasted banana to creamy gorgonzola while cutting the fruit\\'s sweetness with acid a high bar was set, the follow-up of wild caught squid snappy beneath light breading with a melt-in-the-mouth texture discovered just as tooth broke skin.\\n\\nEnthralled with the housemade pastas during visit one, and as such treated to one each of the new creations over the course of the next hour, it was entirely as a result of the dish\\'s primary ingredient that a full portion of the decadent raviolo draped in truffle and speck was presented, and precisely as rich as one expect from a dish of its constituents it was predictably still a tossup as to whether the rest were any less exquisite - the signature ripatelli and ribbons of pappardelle in a sauce of foie gras and cream each boiled to a perfe\\nct al dente while potato gnocchi were feather light alongside crispy offal in a gravy of earthy aromatics amongst butter and tender beans.\\n\\nOnward to secondi, the majority of the new plates featuring a seasonally appropriate seafood slant, it was admittedly a surprise that a supple cut of salmon atop a polenta cake found such an amicable partnership with fresh peas in two forms, and although perhaps a bit overcooked with the center just past raw a duo of seared scallops proved equally well accompanied, the lightly cooked lettuce reminiscing the flavors of chow mein while crisp bits of caramelized onion helped meld the otherwise robust savory tones.\\n\\nThankfully spared a \\'steak and potatoes\\' dish that Michael teased was requisite for a boy from Cleveland as such a thing would have undoubtedly cut short later indulgence at dessert, course  nine featured a pounded cut of pork beneath zesty caponata and although the golden breading over soft flesh undoubtedly shined in its own right, it sim\\nply couldn\\'t compare to the crisp scales overlying Branzino - each flaky bite rivaling the signature Sea Bass at Guy Savoy at half the price with a baton of creamy potatoes one would be hesitant to have to share.\\n\\nAdmittedly finding desserts during the first visit a bit blasé when compared to that which came before, suffice it to say that spring has seen a substantial upgrade in Portofino\\'s sweets and although the Tiramisu still remains for those fancying a classic the better decision is to take the paths less traveled, a trio of soufflés themed in American cookies standing proud, fluffy, and perfect for sharing while a Nutella crème brûlée was expectedly rich beneath caramelized nuts and lightly boozed cream, the  \\'cake within a cake\\' undeniably the most interesting of the group with seasonal berries and a delicate ricotta sponge wrapped in a thin wall of New York style cream cheese.\\n\\nStill a hidden gem in a world of celebrity chefs one would be foolish to overlook the confidence of P', 'actual_label': 46, 'predicted_label': 46}, {'text': 'ortofino in putting forth \"by Michael LaPlacca\" as part of its name, and without the fanfare of

service, and creativity, plus the name on the door standing over the stove.\\n...visit for the pants and fitted dress shirts in the days before and after Christmas.

Friendly service, willing to take custom orders, and not overly-stuffed and un-navigatable like some other organic/natural stores in the city.\\nItems Selected:\\nSliced Fatty Brisket, Pulle',

Harbor Airport, the line at Little Miss BBQ already twenty-deep and soon to swell well past two-hundred before the restaurant's doors opened up.\\n\\nSpawned from the world of Competition BBQ, one of the owners' Austin-roots infusing the team with passion and perspective no different from the Franklins and Muellers of the world, Little Miss BBQ represents the dream of Scott and Bekke Holmes - a Pitmaster with a culinary degree and his wife who has helped both as inspiration and in the kitchen.\\n\\nOpened in February of 2014, patrons and accolades flooding the industrial storefront ever since, a trip to Little Miss BBQ will be immediately familiar to those who've dine\\nd at Texas' best, the wood piles rimming the parking lot ready to be loaded into an offset smoker straight from Texas, the laminated outdoor menu promising everything from sliced Brisket, pulled Pork and Turkey to jumbo Beef Ribs.\\n\\nOne-upping many from the Lone-star State by making their spicy-Sausage on-site, samples whetting appetites as a young server circulated the line a few minutes before their eleven o'clock opening, it was precisely as the minute-hand reached 12 that the line lurched forward, several far-back letting out a small cheer even though they would spend yet another hour in anticipation.\\n\\nPerhaps a bit more packed than usual, the week between Christmas and New Year's plus a Fiesta Bowl crowd making a long weekday lunch more accessible to some, it was on approach of the counter that the crowd watched meats unloaded from the smoker get wrapped in foil or butcher paper, the moist Protein again revealed by Chef Holmes in a slow and methodical manner as orders are placed, e\\nach tray or plate lined and tared as he smiles and thanks fans while handing out small bites and occasional burnt-ends to those most fortunate.\\n\\nKeeping the menu simple, Meats by the pound or combo-plates featured alongside four Sides, classic Condiments and one Dessert, it was to a grand tally of $54 that nearly four pounds of Barbeque plus one of each side was taken to an indoor table, glasses of water filled from an outside cooler with three housemade Sauces ready in waiting.\\n\\nStruck by the humble vibe, but not about to waste anymore time before tucking into the Fatty Brisket that Scott's knife had glided through like Butter, comparisons to Aaron Franklin immediately became apparent as the peppery bark gave way to pure decadence, the prime-grade Beef more than juystifying its cost, as does the sizable Cow Rib with such a deep ring of smoke that it barely adhered to the bone beneath it.\\n\\nMore impressed by the warm sides than chilled ones, spicy Grits as smooth as they get while Pinto\\n Beans are upgraded by a substantial amount of Meat, Little Miss BBQ's pulled-Pork and Spare-Ribs are also as good as the majority found outside Kansas City, the latter slipping cleanly from the bone with each made even better by the restaurant's Tomato-based Hot Sauce while Bekke's Pecan Pie made a believer of even someone who claims not to enjoy such things, the smoked top-layer of Nuts helping to mellow a Maple and Brown Sugar Jam bottom.\\nRebranded in mid-2014 under the direction of GM Chris Zadie and Chef Michael LaPlaca, with pastry contributions from the team at nearby Heritage Steak, Portofino achieved a lot of recognition over the last few months thanks to stories of their 'diamond and gold' lasagna, but a closer look at the menu and words from friends in the know indicated there was much more to the story than savvy marketing, the native Ohioan toque reportedly turning out some of the best Italian food in the city with nearly everything from pastas and sauces made in house.\\n\\nP\\nreviously known as Onda, and still sporting much of the original space's design, it was just moments before 6:30 when myself and two others sat down at the bar in wait for two more and with a friendly bartender offering up drinks and fluffy focaccia alongside lightly grassy olive oil blended with balsamic it would not be long before our group was complete, a white linen table on the upper level of the main dining room  seemingly miles away from not only the Casino beyond, but also the Wildcats and Badgers playing on silent televisions in the lounge.\\n\\nLarge in size, with a palate of beige highlighted by lines of cursive decorating the walls, it was mere seconds after seating that Mr. Zadie greeted our table and with wine from one friend already decanted the party's likes and dislikes were discussed,  a family style tasting to follow as light music played overhead.\\n\\nDivided into four courses, specifically antipasti, pasta, secondi, and dolci, it would not be long before the first round o\", 'actual_label': 46, 'predicted_label': 46}, {'text': 'f food arrived and with Chef LePlaca personally presenting all four plates the descriptions were lengthy discourses clearly showing the young toque\\'s passion for everything from sourcing to plating, each dish putting a unique spin on something traditional and familiar in order to show the concepts and ingredients in new light.\\n\\nStarting with salad and progressing to more substantial things, antipasti began with a Caprese punctuated by sundried rounds of tomato and garlic that acted to accentuate, rather than hide, the musky funk of fresh buffalo mozzarella and moving on to the signature crabcakes feigning as arancini one couldn\\'t help but smile at the whimsy or diversity of flavors, a far more \\'serious\\' composition found in the upcoming spring starter of tender octopus glazed in old balsamic atop spicy hash while the supple meatballs topped in stuffed squash blossoms made a strong case for best in Sin City, the pungent duo of cheeses melding effortlessly to bright tomato puree below.\\n\\n\\nRepeatedly celebrated for their pastas, at least two now considered Strip-side staples, it was next in a quintet of family-style plates that we would indulge and eschewing a trend for undersaucing that seems more and more pervasive these days not a single option was less than superlative, the gnocchi so light they threatened to float off the plate were it not for the rich fonduta while tender agnolotti were every bit as creamy and decadent as ingredients would suggest, the rest of the lot textbook al dente with both the carbonara and fettuccini textbooks renditions while the signature wide-noodle \\'ripatelli\\' performed a rarity with lamb, rendering it aromatic and vegetal as opposed to so rich as to overwhelm.\\n\\nAt this point allowed to choose secondi as dictated by hunger, a total of three entrees were selected and although the seared Branzino with two types of cauliflower alongside crispy mushrooms and polenta was flawlessly prepared it simply lacked the lust-inducing satisfaction of t\\nwo other proteins, the osso buco defining the phrases \\'fall off the bone\\' and \\'cut with a spoon\\' atop creamy risotto while the upscaled take on Chicken Parm is a destination dish for any fan of the classic, a housemade sausage of leg and thigh wrapped inside a roulade of Mary\\'s Free Range breast coated in the lightest of breadings beneath marinara and melted mozzarella.\\n\\nAdmittedly full at this point, the veal substantial enough to go around the table twice, it was finally in desserts that the meal concluded and with the hour just past 9:00pm as coffee was served my joke about \\'all of them\\' proved a case of being careful what you ask for, five plates of dolci arriving at once with the semifreddo undoubtedly the most well conceptualized while the tiramisu was a surprising delicate take on the classic with light notes of cocoa, espresso, and cream lingering on the palate long after a meal that ranks highly amongst my favorites this year.\\n\\nNot yet a complete vision, the décor and desserts\\n yet to be fully realized for an entirely new name and brand, Portofino is perhaps the most interesting take on \"American\" Italian food I\\'ve seen attempted to date and with a young and passionate team operating both the kitchen and front of house the question simply becomes one of filling a large dining room tucked away in the back corner of The Mirage, a gem becoming less hidden as more people discover the creativity and sing its praise.\\nItems selected:\\n\\nCoffee\\nPeach Coffee Cake\\nMonte Cristo - Turkey, Ham, Swiss\\nPeanut Butter Stuffed French Toast - Peanut Butter Cream Cheese Filling, Honey, Bananas\\nCroissant

have to say the kitsch décor and happy holiday tunes contrasted severely with weary and disinterested service the food itself was quite good.  Clearly known for their daily interpretations\\n of classical coffee cake I will admit that I was a tad put off by both the microwaving and obvious use of canned peaches (as well as artificial syrup sitting on the counter) but speaking only to flavor the cake truly is as good as the rumors; light as angel food but topped with sugary streusel and rife with fruit.  Moving next to three plates divided and shared the kitchen again proved more than competent with diner classics and although ingredient quality could certainly be better the fried Monte Cristo was a truly faithful rendition of the classic yet not overly greasy while the French toasts were each rich and flavorful, the croissant version compromised by mushy blueberries but loaded with butter while peanut butter was a skilled kissed version of a childhood favorite, the sort of memories immune to ingredient quality or surly service and just plain delicious.\\nItems Selected:\\nGreen Tea Cookies\\nButter Bread\\nSweet Pecan Pie\\nRock Bun\\nMr. Kim Bun\\nUbe Cream\\nChoco-Honey Cake\\n\\nLocated ne', 'actual_label': 46, 'predicted_label': 46}, {'text': 'xt to latenight stalwart Ichiza, occupying the East corner of the second floor at 4355 Spring Mountain Road, Crown Bakery had long been a place on the local to-do list and with dim sum at Ping Pang Pong proving less than exhilarating it was largely on a whim that the decision was made to stop in, a smiling young lady more than happy to answer several questions and even going so far as to offer a pair of complimentary cookies atop the half-dozen items self-selected to check out the store\\'s wares.\\n\\nMost certainly no expert in Asian baked goods, a sweet tooth crafted in the Midwest far more attuned to American and European-styled pastry, it was with coffee in hand that a degustation of Crown\\'s buns and breads was undertaken and starting off with the crispy matcha cookies teaming with chopped nuts the restrained use of sugar was immediately evident, a texture not far from Italian Biscotti while the flavor profile trended herbal and lightly creamy - each bite actually well paired to the jav\\na, and likely even more appropriate alongside a pot of tea.\\n\\nAttempting best to see flavors progress from mild to rich it was with one cookie set aside that sights were turned to the appropriately named \"Butter Bread\" and as much as placing butter atop milk bread filled with cream filling may seem a good idea the use of a whole pad that stood solid simply seemed unnecessary, the additional calories far better invested in crispy wheels loaded with pralines and sprinkled with sugar, the flavor still less \\'sweet\\' than the Southern classic despite the title\\'s description, but delicious just the same.\\n\\nMoving next to a dense orb denoted as \"Rock Bread,\" suffice it to say there is probably no American item comparable to the amalgam of dried fruits, coconut, several types of nuts, and just enough flour to see it all bind tasted to date, and although a bit challenging to pull apart and eat the variety of flavors were exceedingly natural...perhaps even \\'healthy,\\' a followup \"Mr. Kim Bun\" featur\\ning a soft base laced in peanut butter and red bean paste obviously trending a bit more sugary though still quite mellow amidst the supple white base.\\n\\nAlways a fan of purple yam, it was with good fortune that despite arriving a few hours after noon there was still one Ube Cream Bun left on the shelf, and with a light coat of spelt decorating the outside for texture the flavor was every bit as good as expected, a half quickly eaten while the rest was consumed shortly after tasting the cocoa-honey \\'cake\\' that unfortunately proved a bit lackluster with texture not dissimilar to that of Wonderbread with neither flavor very pronounced.\\n\\nA bit hidden amidst one of Chinatown\\'s busiest plazas, but featuring several novelties with low prices and the sort of service that one rarely associates with Spring Mountain Road, Crown Bakery is a place well worth exploring for those interested in Asian baked goods, a full exploration of the scene yet to be undertaken but the results thus far a promising \\nstart.\\nWallflowers.  2 for $5 Brown sugar and Fig.  Don\\'t judge me.\\nItems Selected:\\nMaine Lobster Benedict - Poached Eggs, Lobster, Roasted Corn, Asparagus, Bacon Waffles, Béarnaise, Skillet Red Potatoes\\nChicken and Waffles - two fried chicken breasts, poached egg, bacon-scallion waffle, spiced maple syrup\\nRed Velvet Pancakes - White Chocolate Shavings, Chocolate Chip Nibs, Vanilla Cream Glaze\\nCaptain Crunch Coated Brioche French Toast - Salted Buttered Pecans, Caramelized Banana, Toffee, Maple Syrup\\n\\nLocated in The Wynn overlooking the resort\\'s lush gardens and pools Terrace Point Café had long been on my breakfast \\'to-do\\' list and with a Saturday morning meeting behind me our 9:00am arrival found myself and a friend squarely in the middle of the restaurant\\'s morning bustle, a friendly but overburdened server named Hector providing service for the subsequent two hours.

Beginning with butter-poached lobster atop savory waffles and a bed of fresh vegetables liberally topped with creamy béarnaise alongside two crispy fried chicken breasts stacked amidst supple waffles crowned with an egg and Crystal infused maple syrup suffice it to say that both ingredient sourcing and preparation  technique proved every bit worthy of Steve Wynn\\'s reputation and yet as good as these were the sweets that followed were even better, the crunch-yields-custard French Toast among the nation\\'s best even before adding pure maple syrup while the mountain of fluffy pancakes sandwiching layers of vanilla tinged cream cheese resembled a true Red Velvet cake big enough to share...amongst four.\\nItems Selected:\\nPunch, Drunk, Love - Mint Infused Hendricks G', 'actual_label': 46, 'predicted_label': 46}, {'text': 'in, Lillet Rose, Watermelon Juice, Lime Juice\\nKale Salad - Crispy Artichokes, Ricotta Salata, Warm Mushroom Vinaigrette\\nFrench Onion Soup - Gruyere Cheese, Baguette, Thyme\\nShrimp Risotto - Arugula, Tomato Fondue\\nSea Scallop Benny - Sunny-Side Quail Egg, Chorizo, Chipotle Hollandaise, Toast\\nLamb Meatballs - Lemon Yogurt, Pistachio Chimichurri\\nOctopus Ceviche - Grapefruit, Pickled Jalapenos\\nNana D\\'s Meatball Wood Fired Pizza - Oven Roasted Tomatoes, Pecorino\\nCrushed Fingerlings - Crème Fraiche, Chives\\nGrilled Salmon - Oyster Mushrooms, Carrot Miso Broth\\nBeef Hanger Steak - Crostini, Au Poivre Sauce\\nRicotta Gnocchi - Braised Short Rib, Pea Puree\\nSweet Elvis - Peanut Butter Flatbread, Banana, Bacon\\nNutella Squeeze - Ice Cream Sandwich with Chocolate Whipped Cream and Caramelized Hazelnut\\nChocolate Makeout - Warm Chocolate Fondant, Salted Caramel Cream, Peanut Brittle, Caramel Sauce\\n\\nWith a menu slightly more interesting than the average casino based small plates concept it was on the invit\\nation of a friend that I sat down for a public relations sponsored meal at MGM\\'s Crush and with the kitchen clearly catering to the head of the table as Chef DeMarco sent out several plates intended to impress the results were largely passable, a few hits amidst several \\'safe\\' presentations that had us all discussing the sweetbreads comments from the film \"Chef.\"  Obviously intended to wow the millennial crowd with a large menu of cocktails and \\'tapas\\' to be shared, the restaurant itself is of the loud variety and with high ceilings paired to minimal décor the long room echoes with the sounds of I Heart Radio as a youthful staff proves exceedingly efficient with excellent knowledge of the menu and recommendations thankfully far more useful than the typical \"everything is good.\"  Low in lighting aside from the lounge in back it was with an exceedingly refreshing cocktail that the meal began and although not entirely inventive both the soup and salad that followed were impressive in thei\\nr own right, the woodsy vinaigrette particularly memorable in its ability to upgrade an ingredient offered on almost every menu in town.\\n\\nMoving next to several items selected by the table before progressing to those sent out by the chef both the risotto and the scallops proved competent, if underwhelming, while the lamb meatballs were clumsy and off-balanced without a bit of funk - the lone standout of the group a stunning ceviche with heat and acid surrounding supple cephalopod paired to crisp chips with slight sweetness making all the flavors pop.\\n\\nImpressed by buttery flatbread beneath bright sauce that melded spiced meatballs to briny cheese it was actually the creamy crushed fingerlings that proved the best plate of the next round while overcooked salmon and steak both proved par for the course, the oft-raved gnocchi rounding out the savories with exceptional tenderness amidst hearty short ribs and au jus that entirely unfortunately overwhelmed any semblance of nuance that might \\nhave been added from pureed peas.\\n\\nAlways happy to over-order desserts it was with a trio of sweets that the meal wrapped up and while the $12 \"Sweet Elvis\" lived up to its name without any discernible savory notes added by the bacon both the \\'signature\\' Squeeze and unfortunately named \"Makeout\" faired far better - the former surprisingly subtle with no lack of textures and temperatures in play while the later was decidedly dessert-like, a not-quite molten center avoiding tired nomenclature and instead eating like sticky toffee pudding with slight salinity keeping richness in check.\\n\\nBacked by The N9NE Group and clearly gunning for the cocktail crowd without taking too many risks with the cuisine Crush serves its purpose and fills the small-plates niche for the MGM Grand admirably, its best utility likely as a place for drinks before KA for those unwilling to shell out the cash for L\\'Atelier and seeking an environment more trendy than what is offered at TAP; a lot of style, a bit of su\\nbstance, and a bill befitting its location.\\nContinuing a theme of French Pastries, but in a more modern light, our visit to Olivier Potier was similar to that at Le Fromentier in that our first visit, around 9:00am, found them with only breakfast pastries while a visit later in the day around 6:00pm found them entirely sold out of most of the dessert pastries aside from a few macarons - it was almost enough to make us give up, but a visit to the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts directly across the street would prove the adage of the \\'third time\\'s a charm\\' as we entered the semi-subterranean space to find a full array of options from the former Laduree (and so many other places) patissier.\\n\\nA small space, heavy on wood and brick, with pastries and breads up front plus a small seating area and café in back, the service at OP was impressive from the moment I walked in and with the young woman waiting patiently as I weighed my options she offered her advice to another gentleman who seemed conf', 'actual_label': 46, 'predicted_label': 46}, {'text': \"r prices make me walk through the door and their sushi keeps me coming back for more. And the sake? Well the sake just turns the night into a whole different story in itself,\\nToday I hosted a fiesta in my mouth with the cuisine at Taberna. And it's a fiesta that I wish could have continued on forever! Taberna has certainly sizzled their way into the Valley and all it takes is one taste of their food to know why. \\n\\nWith so much anticipation and excitement to try out Taberna, I rejoiced when it turned out to be everything I expected plus a bag (or bowl) of fabulous chips! So let me start with the chips. They serve plantain chips, yes plantain chips! They also serve crispy blue tortilla chips. The salsa is spot on and they provide a green and red salsa upon arrival. I ate my way through the meal by starting with the Tortilla soup. Holy Moly I love this soup. I could probably eat this soup all day every day and be happy. It's a cream-based tortilla soup oozing with cheese, avocado and othe\\nr Mexican spices. It's warm and spicy and delicious with every slurp. And yes, I was slurping it was so good. I couldn't get enough of the presentation either. It comes in a dainty little black kettle topped with even a lid! For my entree, I heard the steak tacos were to-die-for so I went that route. Verdict? Yes, yes they are to-die-for! They are mini but filling and they are fresh topped with tasty sauces. \\n\\nSo until next time Taberna ... and trust me, there will be many, many, many more next times!\\nAs my 1,000 review, I am going to review a home that was dear to my heart for several years. The location where I dated my husband, was a newly wed with my husband, and was pregnant with our first child. We were able to enjoy such a fun lifestyle when living at Optima and I think anyone who doesn't have kids should live in a place like here. \\n\\nI don't know if you should be allowed to write a review for a condo complex you never lived in and so I felt it was only right for me to write this\\n review as a former resident of the complex and not someone who just visits the common area or looked at one unit with a realtor. \\n\\nI lived here for several years and loved every minute of it. Location, ambiance and amenities are all tied up into one nice little package here. Of course it's obvious that the location of this complex is perfect because it's walking distance to everything. My husband and I spent years enjoying Old Town Scottsdale on foot and there were some weekends when I didn't drive my car once. You can walk to the mall, restaurants, bars, parks and more. I think it provides the feel of urban living, at least as much as you can feel like you're living an urban lifestyle in Arizona. \\n\\nAs a former resident of Optima, I can say that the amenities were some of the best I've ever experienced. Who needs a gym membership when you have a full gym, indoor pool, indoor basketball courts, indoor racquet ball courts, a putting green and two outdoor pools? It felt like I lived in a\\n resort. To add to the resort feel, we also had a concierge service that would help us make reservations, answer questions, etc. They were always so sweet and I enjoyed stopping in to say hi and grab my packages. Every condo had underground parking which meant that our cars never had to be victim to the horrendous heat during summer months. I never once had to wince while getting into my burning hot car and as soon as I parked, I would take the elevator up directly to my floor and my unit. \\n\\nThe units are all different so I won't review our condo itself, but we loved living in our modern condo and it's perfect for a young couple without kids or a retired couple who wants to be close to everything. \\n\\nOptima holds a special place in my heart because I lived here during some very important times of my life and what an incredible place to call home during that time!\\nSacks has a great sandwich. Shocking right? But they do and I'll tell you why I like to visit. During the week, often times I\\n am running from meeting to meeting and when lunchtime hits and I'm hungry, I just want to get in and out with a good sandwich in hand. At Sacks, I can do this. It reminds me of another sandwich shop I've been to in another city and I was incredibly happy when I realized the similarities.\\n\\nI enjoy every sandwich I order at Sacks, especially ones that have cream cheese on them. The sandwiches are the perfect lunch size and not overwhelmingly large that leads to a food coma. A sacks sandwich also comes with a cookie which is an added bonus. The pricing is decent and I can enjoy a nice meal at an economic price in a quick manner. Does it get much better for lunch on the go?\\n\\nSo in summary of my short and sweet and to the point review, my suggestion is that next time you are on the go and looking for a good place to find a sandwich quickly, check out Sacks.\\nFat kids at heart unite at this buffet. Where else can you have eggs benedict, pizza and Chinese food all in one sitting? Why here of \", 'actual_label': 47, 'predicted_label': 47}, {'text': 'course! Add in the bottomless Mimosas on Saturday and you\\'ve got yourself one gluttonous meal. I ate myself silly here and enjoyed every bite. Believe it or not, their pizza is amazing. Give it a try! This is a plentiful meal with unlimited food options and you can easily eat yourself into a food coma. If you are looking for a fatty meal in Vegas, this is your spot.\\nLocal furniture shopping at its finest! In the midst of prepping for baby to be, we are also in the middle of moving into a new house which means furniture shopping. Luckily a place like Ladlow\\'s exists. \\n\\nFirst off, this is a local store that\\'s been in the Valley for 14+ years. They carry furniture of all shapes, styles, sizes and most importantly, prices! Yes, you can walk away spending an arm and a leg, but you can also leave with some beautiful furniture that doesn\\'t break the bank. They have everything from classic furniture and modern furniture, to furniture that can fill a mansion as well as a condo. In addition to t\\nheir variety of price options, they also offer great sales and most of the time, half the furniture is marked down. \\n\\nWhen we first walked in, we were greeted by friendly Bob who guided us through the store and then helped us with our purchases. He offered the perfect amount of customer service. He was friendly and helpful but not overbearing. He\\'s a veteran employee of the store, so he knows his way around and he knows the inventory inside and out. \\n\\nWe left with some major purchases to help us move into our new home and I have a feeling we\\'ll be back for another trip or two! If you\\'re looking for new furniture, stop by Ladlow\\'s and be sure to ask for Bob!\\nI finally had the chance to eat at the new Wildflower location today and all I can say is bravo Wildflower. Another job well done. \\n\\nFirst, the location. This area needed a Wildflower badly and I plan on adding this to my weekend rotation immediately. Wildflower went above and beyond for the customer\\'s needs at this location. Did yo\\nu know that each booth has multiple power outlets so that you can plug your computer in from pretty much anywhere in the restaurant? For anyone who works on the go, they know how much of a godsend this is. If a shop doesn\\'t have enough power outlets, they can lose customers quickly because a computer battery only lasts so long! The restaurant is incredibly spacious and even though there was a line out the door, I found a seat right away because it\\'s big enough to accommodate the large crowds. \\n\\nSo speaking of large crowds, apparently Scottsdale got the Wildflower memo because it was swarming with lunch goers! But the Wildflower staff did a fabulous job with getting each customer in and out in an efficient manner. They didn\\'t rush anyone but they knew how to handle the crowd. Once I got through the line, I was impressed with the friendly and fast service. \\n\\nLike other Wildflower locations, the food is fabulous as usual. The bread is fresh and soft. And the salads and sandwiches are stil\\nl tasty. Today, I noticed adorable mini cakes in the case. They would make for a perfect miniature birthday cake for a friend or coworker! I also noticed the arrival of pumpkin chocolate chip muffins. Let pumpkin season begin my friends!\\nThis store is an organizer\\'s heaven! I have visited the Container Store here and there over the years and every time I visit, I find myself immersed in a world that\\'s begging me to be more organized in life. The Container Store has it all and I mean everything. The store is organized based on area of the house, so there is an area for kitchens, offices, bedrooms, closets, etc. They have items I didn\\'t even know existed and I don\\'t know how I lived without! It\\'s easy to do some serious monetary damage at the Container Store, but luckily they keep the prices pretty reasonable and offer some great sales. I don\\'t know what else to say about my favorite organizational store. If you like to organize, need to get organized, or simply want to do some retail da\\nmage, just peek into the Container Store!\\nWhen the weather\\'s nice, this is the perfect shopping center and when the weather makes eggs fry on the sidewalk, I suffer through the heat because their quality of shopping is just that good. \\n\\nKierland Commons is pretty much a one-stop shopping destination. Equipped with great dining destinations, retail for every level of pocket book spending, shopping for your home and shopping to satisfy your literary cravings, they have something for everyone here. One a sunny day, I love to park at Kierland Commons and browse the different shops. The Tommy Bahamas restaurant takes me to Hawaii for a brief moment and Anthropologie teaches me how to be fashionably eclectic. \\n\\nThe \"common\" area of Kierland Commons is a great place to sit and rest your weary feet and enjoy the water features going on around you. During the summertime, they launched a summer concert series and while I haven\\'t had a chance to attend, I was thrilled to hear that they were creat', 'actual_label': 47, 'predicted_label': 47}, {'text': 'ing fun activities for locals during summer months. Kierland Commons also does a wonderful job hosting events like Taste in the springtime. By closing the streets within the Commons, they create a foodie\\'s paradise with samplings and cocktails galore. \\n\\nKierland Commons has stunning architecture and it\\'s always nice to take a walk through the vicinity. Palm trees line the streets and shops welcome you with opens arms...or should I say hands asking for your dollars! The vicinity has plenty of parking and while it gets crowded on a weekend afternoon, it never feels too congested except possibly during the holiday season. \\n\\nSo if you haven\\'t visited Kierland Commons yet, you should add it to your list. But save your pennies before you visit because you\\'ll want to leave with arms full of shopping bags!\\nI\\'ve been to Italy and there\\'s not much that compares to Caprese that melts in your mouth upon the first bite. Authentic Italian food and especially groceries are hard to find, but Defalco\\'s\\n has it perfected. They even have the Caprese and mouthwatering mozzarella down! I walk in and I feel like I\\'ve entered a small market in Italy. If only they could find a way to place the Spanish Steps outside their door. :) \\n\\nIf you are looking for a tasty sandwich to brighten your day, Defalco\\'s is a great choice. They offer delectable catering that competes with my Grandma\\'s and practically any Italian dish or food item you can think of. Although it\\'s a bit on the pricey side, it\\'s well worth it for the quality you receive.\\nDon\\'t ask my why, but I was pleasantly surprised and not expecting to find a place like the Living Room hidden on Queen Creek Road. But, I\\'m happy to see that it exists! \\n\\nWhen I arrived, the exterior looked like a winery and should have been surrounded by grapevines instead of parked cars. I walked through the entry of large wooden doors and to the left drinkers lounged in an open bar area while restaurateurs ate in the surrounding tables. The atmosphere was coz\\ny and true to a wino\\'s environment with dark wood and wine everywhere. The restaurant was surrounded by a patio equipped with my favorite: fire places! Since it was a cold night, a fire place was a perfect touch. \\n\\nAt first it seemed like we were under dressed for the atmosphere, but after looking around in more depth, I noticed that people were dressed in everything from Scottsdale bar goer clothes to jeans and t-shirts. So I came to the conclusion that like more places in AZ, any attire goes as long as your clothed. \\n\\nThe food was decent for the type of food they offer. We shared the bruschetta trio to start which was similar to other wine bars I\\'ve visited. I went the salad route which was like a Mary Poppins salad because it didn\\'t seem to ever disappear! The sandwiches also looked tasty but if you\\'re hungry with an appetite, I suggest getting an appetizer with your entree. Men, do go here expecting a hearty meal. I would suggest ordering two appetizers and your entree if you\\'re re\\nally hungry. \\n\\nSo in summary, this really did feel exactly like a living room and now I want to check out their newest location on 7th!\\nJust recently, my sister needed a cake and asked me where to go. Knowing my sister\\'s likes (since they are similar to mine), I immediately screamed, \"Nothing Bundt Cakes!\" \\n\\nLet me explain why I heart Nothing Bundt Cakes. The cakes are moist and best eaten when cold. Random yes, but there\\'s a great combination of cold and moisture when you eat them that way. My favorite cake is the chocolate chunk. It has real legit chunks of chocolate in there. As if the cake wasn\\'t good enough before, the chunks just add to its splendor. Their red velvet is delicious, their basic bundt cake is delectable...really anything you over there is scrumptious heaven with every bit. They are traditional looking bundt cakes just like your Grandma would make. They have the freshest ingredients and are reasonably priced. \\n\\nThe frosting deserves its own paragraph. I love frosting\\n. It\\'s a weird addiction that I refuse to fix. The creamy cream cheese type frosting is the best and Nothing Bundt Cakes has it mastered. Sometimes with bundt cakes, the frosting is lacking but not here. Their frosting is perfectly placed on the cake and accompanies the cake just right. \\n\\nI like Nothing Bundt Cakes for birthday parties or even to just satisfy a sweet tooth craving when its just one of those fatty days. The cake is worth every single calorie. I promise.\\nHow did it take me so long to discover the Gypsy Bar? It\\'s an adult arcade after-all and my kind of fun! Located behind Lucky Strike, this bar is an arcade that serves alcohol. It reminds me of a mini version of the ESPN Zone. They have a great selection of games including air hockey, skee ball, basketball, car racing, guitar hero and my favorite game of all? Group PAC Man! My only qualm with this bar is that they don\\'t dedicate the entire bar to the arcade. It\\'s a lot of fun and a great way to enjoy a night of cocktails', 'actual_label': 47, 'predicted_label': 47}, {'text': ' through a fun activity. \\n\\nWe went on a Thursday night so it wasn\\'t crowded but I also noticed a dance floor which could be fun on weekend nights. But you won\\'t find me on the dance floor, you\\'ll find me having PAC Man fever in the arcade. Between Gypsy Bar and Lucky Strike (not to mention Stand Up Live), this area is guaranteed fun for a night out. If you see me there, I\\'ll challenge you to a game of air hockey!\\nDon\\'t be fooled into thinking the Arizona Science Center is just for kids. I\\'ve been both with my nephew and with fellow \"big kids\" aka adults. Every time I go, I have a blast and it\\'s not necessary to borrow your friend\\'s child in order to find an excuse to go. The Science Center is equivalent to some of finest science centers across the nation with their state of the art technology, interactive exhibits and activities for all ages. \\n\\nDuring past visits, I\\'ve enjoyed traveling exhibits like the Titanic exhibit years ago. As you entered, they gave you a piece of paper with a n\\name on it. As you walked through the exhibit you looked for the name and learned about who the person was. Then at the very end, there was a wall full of names and you got to see if the name they gave you survived or not. Even though I was a history major in college, I learned several new facts in this exhibit and it was extremely interactive and educational with fun mixed in! \\n\\nCurrently, they have an exhibit called \"Forces of Nature\" where you can learn about different weather patterns, climates and how weather happens. In the middle of the exhibit you can walk up onto a stage-like area where you experience different weather patterns interactively. I won\\'t give it away, but you could get stuck in some rainy weather! \\n\\nJust recently, I was giving a super secret sneak peak into the brand new exhibit launching on 9/27 called \"All About Me.\" They\\'ve been working on this exhibit for at least a year if not longer and it certainly shows! The amount of thought and energy they put into each e\\nxhibit is incredible and it\\'s an extremely dynamic experience. Throughout the exhibit, I \"x-rayed\" a body and learned about different body parts, I entered a stomach and discovered the ins and outs of the digestive system (no pun intended) and there was even an intestine slide to take a ride down. I placed my hands hands on a censored area and a drum beat to the rate of my heart! Needless to say, the exhibit excited me and while I definitely am still a kid at heart, it was the adult in me who couldn\\'t wait to come back and explore some more. \\n\\nBefore I go, I want to share some other favorites that the Science Center offers...the Imax and Adults Night Out! They have a state of the art, full size Imax theater on site and they show movies like Under the Sea. I am a big fan of the Imax and have been swept away into different worlds many times here. Adults Night Out is just that, where you can explore the exhibits, attend an Imax show and have a fun night out sans any children! I also heard\\n a rumor that they might be bringing alcohol back during these nights! Let\\'s wait and see. :)\\nBungalow how I love thee. This was one of the first restaurants I discovered in Phoenix when I first moved here and I\\'ve kept a close relationship ever sense. Bungalow gives you the impression that you\\'re eating on the waterfront of San Diego or Lake Tahoe. If you close your eyes and bypass the car noise, you\\'ll see what I\\'m talking about. As one of the best outdoor eateries in Old Town, there food is top notch bar and grill dining as well. Have you ever tried a fried avocado? It might sound scary but it\\'s anything but tasty. Bungalow offers an amazing HH special on drinks and appetizers but even during regular hours, the prices are reasonable. Day or night, hungry or thirsty, Bungalow is a great spot to relax with friends when the weather\\'s nice. \\n\\nMenu Suggestions:\\n\\nBurger or Sliders - YUM. \\nChicken Sandwich - Topped with fried avocados, you have to try it. \\nThe french fries are tasty\\nGive t\\nhe artichoke dip a chance. It comes with soft bread and melts in your mouth. \\nThe wraps are tasty as well. \\n\\nIf the weather is nice, be sure to secure an outdoor spot early or else you\\'ll be waiting awhile to experience the outdoor gem of Old Town.\\nHere\\'s what I want. I want a coffee shop where I can do my work in a peaceful and cozy setting without sitting on top of the person next to me and I\\'d love to have the option of a good sandwich if I happen to stay during lunch hour. I think I found that at Hob Nobs.  \\n\\nAfter driving by Hob Nobs too many times over the years, I finally made my way inside through the adorable patio surrounding a quaint historic house. The moment I stepped inside, it felt like I had stepped into a welcoming home. The warm wooden floors complimented the historic banisters and the house had the old feeling to it without smelling old. That\\'s a plus and sometimes hard to find in an old house. \\n\\nI looked around and saw plenty of seating options including several tab', 'actual_label': 47, 'predicted_label': 47}, {'text': 'les and chairs on the patio and several all throughout the house, including a converted sun room in the front. But personally, my favorite area was the living room with a worn in leather couch and two leather chairs looking at the fireplace still decorated with Christmas attire. \\n\\nThe staff warmly greeted me and I asked the lady what she normally likes. She pointed me in the direction of the Smokey Joe -- Gouda, turkey and tomato on white bread. I opted out of the Dijon and added in honey mustard and it was definitely a tasty treat! The bread was toasted and the turkey was warm and freshly roasted. The honey mustard with sweet and creamy all in one. It came with a pickle and small cup of fruit. The meal itself wasn\\'t on the cheap end ... more like middle of the road expensive...about $10 for a sandwich and drink. However, I think it\\'s definitely worth it if you are looking for a place to set up shop for awhile and this is definitely a cozy spot. Awhile later, I needed a caffeine boost \\nto get me through part two of the day, so I went the iced coffee route. They have a huge assortment of syrups and the coffee is freshly roasted and tasty. It was just $2 for a 16 oz cup of coffee which isn\\'t bad in my book! So, while the sandwiches might be a bit on the pricier end, the coffee is spot on reasonably priced. Plus on the sandwich end, the ingredients are so fresh, I\\'d rather pay a bit more for the oven turkey like I had. \\n\\nSo whether it\\'s warm or cool weather, Hob Nobs is an excellent option for a true coffee house experience...they even have life music some nights!\\nAnother Sam Fox hot spot but with so many reviews of Olive and Ivy, this review will mainly focus on the fabulous concept they created called...a marketplace. So it\\'s not the newest idea to hit the streets, but it\\'s a great bonus for Olive and Ivy to offer a marketplace for those on the go who are craving a Mediterranean chopped salad or one of their heavenly flat bread pizzas. \\n\\nI\\'ve been a frequenter of Oliv\\ne and Ivy since they first opened and like any other Sam Fox restaurant, they have a perfect blend of mainstream favorites with a twist based on the genre. The Sangria is delicious (I suggest the red), their salads are great and I love their flat bread pizzas. It\\'s perfect for a group dinner, a date, if you have friends visiting or if you just have an urge to sit along the canal (umm...I mean \"waterfront\") and enjoy the nice weather. \\n\\nWhile I love their food and I can always enjoy an extended lunch or dinner, sometimes I\\'m on the go and just want to be in and out. Rather than forcing me to call into the restaurant, order food to-go and wait for it by the hostess, the marketplace is Olive and Ivy\\'s go-to spot for to-go orders. Breakfast, lunch or dinner...if you\\'re hungry they\\'ve got something for you. I\\'ve had their egg sandwich which I\\'m thinking was a bit higher in calories than I wanted, but was worth it with every bite. I\\'ve been on the go and grabbed a salad, sandwich, coffee, de\\nssert, etc...etc...etc and the service is quick and seamless. They even have gelato if you\\'re sweet tooth is acting up. For solo lunch goers, the Olive and Ivy Marketplace is perfect because you can sit and eat without being in the actual restaurant. \\n\\nSo in summary, I love Olive and Ivy for the days that I can sit and stay but for the days I\\'m in a hurry, I know I can always count on their Marketplace.\\nWhen I worked on the west side, I would pass by a small Mexican import store every day on my way to work. I knew it was there from the random Mexican furniture displayed on the sidewalk. I never thought in a million years, I would ever actually step foot into that place, but then one day my boss at the time took me to lunch and yes, we ended up at Pepe\\'s. The Mexican furniture lined the sidewalk as I approached the restaurant, and I\\'m not sure if it\\'s attached to Pepe\\'s or just conveniently located next door, but it definitely adds to the authenticity of the restaurant. \\n\\nThis is truly \\na restaurant where you can\\'t judge it by its cover and questionable location on the outside. Once you step foot inside, it\\'s a fun and divey little Mexican food shop. Prices are extremely low and the food is good. The salsa has a nice kick to it and the food is pretty high in calories but also high in taste. \\n\\nI like Pepe\\'s for a decent west-side option for lunchtime. It\\'s a quick, tasty and cheap option for a sit-down restaurant. The Mexican decor on the walls adds to the experience and I could just as easily be in a little restaurant in Cabo instead of being in a restaurant on Camelback and 21st Ave. \\n\\nThis is definitely a spot worthy of checking out if you\\'re in the area during lunchtime and looking for a tasty lunch time treat.\\nStep foot inside Lenny\\'s and you\\'ll know what it feels like to live in 1950\\'s USA. This is an old-fashioned burger joint at its finest, serving nothing but good old fashioned burgers. Don\\'t ask for foie gras on your burger here. No here, you\\'ll get a juicy p', 'actual_label': 47, 'predicted_label': 47}, {'text': 'atty, mayo, onions, pickles and ketchup. Here you\\'ll eat every single calorie and never regret a single bite. That\\'s about all I can add to the reviews of Lenny\\'s, but if you want a delicious, juicy old-fashioned burger, visit Lenny\\'s.\\nI think shopping for clothes for baby-to-be has replaced shopping for me! I am full steam ahead in preparing for Baby to make her arrival in April and with that comes stocking the closet full of clothes...and boy can that get pricey! However, I was told that Carter\\'s has amazing sales and pretty decent prices so I stopped in for a visit. I was happy to catch them on a day where everything in the store was 50% so needless to say, I did some serious damage. \\n\\nI walked away with a closet full of clothes for the first several months of the baby\\'s arrival. The clothes are really cute here and they have a wide variety of styles to choose from. I especially appreciate their onesie department because they sell packs of three onesies so you\\'re getting some bang f\\nor your buck. I walked away with plenty of onesies, pants and of course dresses! Besides clothes, they also have socks, hats, mittens, bows, headbands and any other child accessories you need. \\n\\nI\\'m happy they have a stand alone store in the Valley and also appreciate that stores like Babies R Us sell their clothes as well!\\nPaper Place to the rescue! When planning my wedding, the 11th hour was quickly approaching and we needed to get ceremony programs created stat. I knew that the Paper Place could come to the rescue and they did! I worked with the entire staff and they were friendly, helpful and got the job done just in the nick of time! The programs turned out beautifully and they were the perfect addition to the wedding. Thank you Paper Place!\\nThis Target never lets me down and it especially didn\\'t let me down today. After hunting high and low for chocolate covered pretzel sticks I found them here and the Christmas elves are absolutely to thank for that.\\nConvenient? Yes. Home to the\\n vast majority of anything cotton you could ever need? Yes. Over priced? Yes. Worth it? On the right occasion. \\n\\nI pass by American Apparel on a daily basis and forget it\\'s there. But, then comes the time when I need a bright pink, green or yellow top and think...where should I go? Those are the times when American Apparel comes to the rescue...but I pay the price. It\\'s kind of like traveling to a rainy country without an umbrella and then it rains and you buy an umbrella at double the price. \\n\\nAmerican Apparel has pretty much any type of colorful cotton clothing you can imagine. From tights, to tanks, to dresses, to shorts, to leotards...you name it\\'s the Apparel\\'s got it. It\\'s a one stop shop for anything from costume needs to your daily colorful cotton needs. If my budget wouldn\\'t slap me on the hand, I\\'d shop there more. But, when I need something and can\\'t find it anywhere else, American Apparel normally has it. \\n\\nIf it was less expensive, I\\'d give it four stars, but since it\\'s on\\nly for the budget privileged, I give it a three.\\nArrogant Butcher is exactly what Downtown Phoenix has needed for awhile: a restaurant with a great atmosphere, yummy food, friendly staff and one that takes reservations! \\n\\nThis afternoon, I dined here for lunch and was pleased from the get-go. I arrived a little bit before my fellow lunchers, so I put our name in. It must have been perfect timing because about ten minutes later, the place had a line out the door. So for note one, I say to come at off hours, so for example, come at 11:50 instead of 12. \\n\\nThe atmosphere here is open, airy and fresh. I love the sidewalk patio and the windows so that even if you aren\\'t eating outside, you can still experience the fresh air and outdoor feel. The bar is seated in the middle and I noticed several local brews on tap. I also noticed several tasty drinks such as a skinny berry mojito. Since it was the middle of the day on a Tuesday, I didn\\'t get the chance to try it, but you better believe that I\\n will definitely be back! \\n\\nNow let\\'s move on to the food. Have you been to Culinary Dropout? If you answered yes, then you will be well familiar with this food. Sam Fox did an excellent job of mirroring the menu from his Scottsdale restaurant for the Arrogant Butcher. I saw that they have a similar Turkey Pastrami on the menu and I was told that the sweet potato tortellinis are to die for, more like dessert. Unfortunately, I personally didn\\'t try either, but I did have the Grilled Chicken Tabbouleh with avocado added. It came in a rather large bowl and I will admit that I ate every last bite it was so good. The dressing is an Oregano vinaigrette and the salad is graced with grilled chicken, cucumbers, tomatoes, feta, almonds and a couple other secret ingredients they didn\\'t list on the menu. \\n\\nAfter our \"ladies who lunch\" \\'esque meal, the staff happily validated our parking (making my parking free!) and sent us on our way. As we walked out the doors, we were met with the carpenters un', 'actual_label': 47, 'predicted_label': 47}, {'text': \"ion who decided that today was the day to protest, but that's what happens when you're in a real city right? And if that's the case, Downtown Phoenix...you are well on your way!\\n\\nThis seems like the perfect spot to eat at before a game, especially since they accept reservations and they are across the street from the stadiums! I did overhear the hostess say that there aren't many tables that seat more than six, so if you are coming with a large party, you should probably call ahead to ensure seating. \\n\\nBravo Sam Fox. Another job well-done.\\nIf you're a U of A or Michigan State fan, this is the bar to watch the game. Upper Deck is a decent sports bar in the heart of Old Town Scottsdale. Decent is the common word to describe Upper Deck. The food is decent, the drinks are decent, the prices are decent and the space is decent. On game day, the bar can get pretty crowded so its best to get there before the game you want to watch actually starts in order to secure a seat. The upstairs area ha\\ns another bar and additonal seating, including some red velvelt couches. On the ground floor, TVs line the walls and a theater TV is on the center wall. So, if your game is playing on that TV it's perfect. \\n\\nI typically only visit Upper Deck on a game day, but in that sense they've got their niche covered because on those, the place is packed. Be prepared to wait for your food and drinks due to the crowds but if you don't mind large crowds and decent (not always so quick) service, I suggest visiting to watch a game. And if possible, you might want to eat before. The food is decent, but it's worth checking out some other spots first and having a snack at Upper Deck.\\nI walk into Kate Spade and I'm immediately transformed to a time when tea time was mandatory and dinner was on the table at five pm sharp. Welcome to Kate Spade, a time warp straight into the 1950's. \\n\\nRecently, Kate Spade reopened its doors after a face lift (gasp, women didn't do face lifts in the '50's)! But, this lady wh\\no lunches did a great job resurfacing! The store is adorable. I could stay there for hours just browsing. They have clothes perfect for the stay at home wife and purses that make you look feminine even while hiking through the Grand Canyon. \\n\\nHere are some things I love about the Kate Spade store:\\n\\n- The decor. It's like a lady's perfect sitting room ready and waiting for afternoon company. \\n- The purses - for being a high-end purse, they are more afford-ably priced than others. \\n- The office supplies -- if you ever need anything for the office like a cute coffee mug, pencils, calendar, day planner, notepads, etc ... Kate Spade has adorable girly items and for a reasonable price too. \\n- They have phone covers for the iPhone G4! This is a rarity so get them while they are still in stock!\\nI'm adding one more update to my review. As I've mentioned before, the Mediterranean Chicken Salad is my favorite salad on the menu but while dining with my Mom I learned a helpful tip that makes the sa\\nlad even better. Yes it is possible to make it better! Instead of having the salad with the cold chicken, ask them to substitute it with the hot grilled chicken sliced on top. It changes the salad completely and makes it an even better meal!\\nIf anything could get me up in the morning, a shop like Scramble is it. I finally had the chance to try Scramble and it's apparent that I've definitely been missing out! \\n\\nOn your typical Saturday morning, breakfast joints can be overpopulated and require a 45 minute wait which normally dissuades me from visiting and causes me to just skip ahead to lunch instead. But this morning, I visited Scramble and I was pleasantly surprised when I saw that not only does Scramble have plenty of seating to accommodate the mass crowds, but it's an order, pay and seat your self style restaurant so it cuts out the dreaded wait time. Everything on the menu looks delicious, especially the brizza! I ended up opting for the veggie scramble with sun dried tomatoes, pep\\npers and cheese and accompanied with roasted potatoes. But the sourdough french toast sounded so delectable that my friends and I decided to split that as well. I'm glad we make the choice to go big or go home because the french toast was worth every bit! The service was relatively quick despite the crowded restaurant and the food was delicious and steaming hot upon arrival. \\n\\nWhile visiting, I noticed a sign announcing that Scramble is offering unlimited pancakes through the month of October. Sign me up for that! I also enjoyed the serve yourself unlimited coffee and soda fountain. It kept my thirst quenched while filling my belly with the tasty food. Like I mentioned, the restaurant offers plenty of seating and the atmosphere itself is clean and modern. But be prepared to sit in a less than comfortable seat. The restaurant would deserve an extra star if they had better seats and possibly more booths. But, like I said, the atmosphere was great and I like the fact that you can sit eith\", 'actual_label': 47, 'predicted_label': 47}, {'text': 'er inside or outside and enjoy the view of the desert mountains. \\n\\nI can\\'t wait to find my way to CenPho again soon so I can visit Scramble and try other items on the menu!\\nThis is my popcorn heaven! I\\'ve been reading about My Popcorn Kitchen for several months now and I finally had the chance to visit with my nephew. During an Aunt/nephew fun day, I wanted to take him someplace fun where we could fill up a bag with treats and I immediately thought of My Popcorn Kitchen. \\n\\nUpon walking in, I was greeted by a delicious smell of freshly baked popcorn being made in the back. The storefront itself was filled with specialty candy, popcorn and sodas. My nephew was in heaven, especially as we read the names of the sodas (things like...green monster snot, etc). It\\'s a kid\\'s dream. They had a small selection of novelty candy in bins to choose from. However, their specialty here is obviously the popcorn and it\\'s delicious! They have an overwhelming selection of flavors to choose from, both savor\\ny and sweet. I was very overwhelmed and just ordered the Chicago mix (cheddar and caramel combo), and then an individual caramel and cheddar for my nephew. \\n\\nWhat I especially enjoyed about My Popcorn Kitchen is the amount of tins they have to choose from. They have every sports team and college imaginable and the tins are large and perfect for popcorn. Once the popcorn is gone, the tins would be a great bin to be used in a game room or office. They also have specialty tins for teachers, birthdays, get well soon, etc. I should also mention that the popcorn pricing is incredibly reasonable. I will be using My Popcorn Kitchen for any special occasion coming up in the near future! I will also return to fulfill my own popcorn cravings as well.\\nI can now thank the Humane Society for not only giving me my dog Brutus when I was a child, but now my dog Harley as an adult. A couple of years ago, I planned a visit to the Arizona Humane Society to present them with a corporate donation on behalf \\nof my old company. When I scheduled the meeting, they offered to give me a tour of the vicinity and as a friend of the helpless animals, I said of course and planned my visit. However, I knew that with a tour, I might be in some trouble in the willpower department. \\n\\nWhen I arrived to the center, I was greeted by a pretty view of South Mountain and a wide open vicinity. I walked inside and immediately noted how clean it was for being home to many a furry creature. The staff was warm and welcoming as potential new \"parents\" waited in the lobby to adopt a new friend. Kittens and bunnies greeted the guests and there was a special area for the cats being featured that week. The vicinity was a five star facility to say the least and I could immediately tell that the animals were treated well here and in good hands until they found a new home. \\n\\nTo make a long story shorter, they gave us a detailed tour of the complex. I walked through spacious room after spacious room full of dogs of all ki\\nnds just wanting a home. As I walked up to one of the cages, a furry ball of fluff looked up at me and placed his paw on the cage. I fell in love immediately. To make matters worse, the staff then took us into a room where we could make a kong of peanut butter and treats for our dog of choice. Of course I had to give it to my new found friend. At that point I knew I was in trouble and could very well be leaving with a dog. So to end that part of my story, I did leave with a dog and Harley has been happy in his new home ever sense. \\n\\nWhile I visited the Humane Society, I couldn\\'t get over their quality of service for not only the clients but the animals themselves. They were clean, kept in spacious areas and they even had a huge playground for the animals to play in each and every day. When i found Harley and started to think about taking him home with me, they took me to a private play area where I could get to know Harley a bit more to make sure he was the right dog for me. A staffer \\nstayed in the area and helped me with any questions I had. When I made the decision to take Harley home with me, they neutered him, gave me a couple free vet visits and sent me home with some treats, food and a leash. They even have a pet store to pick up all your essentials for your new friend. And did I mention that the proceeds go back to the Humane Society...a nonprofit? \\n\\nThis Arizona Humane Society is a five star pet resort that focuses on making the most of a pet\\'s stay until they find a new home. I suggest just taking a visit to the facility to see how well-kept it is. They even have horses that they rescued. Sorry folks, they are not up for adoption though. So thank you Arizona Humane Society for bringing my little dog Harley to me and saving so many animals from the streets.\\nNordstrom gets four stars because at least we have one! I remember the days when Arizona didn\\'t have a Nordy\\'s and let me tell you, those were some sad days. So for that I am grateful that Nordy\\'s is here', 'actual_label': 47, 'predicted_label': 9}, {'text': ' and close to where I live. This isn\\'t the biggest or the coolest Nordstrom out there, but at the same time, Scottsdale can\\'t really compare to an SF, NYC or Chicago which is why the Nordstrom here is the way it is. It has everything you need - great shoes, makeup, purses and clothes, but at a smaller scale then some of the larger metro ones. I love their purse department and especially since they added the high-end purses. Yes, it is more of a window shopping delicacy for me, but I still love it. The cafe is also delicious and a perfect place for a light bite after or during shopping.\\nThank you, thank you, thank you for bringing such a charming restaurant to Old Town! I am giving The House a solid five stars and it\\'s because they have the perfect ambiance and delicious food to accompany it. The ambiance is what really sets this restaurant apart from any other restaurant in Old Town. \\n\\nWhen I go out out to eat, I like to experience the complete package: experience + delicious cuisine. \\nMany times, restaurants focus so much on their culinary creations that they forget about working on the environment. This is not the case for The House. The House is \\'housed\\' within the second oldest house in Scottsdale. During my visit, I learned about the delightful woman who grew up in the house and how she loved her rose bushes. She was a member of one of the first families in Scottsdale and during one of the wars, she would deliver fallen soldier notices and then lend a helping hand to the families while they went through their time of loss. The history alone of this house defines the charm.\\n\\nHidden in a quiet street that\\'s often missed (luckily) by the bar/club scene, The House is like a place you wish you could call home. Twinkle lights light up the spacious patio and large and luscious trees surround the perimeter. The interior of the house is just as charming as the exterior. At night, the intimate indoor glows with romantic candlelight while the warmth from the wood fired ove\\nn heats up the environment. It\\'s the perfect environment for a date night or if you\\'re looking for a nice setting for out of town guests, etc. \\n\\nNow that I\\'ve gushed about the environment, I will move on to the food. The food here is nothing less than spectacular, but I am not surprised because this is Matt Carter\\'s brain child and he also runs The Mission down the street. I came here with a group of 15 and they did an excellent job serving us a variety of delicious food. The menu allowed us to sample the following:\\n\\nWood Grilled Crab Legs with Aji Amarillo Lime Butter - this is buttery goodness at it\\'s best. The crab is fresh, completely buttered and delicious. \\n\\nHouse Brisket & Biscuit - this is a nice option for a hearty appetizer. The brisket is tender and well seasoned. \\n\\nPeel and Eat Shrimp - spicy alert! This dish as a serious kick and if you can handle the spice, this is definitely worth ordering. \\n\\nKale Sale with Miso Peppercorn Dressing - I\\'m not a huge fan of kale, but I wil\\nl say that for kale, they did a good job flavoring it and making it eatable for even the non-kale eaters. \\n\\nItalian Farro Salad \\nDuck Confit Meatballs - I had no idea I was eating duck! However, it\\'s tasty and just the right size to pop in your mouth. \\n\\nBerkshire Pork Country Ribs - the meat falls off the bones out of tenderness and it\\'s seasoned with a spice that has a kick. \\n\\nChateau Briand, Marinated Jidori Chicken, Lobster Friend Rice , Broccoli Carbonarra -- all these dishes were good. None of them stood out in my mind, but they were still incredibly tasty. \\n\\nCaramel Apple Upside Down Cake & Crumb Cake & Sacher Torte - pure sugary bliss!! \\n\\nI\\'ve already written a lengthy review, but before I say goodbye, I will also mention their hand crafted cocktails. They are superb! The drinks are made with freshly squeezed fruit, etc. They are a must if you enjoy craft cocktails!\\nMouthwatering cuisine really can come in a small package and Il Bosco is here to prove that size definitely does n\\not matter! I met the lovely Anna M for lunch recently and much to my delight, she introduced me to Il Bosco. \\n\\nHidden down an alley on the north west corner of Shea and Scottsdale Road, Il Bosco is a humble abode filled with a whole lot of flavor. The restaurant itself is tiny and probably only hold around 50-60 people. Upon walking in, I was immediately greeted by the scent of pizza baking in the wood fired oven and a feeling of hominess with dark wood and brick paneling and close seating. You know those restaurants where they offer you an \"eating in the kitchen\" experience and make you make a reservation months in advance for the chance to \"dine with the chef\" Well here, you get to do so every time you visit because the open kitchen is just steps away from the seating. Therefore you get to see the pizza being created from scratch and here\\'s the best part of the entire experience...the pizza cooks in 90 seconds! Yes 90 seconds! \\n\\nI ordered the Biaggia which comes with prosciutto, figs', 'actual_label': 47, 'predicted_label': 47}, {'text': ', four cheeses, arugala and evo. The lunch pizzas are personal pizzas so Anna ordered the Lucia which comes with cheese, tomato sauce, sausage and mushrooms. I could smell the pizza being made and I started to drool with anticipation. Finally a whole 90 seconds later, poof! The pizza appeared and I took my first heavenly bite which turned into many more heavenly bites. This pizza is some of the best pizza I\\'ve ever had and I have had my fair share of pizza! The crust is a combination of crunchy and chewy and it\\'s seasoned to perfection. The toppings are a perfect combination of sweet and savory and compliment the crust perfectly. I must say that the Biaggia was by far the most superb pizza I\\'ve had in quite some time. The Lucia was also extremely good but the Biaggia stole poor Lucia\\'s thunder. It was a delicious lunch and I really enjoyed the atmosphere. It\\'s one of the best kept secrets around but I don\\'t think it should be a secret. Everyone should experience this pizza! \\n\\nI will le\\nave you with one more little fun fact. They have a portable wood fired oven that they use for catering! It\\'s amazing and would be great for a party. I also noticed that they have a walk-up window where you can order take-out.\\nTrue to Downtown Phoenix, The Main Ingredient Ale House and Cafe is in the most unassuming area and you have to have an eagle eye while driving to find it.\\n\\nOnce I entered the house situated in the historic downtown neighborhood, I noticed the homey vibe of this converted house. The patio was lit with luminous lights and guests were enjoying a casual and cozy dining experience. While the patio was lively, the inside (although cozy), was pretty empty so we opted for the outdoor option -- especially since the weather was so nice that night.\\n\\nBesides the atmosphere, the food at Main Ingredient is comfort food with a twist. I ordered a warm turkey \"jive\" sandwich which was on crunchy sourdough bread, with freshly slices of warm turkey and topped with jalapeno cream ch\\neese. The sandwich was large, in charge and accompanied by a hefty field green salad. It was too big for me to finish more than half, but if ordered, this could be a good leftover meal. I also tried the mac and cheese with a kick of green chilies. It\\'s listed as an appetizer but so hearty it can absolutely suffice for a meal. The artichoke heaven as a starter was hearty as well and you could easily share that with three or four others due to how rich it is. The beers to wash down the meal were tasty and they had some unique options to choose from. \\n\\nSo for a house-converted restaurant in Downtown Phoenix, it\\'s worth trying out if you\\'re in the area and once you leave the hustle of 7th street and sit at the Ale House, you\\'ll forget that you are just off a busy city street.\\nIt\\'s been years since I\\'ve been to Grazie, but I was pleasantly surprised that this place is still hopping! \\n\\nThe service can be slow at times, but it\\'s a great spot for a leisurely date night or dinner with friends. \\nI absolutely love the twinkle lights romantically lighting the courtyard and the cozy and quaint vibe inside. The brick oven keeps the restaurant warm and smelling delicious. The customers are typically vibrant which makes this a lively spot but in a way that allows you to carry on a conversation without your neighbors listening in. For the food, I enjoy one of the bruschettas or bread dishes to start and for pizza, I love the Toscana which is mushroom and sausage. The pizza is thin crust and delicious. This is by far one of my favorite pizza spots and date night destinations in Old Town.\\nCosmic bowling after 10? Yes. Bowling shoes, two hours of bowling and a pizza for $14.99? Yes. An arcade that includes an air hockey table? Yes. A full bar with buckets of beer (mix and match) for decent pricing? Yes. So is this a perfect weekend night activity? Absolutely! \\n\\nThe Valley doesn\\'t have many bowling alleys which I find odd, but the ones they have vary. This bowling alley is a good one bec\\nause it\\'s a little off the beaten path which means you can actually call and reserve a lane at 6:00 PM on a Saturday night for 7:45 PM. The bowling alley is full of hs students, couples and families. It\\'s not shady here and they keep it clean and up-to-date.\\nThis should be called a speakeasy coffee shop. Why? Because you really have to be told about it to really know it\\'s there! The shop has minimal signage on the exterior and it\\'s housed within a urban multi-use warehouse on Roosevelt with different vendors and an art space. I can only imagine how cool this building must be to visit during First Fridays! Once inside, I was pretty surprised that the coffee shop is more spacious than I would have figured. It\\'s pretty sparse inside, but there were plenty of seats to do some work or have a meeting. \\n\\nThe coffee here is strong and delicious. After drinking my non-fat iced latte, I had to refrain myself from bouncing off the walls! It\\'s definitely coffee with a kick if you need a wake-up ca', 'actual_label': 47, 'predicted_label': 47}, {'text': \"te seems to have that option but it has never once worked for moi) The high shipping prices have pretty much ruled out the online option for me so its good to see another store when I can't find something in the Downtown store.\\nI would say worth a visit if you like this color scheme and their style of clothing.\\nThis update is needed for the new upgraded store. Gone is the old style corner store feel. The new setup is bright and airy and they have added a much needed variety. There is even a validated 1 hour parking so its just right for a quick grab and go. I liked the meat selection at this location as the dedicated butcher counter was greatly needed. The size of this store has gone up a bit as well. While its not in the same league as the nearby two flagship stores for other brands it will do just fine for most people as a grocery store. Good update Sobeys keep it up.\\nNow they are selling beer and wine this location too. A good option if you want to grab something quick while grocery\\n shopping.\\nThis is fairly big grocery store located conveniently at the intersection of highway 7 and Woodbine.\\nInitially it seems Italian oriented but if one has explored it enough one realizes it has more to offer. It does get a lot of competition from other bigger stores with vicinity but I feel this a good place to grab a lunch. \\nIn terms of other items this place is no slouch and carries some hard to find Italian items (You can find the Lavazza il perfectto espresso here which has been hard to locate in Toronto for me) \\nTheir coffee bar is actually decent and they offer a good iteration of a cappuccino. Be on the look out for the drink and dessert promo for a measly 4.19$ You get to pick a premium drink and a dessert for under 5$ and the icing on the cake is they have loyalty card to boot! Needless to say this became my go to spot for the caffeine fix I require everyday while working when I was in this area.\\n3.5 Stars overall.\\nFor those of us who are not handy enough comes a dread\\ned time when something in the place you call home breaks down. Its a toss up whether to brave the repair yourself or bite the bullet and pay the exorbitant charges to have something done by a professional. \\nI had a leaky faucet that I tried to fix after watching numerous youtube videos and reading articles. I was confident I would be able to do this as I had changed a faucet before but this one was impossible. The space was very limited and I couldn't fit underneath the sink to dislodge the faucet. So after a quite a few tries I finally took the plunge and starting calling various places to get a quote to have a faucet changed. The prices vary a lot in a the city most of the people won't give you a fix quote and many say they need to see the job before committing. Surprisingly yelp didn't help much as there were a few places reviewed here. \\nNevertheless after trying for a few days with various other business I got a quick response by email from Mike the plumber 4 u and I called in and \\ngot a fix quote. It was reasonable compared to others so I went for it. Booking was breeze and I was given a half hour window for the plumber to show up. The plumber arrived on time and immediately started working (a good sign if you ask me as I have seen people just roam around and waste time if they charge by the hour)\\nHowever he couldn't dislodge the faucet too and had to take out the whole sink. Before proceeding I was given a fix quote for this additional work as well so I knew how much I would end up paying. An hour and half later I had new clean running faucet. Kudos to the plumber for cleaning up afterwards. All in all high recommendations for your plumbing needs.\\nBoy what a relief this store is. The beer store close to where I live stopped carrying some of the Unibrue stuff that I cherish and I had to shlep my way across to some not very nice neighborhoods to get the object of my desire (la fin du monde, maudite) \\nThe location is one of the best for the beer store I have seen \\nfor people without cars, right next to the entrance/ exit from the Dundas station so one can just hop in and out for a quick purchase.\\nAlso of note is this is not a recycle location (read it doesn't stink like many other Beer Stores that recycle are known for).\\nThe beer selection is decent and covers all sort of beer styles.\\nThe place is new so has that clean, inviting feel that other Beer stores lack.\\nStaff is friendly and helpful as well. \\nThe place needs some issues to be ironed out as my Amex wouldn't go through somehow. \\nOne of the better beer stores in my book.\\nWe have a decent alternate to the food courts here folks. The noodles are made fresh by hand and one has an option to choose the size of the noodles to boot. The place was packed when I visited. I opted for the takeout option on this visit. They package the items well with the broth and dry items separately. They also provided a pack of hot chillies which provided the kick I felt the beef broth warranted. The noodles are g\", 'actual_label': 48, 'predicted_label': 48}, {'text': \"ood and beef was OK as well. I think this place would be a great spot to cure the winter blues. \\nI think I will try the sides in next time as well.\\nSolid place for if you want to get your noodle fix.\\nThe Name has changed but thankfully the quality has not. \\nStill one of the top spots for Cappuccino in the city so its no wonder this is my first spot on the Indie Coffee Passport for 2012\\nHere is the verdict\\nEspresso: Medium/strong flavor\\nCrema': Just gorgeous \\nMilk: Frothed very well with nice microfoam though didn't have the sweet finish one craves.\\nLatte Art: Better than the last visit\\nOnly knock against is milk frothing as otherwise the drink would be perfect.

However we got a good rate and a 2 bedroom was necessity which rules out using hotwire (not guaranteed)/\\nThe hotel was booked solid and I was offered a free breakfast if I took a smoking room(bleh). The room was on the 4th floor and the walkaway had a clear cigarette smell so I wasn't sure I got right room (I found out later that the floor above had smoking rooms hence the smoke smell leaks on the floor below).\\nThe room was minuscule and the old style furniture it was completely overwhelmed and there was barely any room to walk around let alone put stuff.  \\nThe washroom didn't fare better  as the layout is very poor and the shower took forever to drain. One of the friend's got upgraded to a suite since they have the Platinum status on the Fairmont Club. For a suite I think the room was unde\\nrwhelming as well. \\nThe location is quite good as its few min from the main drag and is located on the transport hub. \\nWill I stay here again hmm not likely.\\nThis CT is what I expect from CT's. Covers a wide range of items (some kitchen items when on clearance are very tempting). Customer service is almost non existent. \\nOnce I needed to buy something and I checked online and that item was in stock here. It took me a long time to flag someone to help me out and they checked their inventory system to find they had 6 in stock. But guess what the sales person said oh our system is never up to date even if the online and inventory system says we have it in stock we are sold out.   \\nBasically they have no idea where things are. \\nNot the one to give up easily I started to check the aisles where I thought this item would be and guess what I found it. Lucky for me I trust the system more than the sales person/ I reported this episode to the service desk but I doubt they will do anything. I gue\\nss they have a captive market so don't really care if people are unsatisfied IMO.\\nSo my suggestion is if you go there know what you are looking for and where to look for it as other than that you are pretty much on your own\\n4 Star for variety of items sold here\\n1 star for service (is there something like 0 stars)\\nBoy the food quality has gone down here. This is the 3rd visit where the food was of poor quality so I feel an update is warranted. The beer selection is still great though they have competition now so sitting on their laurels won't do them any good as the food quality has to be brought up.  Things started a bit shaky as somehow we ended up ordering the the Syrah and it was off (teaches us to order wine for place synonymous with beer)\\nOn to the food we ordered the following\\nBeer Burger: Devoid of seasoning and the necessary fat IMO. The bun didn't do it any good either as it had an odd finish to it.\\nThe salmon which came with couscous was so oily that plate looked it was ladle\\nd with oil. \\nThe chicken curry was strange attempt at regional cuisine as the meat still had skin on it. Needless to say we won't be back here for food for sure.\\n2.5 stars mainly due to the beer selection.\\nThis location doesn't carry cigars which was the main reason for my visit. Nevertheless nice cozy setup. Plenty of accessories, includes wide selection of pens, office accessories etc. \\nGood selection of brand named items if you are into that kind of stuff. The sales person was polite and patiently showed me a variety of items I was interested in.\\nPart of the Indie Coffee passport this place is in the west end of the city. \\nThe Setup is nice but somehow there is a weird echoing whistle like sound that was annoying during my visit here. The aroma of beans being roasted was intoxicating though.\\nNow for the drink there I ordered a cappuccino. There is no latte art as milk was just frothed and dolloped over the espresso shot. \\nThe espresso was extremely hot. I had to wait quite a bit bef\", 'actual_label': 48, 'predicted_label': 48}, {'text': \"ore I could sip my cappuccino as I couldn't make much of it initially. The espresso was weak  and mellowed out quite a bit with milk.\\n1.5 star for the cappuccino with the setup being 4 stars.\\nOn my second trip I had the machiato sadly it was extremely bitter. I can't understand why they can't pull a decent shot as they seem to have a good setup for it i.e. own roasters and micro batches. I guess one should stick to their drop type coffee as espresso drinks are sub par.\\nI will give this place props for aiming high (one should always aim for the peak so even if you are half way you are way above most of the other people)  as far as the names is concerned. I mean if you want to be the best why limit yourself to city, province or a country! \\nI am not an olive connoisseur by any means but I can tell a good one from a bad one. This place was intriguing as it is right next to my go to place Turkish groceries (including olives). Turkey a name synonymous with good olives I was expecting a good \\nvariety here and they didn't disappoint.  They even had the one's that are marinated in citrus/lemon, a delicacy that I tried at a friend's house.\\nI wanted to try a variety of stuff but unfortunately they don't sell something less than 100 grams (or at least that's what I was told). They had a medley of sorts in a lightly spiced oil (some pepper flakes) so I decided to get those. Quite decent IMO some were stuffed , some just pitted and then there was an unexpected one or two that was just a whole olive with the pit and all.\\nThe place is clean and seems well maintained and I would like to explore it a bit more. I think I will come here with a friend who is a olive connoisseur and can perhaps guide me in selecting a few varieties to take home.\\nAnother addition to the Instagram worthy pic spot trend that seems to be the rage in the city. I have tried made to order ice cream with liquid nitrogen in the past so the gimmick didn't have that effect on moi. IMO quality ingredients are key to \\na good ice cream which are missing in this spot. The setup is OK at the entrance with a bit of chaos when it come to ordering. There isn't much of a flow to the lineup as I had to ask which line was for pickup and which one was for ordering. \\nI ended up trying the Baileys version on this visit as salted caramel wasn't available. The serving is minuscule and at this price point it better be darn good. Nope not here folks. \\n2 stars considering the price point.\\nWe came here for a birthday celebration after loading up on good pizza spot upstairs. The place was somewhat packed and has a laid back cool vibe. We got lucky as a group of people were leaving and we were able to snag a larger table.\\nThis place's claim to fame is the Rakia (a popular alcoholic beverage in Southeast Europe produced by distillation of fermented fruit according to WiKi) I haven't had this liquor before but have tried similar stuff from Turkey and Lebanon.  It is best enjoyed with some food from what I was told unfort\\nunately we were all so full that couldn't order food and just stuck to drinks. Beer selection is OK and wine list seemed decent. The prices are quite reasonable so one can go overboard. I tried the pear and plum flavored rakia (not my cup of tea) but if you like that sort of alcohol I would say give it a shot (pun intended) \\nThen they started playing LIVE traditional style music. Needless to say the party was elevated to a whole another level with the birthday girl sashaying all over, and several of us joining in the action, fun times. The service was good and we did enjoy the cozy vibe this place offers. We ended up closing the bar as this outing lasted till the wee hours of the morning always a good sign. \\nA nice place to visit if you are hell bent on painting the town red.\\nThis review applies to the take out dessert I have tried so far. First off its a welcome relief for the people who have access to the PATH network. There is a dearth of decent dessert spots so this one is a welcom\\ne relief. The setup is nice and if their desserts a precursor I will be here for brunch.\\nOn the couple of take outs I tried the Pistachio pound cake which was just right. Nice moist and healthy dose of pistachio (was luved by all the guests) Orange was OK. The benchmark for moi croissant was decent as well.\\nUnfortunately the cappuccino was forgetful. \\nA good addition to the PATH I will revisit for brunch and update.\\nAfter having a set a high bar for grilled items at their sister concern next door I was looking forward to this spot. We were running a bit late so I was kinda starving when I arrived. The place was packed and they gave us a corner seat as that was the only table left. \\nAfter going through the menu we ordered the following\\nmaast-o khiar for app, morasa polo and fesenjaan with chicken as mains. The menu is focused mainly on rice dishes from what I could tell. \\nThe app arrived and looked appetizing with a bit of color which is kinda the signature for this cuisine. The yogurt \", 'actual_label': 48, 'predicted_label': 48}, {'text': \"was very light the raisins and walnuts added a nice taste texture to this simple dish.\\nNow for the main they did come with a side of salads which was very bland. The shank though tender was bit cold and was a small portion. Rice was very good. The chicken dish was poor with very little chicken and it seemed like it was later added to the dish and not cooked together. The rice on the side was again quite good but didn't save this dish.\\nThey do even have the seating where one can feel like getting the royal treatment on the Takht (Daybed) so if you enjoy that kind of thing by all means give it a try and call ahead for a reservation. Personally I would rather go to their spot next door sans the Takht.\\nThe cafe called cashew & clive is forgetful and I would say stay away from it. The cappuccino I ordered was weak and fellow diners drinks/desserts were poor. \\nEven the drip coffee was poor.   \\nThe muffins could have been from a generic store in addition the prices were surprising with a sala\\nd costing in the teens. The wine selection was bleh as well so I wouldn't  recommend trying those as well\\nService was not good as well but I guess one doesn't come here for food or drinks but I guess they can still use an improvement. The only good thing is an outdoor seating area where one can enjoy the sun and relax.\\nHere is the verdict for the capp\\nHere is the verdict for the cappuccino\\nEspresso: Mild\\nCrema': below average \\nMilk: very poorly frothed\\nLatte Art: Non existent\\nI can safely say a fully automatic machine can do a better job than the drink that was served.\\nI came here for as part of Indie Coffee Passport 2012 (ICP). Having tried it last year and not being satisfied with their cappuccino I decided to try something else. Their claim to fame is their small batch roasting operation. This trip they didn't have running and thanks to that the whistling noise was absent that I encountered last year. Though it didn't matter as on a nice sunny day like today I decided to take on of \\nthe two seats outside and ordered an Americano.\\n\\nEspresso: Strong\\nCrema': decent\\nMilk: NA\\nLatte Art: NA\\nThe Americano fared much better than the cappuccino as it did pack the wallop needed for this drink.Quite a decent version of this drink\\n3 Stars.\\nWell for starters I am not a big fan of the Beatles (Yes we do exist) so I was not really looking forward to this. We had reasonable seats and the venue is quite large and with stage being 360 and they way main stage is set it is possible to miss out somethings. Cirque tried to cover it with something going on each side but I found it to be a sensory overload. The soundtrack is good as it is a take on legendary music here. The acrobats are ok but not amazing like other shows. My friend enjoyed it but I wasn't impressed so my take is if you are a Beatles fan by all means go for it but if you are Cirque fan there are much better options.\\nThis cigar shop is on the north edge of Toronto. From the front it doesn't seem like much till you walk in\\n and find out the place is quite big.\\nHuge walk in humidor with all the Cuban Cigars well represented. In addition an extensive range of non Cuban cigars. Its a good spot to find hard to locate non cuban cigars. \\nThey also carry a good range of accessories such as belts pens etc in addition to smoking related products. \\nThe sales person was helpful and spent enough time with me explaining things. The prices are in line with most of the downtown stores.\\nI came here for a UYE and a lot of food was comped so its not really fair to judge those items so here goes.   \\nThe sashimi platter was decent so kudos for that, nice presentation and the shrimp heads very an interesting item on the plate . The Spicy Salmon with nacho chips was and odd combo.\\nI ordered some items on my own, Tako Wasabi (one of my go to items at a local Izakaya) This one didn't come with nori, no problems there all I had to do was ask and I was given a generous amount of nori to wrap it up. Full marks for service here. Ta\\nste was OK with lots of octopus chunks though wasabi root was missing and daikon as an unnecessary ingredient. \\nAlso of note was the 1$ for 3 piece of Salmon Sashimi on weekdays (how can I not order that) sashimi was again decent and at that price a no brainer. \\nThey have good drink list and all major Japanese beer are well represented. I am not a Soju drinker but they list here is sure to satisfy the people who crave it. Also the list of sake is good.\\nThe setup is modern and the sound plays K-Pop which can be quite entertaining if you watch the videos as well :) \\nA decent place to kill the night in this area. 3.5 stars\\nThis store is quite an improvement over the Yonge street location which still doesn't mean much as we are talking about a business in decay. My experience with Staples has been mostly meh as if you are looking for a promo item its mostly out of stock. There is dearth of staff when you walk around in the store.\\nOne can get lucky and find some stuff at good prices at this\", 'actual_label': 48, 'predicted_label': 48}, {'text': \" chain otherwise its just your run of a mill stuff. \\nThis store is bigger and cleaner than the other branch nearby and has parking so if that is something that attracts you by all means give it a try.\\nI had no reference point to this store as I had neither seen nor heard of it before. Someone pointed out they are owned by Urban Outfitters which didn't help much either as I don't know much about that store either other than that I have seen their sign here and there.\\nWalking in it felt like a modern countess villa. I mean flowers print galore from head to toe, kitchen to sink..... you get the idea\\nThe space is huge but the layout is odd to say the least, just a mish mash of things here and there\\nMusic is unexpected on the visit there as it didn't go with the ambiance they are going for here.  Its difficult for me to rate this store as either you like this design/feel or don't. Expect to spend some $$$ and go home feeling hollow or fulfilled (there isn't much in between for this store)\\nF\\nolks we have winner on our hand here. I am quite partial to good danish (pastry that is) and this one hits all the marks that appeal to moi. \\nButtery goodness check\\nflaky dough check \\nnot too sweet check\\nI just luved the crowns, The cinamon rolls were surprisingly good as well. \\nWith them moving soon to my neighborhood (union station) this will wreak havoc on my dessert intake. \\n4 solid stars\\nI will be back!\\nA colleague from out of town who is a beer aficionado was in town so we decided to try this place after reading the reviews as I am not a fan of Bier Markt.\\nWe decided to do a walk in at around 6 on a Saturday (a bad idea as they were apparently full) We decided to wait anyway and were seated after half an hour.  We went for the beer flights (I recommended my colleague stick to UniBroue (he had Chambly, Maudite and another brew) I wish they had La Fin Du Monde as that's my favourite beer in Canada. We ordered 3 appetizers (Buffalo wings, Steak Tartare, Fries) and Duck Confit Pizza.\\n The fries were great wings were ho hum and steak tartar and Duck Confit Pizza average. \\nGreat Selection of beer so 5 Star for that \\n3 Star for food \\nSo average is 4 star  \\n(pricey for a bistro but worth it)\\nMy review is for a quick meal here so will update if and when I visit them for a proper meal.\\nMy friends are a fan of their other location but usually tend to not eat in there as apparently that spot is a lot smaller. They were looking forward when they heard a new branch is being opened.\\nI had no reference point for this area as hardly ever venture out here. I had been in this plaza for a Hakka food place nearby so kinda recognized the space.\\nWe came here at an odd time for lunch so pretty much had the place to ourselves. The service was very personal as the servers recognized my friend as being a repeat customer at the other spot. \\nMenu is your mainly focused on grilled items. I tend to order items that are hard to replicate at home and though I wasn't that hungry I decided to go\\n with a Bihari Kebab roll (I chose pratha instead of naan for the roll)\\nMy friend went for the Malai Tikka. \\nThe service was prompt and we didn't have wait much. The roll that I ordered was quite authentic as it was spiced well (I luv when ethnic places don't hold the spice back to cater to a Western tastes) Nice tender meat grilled just right for this dish. \\nI didn't try my friends dish but if this is a taste of things to come I will come back for a full fledged meal.\\n3.5 Stars\\nThis is one of the bigger Canadian Tires (CT) accessible by car downtown. The location, variety and service is head and shoulders above the Dundas Square location. \\nThe building it is located in houses a Starbucks and Mark Warehouse (kinda a signature thing for CT) \\nThe place is bright and has lots of space. \\nStaff was helpful in the few instances I needed them.  I have not used their home improvement staff much though as I guess that's the area someone like me needs the most help. \\nI don't come here often enou\\ngh to know whether the on special items are well stocked but I did see plenty of bins full of the items advertised in their flyer on my last visit here.\\nI by no means adhere to the rule if its not at Canadian Tire its not worth buying! (yes I have heard this one a few times in Canada) but if I have a choice to go to a CT near downtown this one would be it.\\nThis place has an interesting distinction of being the only purveyor of organic halal meat in Canada from what I have been told. My friend's family only eat halal meat and want it to be organic which is quite hard apparently so they were the one's who found it. Will make it easier for me to entertain them in the future as this place hits both marks. \\nNice clean space with neatly laid out items. The variety of red meat isn't that much from what I saw and the marbling on the steak was mediocre. They do have grass fed version as well so I guess I can hold judgement till I have tried the steaks. \\nOtherwise plenty of options for chicken i\", 'actual_label': 48, 'predicted_label': 48}, {'text': \".e ground (white and dark) packaged skinless and boneless and one can order in advance apparently to get the meat butchered to one's liking. \\nI also enjoyed browsing the other organic items and though wasn't looking for anything in particular found some items that peaked my curiosity. Prices were in line with other organic meats. The best part for me that even though it was Sunday the place wasn't a mad house like other spots. \\nI will be back for sure and will update after I have tried the all important steaks.\\nI am a sucker for good freshly baked products. \\nAfter being amazed by Pizza Pide in its hay days I was looking for another go to spot after the quality at my old fav went down a bit.\\nSadly this place isn't much better and has neutralized the taste to cater to main stream tastes. That isn't saying its bad by any means. It beats most of the pizza joints hands down.\\nMy buddy and I ordered two mix Pide (#18) and one lahmahchun ( #1 which isground beef on a lavash type bread)\\nThe dou\\ngh was top notch so full marks for that I think its a tad bit better than their competition. As for the spicing on the meats it was ho hum. Sujjuck was kinda bland. There wasn't any bastarma on the mix pizza. The meat on Lahmahchun was thicker than its is supposed to be and spicing was lacking as well.  I can't complain much since this place is a lot more accessible than their counterpart and with the price you pay you can't go wrong. I will come back here when I want my Pide fix.\\nA solid 3.5 stars.\\nThis cigar shop is conveniently accessible by PATH. The walk in humidor is not huge but they do have very good selection of Cuban Cigars. They do carry some premium non Cuban cigars. The service is very good and the sales person spent time with me and gave recommendations based on what I like. \\nThe do carry a whole lot of other smoking related items and accessories. In addition luxury accessories.\\nThe prices are in line with most of the other Cigar shops in this area.\\nA good 3.5 stars.\\nA ni\\nce addition to this mall. Had I known before hand I would have saved my dessert appetite for this gem. I am a big fan of this place and am partial to their Danish. If you are one the edge try out their crown and you will become a fan. I have yet to try their breads so tried a sample. Hmm not sold yet so will try another time\\nNow this train station should get 4 stars for the ease of access and direct connection to several hotels, subway trains and a food court that will put a lot of so called gourmet food courts to shame in other cities. I didn't get to admire the architecture as my exposure to this spot has been limited to just walking across to take the subway or waiting in line as I left the room merely 15 min before boarding.\\nFrom what I saw they had Premier Maisson (one of the better bakery I have been to North America) , some other quick grab and go spot and a Staples. \\nThe directions can be a bit confusing at first but I have got my bearings down for Montreal so after a bit of re\\nading around it wasn't hard to navigate this place.\\nFor a short weekend trip I think the this option is very viable provided one plans ahead.\\nThe initial reviews were great for this place so I was really looking forward to my visit here. Made the reservation online and showed up a little bit early. I normally don;t go to this area of town so it was a pleasant surprise to see an eclectic mix of dining options here. There were supposed to be 4 of us but one from the group couldn't make it. I ordered the Delirium Tremens one of my go to beer  when on draft, partners in crime ordered La Fin Du Monde and and interesting take on a sprtizer (I forgot what it is called it was mixture of prosecco, soda and lemonade with some black berries) \\nWe decided to to order one appetizer of sweet breads, I ordered the Lobster pot pie, others had Steak Frites and Lobster Cob Salad. Now the wait began the service in dining area was good and our water was topped up regularly but we waited a good half and hou\\nr or so for the appetizer. The sweet breads were fried and drenched in buffalo sauce. The Batter was thick and then sauce completely over powered this delicacy. One could not even taste the sweet breads, a very surprising dish for a french place and not in a good way. Well now the wait for  mains began and it went on for a while the place was packed for a Monday but this kind of wait is bordering on unacceptable.\\nFinally the mains arrived the lobster pot pie was like a soup the pastry crust though moist wasn't rich enough. The lobster pieces were small and bechamel sauce was too light and unlike the other lobster pot pies I have had and no taste (most of them get it with sherry I guess) The steak was too rare and lobster salad was salty. Now for a bistro style place it was underwhelming. The kitchen is quite small and maybe that explains the long wait. The service and booze options added half a star otherwise we are looking at 2.5 Star max as we paid reasonable amount of money here. Th\", 'actual_label': 48, 'predicted_label': 48}, {'text': \"e drink menu is awe inspiring with pages and pages of cocktails and a very good beer list. 3 Star with the help of service and booze selection. Its hard to recommend a bistro type place where the alcohol over shadows the food.\\nI came here as part of the Indie Coffee Passport (ICP) \\nThis is a small cafe with limited seating. They do bake their good in house so there is nice aroma emanating in the space.  \\nhere is the verdict on the cappuccino\\nEspresso: Medium/strong flavor\\nCrema': OK\\nMilk: Frothed well nice microfoam.\\nLatte Art: decent\\nI would say 3 stars. \\nWe also tried a pineapple/carrot muffin and despite my reservations it did taste good.\\n3 stars all said and done.\\nI was really looking forward to my trip here as this place's claim to fame is the largest store of its kind in Canada.\\nThe setup has the space to substantiate this claim, however it leaves a lot to be desired. \\nThe place is suitably bright and is full of items from Bed Bath and Beyond! \\nI spent my time walking around firs\\nt and spent an hour or so in this store. Sure they have all the bases covered and if you need an item from this kind of store they probably have it. However even with the 20% off promo they are priced around the Bay Store option. \\nI decided to put the staff through their paces and asked them very specific questions and sadly the staff in some areas is not up to par. I guess we can attribute it to teething problems but they should be more service oriented and if they don't know about something they should ask someone else more experienced instead of resorting to the we don't have it routine. \\nThe sad part is I was able to find something similar to what I was looking for myself even though the sales person had given up. \\nThey ought to learn from the smaller operation a few minutes away on what service is about,  sure they have the raw variety to put the little guy out of business but what I learned in business is The way to beat Bobby Fischer is do not play chess with him! \\nWhile they ha\\nve Bed and Bath Covered its the Beyond that scares me, kudos to the people who get the family guy reference here :) \\n2.5 Stars\\nThis review is for the restaurant area of this place. \\nWhile the dessert/candy shop area is interesting to look at the restaurant area leave a lot to be desired. It does get slammed late at night so we had to wait a bit to get a place.  Seeing mussels on the menu my buddy and I decided to order some as we in the mood for something light.\\nThe food took its time to arrive and it was sad state of affairs after that.\\nAlmost 90% of the mussels were not open (mean they were either not cooked properly or were dead!) or the shell was broken (that means I had to gamble whether they were dead or alive before cooking) seeing this I flagged a server couple of times showing what the heck is wrong here. Even an area manager passed by and commented they are not supposed to be like this. No offer of replacing the order or comping it. Seriously this is unacceptable what if I wa\\ns someone who didn't know you are not supposed to eat dead or unopened mussels! Food poisoning bad as it is can be fatal from shell fish. \\nI will take my business elsewhere in the future. \\nThe Server  and view of the strip  added another star here otherwise we are looking at a total disaster here.\\nAfter a major disappointment at the go to AYCE in downtown I swore off going to an AYCE places at least  in downtown core. \\nAh well one has to give in to peer pressure once in a while. My buddy and I decided to try this place out after catching a movie. The place is right opposite the movie theater so that made it easy. The location is prime IMO and is right on the main hub of activity. \\nThe setup is high tech if that makes sense to you (read a lot of neon and modern interior)\\nWe were seated promptly and got the most ridiculously over sized table that could seat 6 easy for the 2 of us. Oh goodie more places to put the dishes I guess.\\nOrdering is high tech going with the theme here as one gets\\n an iPad with a custom app and one gets to order from it (though a server needs to validate the order for submission) \\nHigh marks for putting tech to good use.\\nNow for the main attraction IMO the food there is your regular AYCE Japanese items and they even have Thai food that's not so Thai IMO (more on that later)\\nWe ordered a medley of AYCE favs like some Tempura, Sushi Rolls, Salad, Teriyaki, Teppanyaki, Sushi and Sashimi in the first round. The food started to arrive promptly nothing really stood out as it was just the filler stuff. Some of the meat items were actually sub par. \\nWe ordered some Thai items such as Satay stuff as well and they were not Thai IMO. Just some hot sauce that had no hint peanut.\\nOn to the dessert my ordered his ice cream medley and I went for tiramisu. Ice cream was OK according to my friend tiramisu was just average.\\nFor food I would say 2-2.5 stars as it is a place to fill up. Service was very efficient so half star bump for that.\\nThis location is quite s\", 'actual_label': 48, 'predicted_label': 48}, {'text': \"mall compared to other Sobeys I have been to. The service is almost nonexistent and you have to chase someone to get something ask where things are. Prices are in line with other mid-high end stores (the specials make it worthwhile to shop here and sometimes you can make a good mileage run for Aeroplan :) my just buying stuff for bonus points.) I think with the huge Longos close by they need to get their act together. If you are a Sobeys fan I recommend the location on front street which happens to be 24 hours as well.\\nThis tobacconist is located in the Greek Town area. They have big cabinet style humidor not really walk in except for the owner. Prices are in line with other shops. \\nThe owner was helpful and spent some time with me pointing out the various brands they carry and recommending me what to try. Lots of accessories and there isn't sales pressure. \\nThey do accept credit cards. If I am in this area of town I wouldn't mind making a purchase here.\\nI came here for a Christmas din\\nner with my friends family. We were a group of 12 and ordered a set menu, drinks were done BYOB.\\nMy gracious host ordered a 15 course meal/set menu and we waited the arrival of our food. \\nFirst course was a traditional dish consisting of BBQ pork with jelly fish. I don't eat pork but did try the Jelly fish. It was seasoned well as for the pork my fellow diners commented it was a good iteration of this traditional dish.\\n2nd dish was deep fried crab claws with crab meat (I am a big fan of this dish and was expecting a lot more) the batter was not crisp (no panko) and most of the meat was dried out. A very average take on this classic. \\n3rd Dish was Scallops with king mushroom and vegetables in clear sauce (I am trying to translate the ethnic names into the explanation I was given so some might seem odd) This was done very well not a hint of grease and showed the skill of the chef as he didn't use any oil to help himself  to get this dish to shine. \\nShark Fin soup before everyone pulls ou\\nt their pitch forks and starts commenting on how unethical this dish is I would like to state I have little appreciation for this dish and could have lived without it but being old school I have try it as not to offend my host full stop!! There were bits of shark fin in this soup but mostly chicken was used to get the volume. I have had much better versions of this soup elsewhere.\\nChinese Style Beef Steak this is one of my go to dish whenever I go to a traditional Chinese restaurant  and luckily it didn't disappoint. The meat was tender and done close to perfection the sauce was sweet without being overwhelming. A very good take on this dish high recommendations here. \\nShitake Mushrooms stuffed with scallops and baby bok choy in oyster sauce. While this dish looked beautiful unfortunately it didn't live up to its presentation.The mushrooms and scallops turned a bit gritty due to over cooking. Bok Choy and oyster  sauce were good though.\\nDynamite Oysters were flambe'd and served nice an\\nd warm. Initial taste was very good as there was very little hint of oil even though it was deep fried. I was expecting a kick given I could see all the hot pepper seeds. I would recommend eating this dish hot as it loses its texture real fast.\\nNext dish was garlic chicken and the skin was nice and crisp however some of the meat was dried out a very average dish.\\nLobster with Ginger and clear sauce. Its lobster for crying out loud and it hard to screw this up so I enjoyed this dish thoroughly. Good skills shown by the chef again. \\nSteamed fish with scallions and soy.

Again a simple dish which is hard to master but this one was done well. \\nNow came the filler courses (basically shitake mushroom noodles and seafood rice) meh nothing special but I don't expect these to be standouts.   \\nDessert were a combination of three items one stuffed with black sesame seeds in gooey center (served warm) red bean soup and steamed dumpling with taro centre. I am not a big \\nfan of desserts from this region and they were as expected.\\nAll in all a very decent xmas meal and I am grateful to my gracious host for including me in this family meal. \\n3.5 stars (much better than one can get in downtown)  but if one has come out this far there are better options.\\nPretty big space and nice sized Humidor Not really walk in. Prices are bit high and on the last visit they didn't even have the machine working that would accept interac! Selection is ok with all the major labels from Cuba covered well and some other brands thrown in for good measure. The owner was helpful and seemed knowledgeable. For the area I think there prices are high.\\nI tried out this place on a whim as was passing by their website mentioned they close early but upon inquiring I was told that they are open till 9 PM as they are trying out different schedules. I would call ahead though if visiting after 7.\\nThe place is clean and has a too the point setup. Not much space to linger and dine though so m\", 'actual_label': 48, 'predicted_label': 48}, {'text': \"ore of a grab and go kind of place.  I picked up half dozen for 8.95 and ordered a combo of Beef (Hot) and chicken (medium) spice levels as the friends I was visiting nearby don't eat hot food.\\nMy reference point for patties are mainly store bought and frozen type. These do fare better but not enough for me to convert to liking this item. The medium spicy chicken actually tasted spicier somehow (I guess chicken lends itself to spices). I don't have a reference point for what a good patties is supposed to taste or how to tell whether they are authentic but one can do a lot worse for a lot more in this area.\\nThis is an interesting addition to Yorkville. A korean inspired dessert place is sure off the beaten path! The setup is decent with a nice zen like feel and neat touches like dried flowers that somehow lend color to the space. Kudos to a good design. \\nI tried the the yam tiramisu on this visit. It is made to order so freshness is guaranteed. I personally think tiramisu fares better i\\nf it is allowed to settle overnight. The serving is small but the tastes are nuanced and balanced. I think I will revisit to try other desserts though they are better suited to the summer weather. 3.5 stars for a now with a promise of an update when I try other offerings.\\nI am a big fan of Costco and make it a point to visit them whenever I visit a new city to check out the different things that they carry from the mainstream items.\\nThis store doesn't disappoint as in addition to the mainstream items found across the country one can find Quebec specific items here.\\nI just luv luv the wine rack here as they sell some quality stuff I haven't seen anywhere else. I picked up a hard cider from here last time and it was amazing.\\nIn addition I picked up some nice pate' from here and picked up some excellent oysters at Costco legendary quality at an affordable price mantra. \\nThe cheese section is specially worth a visit here and one can find some interesting items that I haven't seen elsewhere\\n. The bread section is nice as well.\\nSo what is there not to like you can buy cheap gas and load up on goodies.\\nThe consistent complaints about poor service seemed to have taken its effect for the better as the service was decent to excellent in the past few visits. Special mention to an associate who was patient and took time to listen to my questions about buying a bicycle and what I needed to meet the city requirements etc. The bike was on special and wasn't even showing up on the in store flyer (odd) Anyway the associate helped locate it in the system and since it required some assembly my contact number was taken down so I could pick it up when it was ready and I was assured since I was waiting nearby they would expedite it. Sure enough I got a call within half an hour!\\nThanks for providing good service.\\nMy main forway to this place are for the specials they have for cookware as they are hard to beat, other than that I come here for basic items that I can't source nearby so those \\nare the main draw as I haven't expected much here otherwise.\\n3.5 Star\\nThe dearth of decent Mexican food continues in Toronto. Again I fail to understand why people continue to flock to below average food (at this price nonetheless). \\nThe place is at an odd stretch of residential street which has some commercial businesses thrown in. The setup is for the lack of better word basic. We were seated upstairs as the place was quite busy. Beware unless you prefer deafening noise from other fellow diners, coupled with loud music as an acceptable dining space wait out for the patio or the dining area below. The place was so loud that I had a headache by the end of the meal.\\nI had the crispy taco with beef rib (also the chicken version of the same) and surprisingly the shell was different among the two. The chicken version was a soggy mess IMO. The beef rib didn't fare much better. This coupled with the fact that they somehow misplaced my order made me not want to come here again. They did comp \\nthe dessert which is a nice gesture to make up for the atrocious wait. I suggest you keep looking for a better option.\\nOh boy this place fits the greasy diner model to a T. I walked in early on a Friday and the place was not busy. Everything I touched seemed to be covered by an oily sheen of some kind.  Not pleasant. The service is OK. I ordered the avacado and tomato benedict. Added a side of home fries. Not quite what I expected from fries. The rest was your run of a mill stuff I would say a step above the free breakfast at a motel. Reasonably priced for this area I suppose. Might fit the bill if you are looking for this type of thing.\\nThis place is downright amazing for baked goods. I was hesitant to share this spot but heck sharing is caring or Yelp is a gift that keeps on giving.... insert cliche' here. \\nI had only tried their biscotti before hand and only recently got to try their cookies.

They do use a syrup to get flavor so don't be expecting fresh ground macadamias to get the essence here. More on the sweet side I would say it might even satisfy your need for a dessert.\\nI came here as part of Indie Coffee Passport (ICP)\\nThe setup is OK for this place and I guess their forte is ice cream as I can't fathom the poor espresso based drinks here. The seating is minimal and too the point which is just all right. There seemed to be some regulars there just working on their stuff and staying put. This was the second stop on the ICP so just wanted a quick cappuccino.\\nHere is the verdict to the cappuccino\\nEspresso: Mild\\nCrema': below average\\nMilk: Frothed poorly and not latte art to speak off\\n.\\nThis is a very poor attempt at a Cappuccino.\\nI would say 2 stars and that's pushing it already.\\nOrdered some take out from this place and I ordered the following three dishes\\nLemon Chicken: Lemon sauce good chicken was OK.\\nEmperor Beef (Hot): Not hot enough IMO lots of veggies \\nSweet and Sour Prawns: were surprisingly still pipping hot when I got them. 8 good sized pieces (mostly batter) \\nPortion size  ranged from OK (Beef) to generous (chicken)\\nFood is typical Americanized version i.e. lotsa batter on fried items. You do feel heavy after eating the food but I guess that's the idea. \\nService was great as I got a call from them half and hour before delivery that might be running late due to the rush hour even though they delivered on time.\\nIf I want my greasy Chinese fix this is the place I would call.\\nAnother off shoot the bagel house. I am quite familiar with the original spot and the mid town location. This one is decent as well. This was a spur of the moment purchase as I am parti\\nal to their liver sandwich. The oven wasn't running on this visit (I think the original runs 24/7 if I recall) but the bagel was decent nonetheless. Nice chewy texture with a sweet finish courtesy of the honey water. \\nI am by no means a connoisseur for bagels let alone Montreal style. Good stuff for what you pay 3.5 stars.\\nThis place caters to the home/small office java needs. I accidentally went to the commercial operation showroom upstairs by accident but was directed towards this showroom by a friendly sale person. \\nThe setup is gorgeous and showcases the beautiful machines they carry from Jura/Giotto/Elektra to name a few. \\nI am in the market for a espresso machine as my current unit has served me well. I did my homework and have narrowed down the list. This store is an authorized dealer for the highly rated Giotto Rocket and Elektra machines so I thought it would be a good idea to try both out.\\nI was pleasantly greeted by a sales associate. I explained by budget and the kind of ma\\nchine I was looking for and then I was given various options. \\nThe offer automatic machines as well as they traditional style units. I was more interested in the traditional style so was shown those units first. The Sales person took his time and explained the various features of the machines that were in my price range. I was even offered a shot from one the machine I was considering definitely a big plus if you ask me.\\nNext came the automatic units which offer the convenience of almost one button operation though lack the creativity IMO. I was again allowed to sample an espresso shot from the machines which made me think that maybe automatic is the way I want to go.\\nIn addition this place offers a lot of coffee related accessories and coffee beans (whole and ground versions) that I haven't seen elsewhere and the prices were surprisingly good. I also found a tamper that I have been eyeing online for a while.\\nIn short a very good experience indeed and I would consider this place for my\", 'actual_label': 48, 'predicted_label': 48}, {'text': ' vinaigrette. The option for whole wheat tortillas is a welcomed addition. I am not sure why a salad comes with it. Just seems like a huge open face burrito now. I like how they load up with cilantro, lettuce, guacamole, pico de gallo, and even give a slice of lime. What I listed only comprises half of the ingredients available. They have monterey jack, cheddar and cojita cheese, and tortilla strips. \\n\\nThis is a perfect meal for two or for one broke college student.\\nIt has been some time since I had visited this plaza. In between visits, the previous business had been replaced by Island. Looking over the menu and around the restaurant, not too much has changed. \\n\\nWanting to break the monotony of the same cuisine with one of my friends, I had suggested coming here. The large restaurant was steady, but nowhere near full capacity. \\n\\nBoth of us were hungry enough to get an appetizer to share, and individual entrees. To start, I had ordered the crispy pork intestines for us. They were not q\\nuite crispy, but they were melt in your mouth. Unlike most intestine I have had, this one was stuffed with green onions and then fried until the outer layer was golden brown like the skin of a roasted duck. The hoisin style and chili sauce complimented the meat while the pickled diakon and carrots helped cleanse the palate of greasy. I followed this up with the ginger scallion duck with rice. You can get a full order, for $12, but I don\\'t think it comes with rice. Plus no matter how hungry I am, I couldn\\'t eat a family portion on my own. So for $7-$8, it was a good serving. Now this is where Island started to lose me. The dish was rather bland. Normally I don\\'t complain about that in Asian food, but with strong flavors such as ginger and scallions, it should be more prevalent and bold. The pieces of meat were the bonier pieces over the rib cage, so most of my time was spent picking off bits of meat. What I did get off of the bone was dry. My friend got the BBQ pork fried rice and Malay\\nsian coffee. He seemed to be happy with his order. \\n\\nThe food warrants three stars, but the service made me want to move it to a four. All the servers here were attentive to our water glasses and as soon as food was placed on the counter, it was moving towards a table. \\n\\nLike the previous review, make sure to bring cash, because cards are not accepted at the moment.\\nFriendly staff and great deals equals for an easy shopping experience. There are a few new lines of fragrances. Some border on the obnoxious candy side while others are more subtle. I personally come here for the body scrubs, candles, and hand soaps when in doubt on what to gift to people. They are a safe bet and tend to be pleasant additions to a more personalized item.\\n\\nRight now the deal is buy 2, get 1 free or buy 3, get two free on select items.\\nWARNING: Ample amounts of time is needed if you plan to get anything done here. It is a school and the students are refining the basics while working on their technique. \\n\\nRece\\nntly my work schedule has been all messed up. I tried to get an appointment with my regular salon and they were booked full. I saw my sister\\'s review of this place and thought I would give it a chance since it was so close to the house.\\n\\nMy hairstylist, Anthony, was very good. He was meticulous about making sure I got what I wanted. Nothing is worst than ending up with a messed up head. He consulted the instructors when he got to a part where he was unsure of. Asian hair and my cowlick does not make it easy for anyone unfamiliar with this style. He did a great job. So did the other two instructors who jumped in to guide him through it. With my job, I am able to get away with crazier hairstyles and he followed the example photo well. I would come back here if my stylist ever gets booked up again, but keep in mind, my cut took two hours.\\nAsian supermarkets are the way to go for inexpensive produce. SF is the most well lit, organized, and clean out of them all. The fruits and vegetables a\\nre the main reason why I come. Apples, pears, oranges, pomelos, avocados, and various Vietnamese herbs are usually fresh. They have it all and they are way cheaper than American supers.\\nAnother nice venue in downtown for a chill time. The crowd always goes wild for the singing bartenders. Although they appreciate the cheers, they also appreciate you tipping their jugs. Slip some bills down their shirts after one of their stunning performances. The music tends to be more old school rock and some pop. It is not just the bar staff who sings. Sometimes they have regulars that will grace the stage. Yesterday, one brought the house down with her rendition of \"I will always love you\". It was not a tacky way to pay tribute to the departed diva. \\n\\nI am not sure if sitting up front made it more difficult to understand some of the words, but there were a few songs where I could not figure out what Kenny was singing.

Thank goodness for Alfred Angelo, because they have made a good part of the dress and accessory shopping easy.\\n\\nMy friend is a simple kind of girl and marrying into an Asian family. At first, we thought finding a gown that would make her happy would be difficult. First time into this shop and we were able to find a gorgeous dress with red incorporated into the train and sash.

Wine is a great social lubricant that aided in quite a few groups (including MeetUp and Yelp)  to have a good time and learn about this ambrosial beverage. \\n\\nThe two ice wines offered at this event, a Riesling and Vidal, were exquisite. The Riesling was the softer and lighter of the two, while the Vidal was stronger in taste and aromatics. The lychee scent and flavor of the latter was prevalent as soon as it met with the senses.  The viscosity had a similar thickness of a good balsamic vinegar, or syrup, which made me want to drizzle some on top of ice cream. This might be a good ice wine to experiment in making a sorbet. Time to bust out the ice cream maker.  The mixed drink was heavy on the vodka and drowned out the fla\\nvor of the ice wine. The ratio of one ounce of wine to three parts vodka was uneven. The appetizers were a delicious pairing to our drinks. The duck spring rolls and lobster/crab cakes were generous on the protein. Not to forget about the phenomenal chocolate truffles that warranted multiple tries. By the end I had eaten three; the peanut butter and jelly, a salted caramel, and a ganache. Each of them were decadently superb and complimented the wines well.\\n\\nIf in the Niagara area, this vineyard is a must stop destination. It is no surprise that Donald Ziraldo is heralded as a king of ice wine.

The company of other Yelpers was fantastic. Now this is what sweet dreams are made of!\\nBy no means will Rani be the first place I think of for Indian cuisine. The plates have a decent variety of dishes, but nothing spectacular. Tod\\nay's thali platter consisted of a saag, lentils, and a paneer dish with onions, rice, and pickles. I enjoyed the saag because of the hints of ginger, but the other items were mediocre. I ended up dabbing my bread off with napkins before bites due to how much oil was on them. Everything else was forgettable though. The vegetable samosas were delicious. They were predominantly potatoes with peas. The chutneys were refreshing and flavorful. Dipping these golden pockets in the sauce made for good eats. The mango lassi was the other highlight of the meal. It was not too sweet and had a robust taste ripe mangoes.\\nReminiscent of everything that is popular and wonderful about Korean baked goods. This is one of the three biggest chain bakeries in South Korea. Vegas is pretty lucky to have one here because Koreans are serious about their pastries and coffee. \\n\\nThe atmosphere is decorated in a garden style that creates a year round warmness. At first you might think that Crown has a small selecti\\non, but in reality they have about the same amount as their Chinese competitors.  You just won't find taro or BBQ pork buns here. Instead you will get pizza breads and the Mr. Kim Bun. The latter is amazing. If taro is my favorite, this would take a close second. The crunchy/creaminess of the peanuts helps mellow out the red bean. I can only eat so much the sweet paste, but this bread is great.  I still break it into smaller servings, but the bread is moist and does not dry out as quickly as other places. I just wished that they had sweet potato bread because that was my all time favorite while living abroad. It was dangerous, consider yourself lucky that there is not one on every corner.\\n\\nThe coffee is great here. I got an iced black Americano and it was not bitter at all. It was strong and gave me the boost that I needed to get through my errands.  \\n\\nIf you plan on using your card, you must spend over $10.\\nPing Pang Pong is a go to place for when some of my friends want to get togeth\", 'actual_label': 49, 'predicted_label': 27}, {'text': \"er for crab.

So much fried garlic goes on top of both dishes. \\n\\nPPP is a hit or miss. The green tea smoked duck was not something we enjoyed. I ended up just wanting Peking duck and was sad to see that they don't offer it. The sweet and pungent lotus roots are always a must. Add that with the three dishes I list above and you don't really need anything else. \\n\\nThe dim sum here is good. It is just pricey compared to other places. \\n\\nJust be prepared.

With my sister back in tow\\nn for the summer, we were the dynamic duo of shopping. Days were dedicated to travel from one side of town to another, but we come here for our basics at bargain prices. There was a drought season where I didn't buy anything from GAP and walking into this store quickly changed that. For the most part, this mid range store tends to play it safe and clean cut for a moderate price. \\n\\nThe employees are quick to help, but also know to not swarm around their clientele.

Throughout the year, I like to go watch it from time to time to see the changes, but my favorites will always be Time to Say Goodbye or My Heart will Go On because of the family and friends I see it with.

It is a step above fast food quality, but there are many other places that offer better dishes, bigger portion, and cheaper prices especially during lunch time. The lunch specials lack in all of the above. \\n\\nI had ordered the eggplant in garlic sauce and it was ok. I don't have anything more to say about it. The deal comes with a bowl of egg flour soup, a large helping of rice, and sauteed cabbage. The last item threw me for a loop. I normally like the idea of getting a veggie with my meal, but cabbage is never at the top of the list. It is cheap and adds little to a meal. My friends ordered the sweet and sour spareribs and a pork chow fun. The first item was not bad, they gave nice chunks of pork that were juicy. The sauce was lacking in flavor. It is a rare occasion for anyone to say Chinese food is lacking in seasoning. While the chow fu\\nn was nothing great. It wasn't even on the specials list. So for full price, the portion was small.\\nThree Square is one of my favorite volunteer opportunities in the valley. Thanks to Terri R, we had a chance to give back to our community.

Having Dianne around to reassure me that it is difficult to get use poking yourself in the eye at first helped.  At first I cringed in retrospect from my first foray into hard lenses.

The drinks are cheap and strong. The atmosphere is fun with a large dance floor in the center and one lone go-go dancer... on a pedestal. I am not exactly sure where Charlie\\'s is going with their mixture of drag queens and gay cowboys, but I\\'ll roll with it. I am all about the western shirts anyways.

T\\nuesdays are drag queen bingo night starting at 9:30pm. I might just grab one of my Filipino moms and \"drag\" them along. Thursdays are all day country music and half price drinks. Line dancing lessons are provided as well. I caught that much. There are inked nights to show off your tattoos for free booze. Underwear nights for those who have an aversion to pants. \\n\\nSunday apparently is not one of the hopping nights. We came around 1:30am and it was semi busy at the bar, but barren everywhere else. The room gets smoky quickly and the ventilation is not that good. The bartenders are fun. A mixture of some sass and honest is appreciated. While one made fun of our initial hesitance to drink and our quick jump to doing shots, another was kind enough to tell us to wait a few minutes until they started their happy hour. After 2am, beers were $1.75.\\nAs MGM\\'s option for a cafe, Wolfgang\\'s teeters on a casual and upscale dining experience. The completely open restaurant has few obstructions on the\\n inside or from the outside. Too bad the people that wander by do not make for good people watching. \\n\\nThe food is delicious, but what made it better was the overall service. At points they were inattentive, but the complete experience was not bad. The fact that we shared everything and did not have to ask for anything to be split or an extra plate was amazing. They served our crab cakes, burger, and kabocha pumpkin agnolotti pasta as separate items for us. That simple gesture was impressive to me. \\n\\nThe crab cake came in an order of four. The light mixture of tomatoes and basil enhanced the sweetness of the crab well. The burger was salty. It is not a knock your socks off type of ordeal. The pasta was my favorite. The kabocha resembles a butternut squash and takes on the flavor of the brown butter sage sauce. The toast hazelnuts adds a much needed textural variation. \\n\\nWe ended our meal with the chocolate beignets. NOT A BEIGNET! It is more of a chocolate lava cake doughnut hole. They\\n are good if you look at them like that, but as a beignet they failed.\\nFor a while they were known as the go to place for Chinese BBQ. Now I wonder how they stay in business. With crooked practices, you have to watch them carefully.\\n\\nOn a few occasions, my family and I have been cheated by them. They have calculated our bill wrong. Then there are the times that they have taken a duck leg when we ordered a whole bird to take home. A one legged duck is not a common sight, so I do not know how they thought they could get away with it. My dad did not let this slide and raised hell. They of course apologized, but the next time another part was missing. \\n\\nThe food is nothing special compared to the prices they charge. Go upstairs to Capital Seafood or go down the street to Cafe Noodle. If you like Chinese BBQ go to the take out restaurant connected to the International Marketplace. They are a fraction of the price and do not try to pull the wool over their customers.\\nI will always pick the C\\noffee Bean over their corporate competitors because they actually taste good.

It took my sister two passes and a glances over the board to understand what they were selling. A fraco is virtually a taco made with a mu shu pancake or crepe. It is boasted as a healthier version of a taco since they are less in calories than a tortilla. They sell savory fare as well as dessert options. A look at their advertisement had me excited because the picture looked like a chocotaco. Once we stepped inside, a \\nreally friendly staff member explained the whole concept to us. For $3.75 you get a choice of two crepe tacos or one waffle. \\n\\nMy sister and I were almost full after enjoying dinner and opted for the lighter crepe style. We were not so excited after seeing that the thin pancakes were premade and sat in the fridge. We had ordered ours with nutella and berries. They are very generous with the chocolate spread and squeezed an exorbitant into each. We ended up removing half from each. The employees were really nice and allowed us to create our own. We picked blueberries and raspberries. Overall, it was too heavy due to the nutella and whipped cream. If they used less of that and had ice cream instead it would have made all the difference. \\n\\nI cringe in giving a new business such a poor rating, but I hope that they can address this issue and give Town Square another casual dessert option.\\nOne look at the playground will make any adult jealous.

Instead of feeling happy for the younger generations, I find that I envy them.\\n\\nThe park has nice clean paths that are pet friendly. Every so often there are litter bags and trashcans to dispose of pet waste. Please do not leave your pet\\'s \"gifts\" around when they conveniently place these amenities there. \\n\\nThe best part about Exploration Park is the view of Vegas from the top of the mountain. It is not strenuous, fifteen minutes at a leisurely pace. If you take a casual stroll up, you can see the strip and how spread out our city is. They have a deck and two picnic tables. When the weather is nice, it is wonderful to pack a lunch and eat while enjoying the view.\\nI go to Whole Foods from time to time to get groceries, but t\\nhey tend to be on the higher side to use them as a constant option. Instead, I like WF for their bulk beauty supplies, their pre-made foods, and their smoothie bar. Compared to the one in Town Square, it is lacking in the last two fields. I came in and ended up walking out. I could not find anything.\\nFor being down the street from my house, I tend to forget about Jun\\'s when the Korean mood strikes. I am not sure why, but this whole complex tends to be a blackout zone on my radar. \\n\\nWhen I walked in around 11:30am, all the employees were having lunch before everyone came. I sat down at a table and was quickly greeted and asked about something to drink. After a minute, my server was back with my water and took my order. \\n\\nSince it was my first time here, I wanted to try as much as possible without going overboard. Instead of ordering an insane amount of food,rI ordered the Jun\\'s Special. Consisting of bulgogi, kalbi, chicken, meat jun, rice, salad, and a fried dumpling, it was enough of \\na taste. It was pretty standard fare. I subbed out the white rice with brown for an extra $.50. It was dry and could have been cooked with more water. The meat jun and kalbi were my favorite. The mandoo was very crisp and the filling was predominately meat. It was not just a bunch of veggies and noodles like other places. The spices inside was spot on. I might just order a plate of this the next time I go. For $11.95, it is a diverse taste of their meat offerings. I am excited about the cold buckwheat noodles. They start serving that from June to September.\\nMy family and I have been going to this place for many years now. It is just one of those places that we go to when we want good Chinese food and my parents do not feel like cooking. I grew up in a house where my dad is a chef varied in many styles of cooking and my mom is magic in the kitchen and this place has only disappointed us once.\\n\\nThe manager and staff are all friendly and efficient. We usually go around lunch time to late ', 'actual_label': 49, 'predicted_label': 49}, {'text': \"afternoon because they run specials which will save you quite a bit. \\n\\nThe meal usually begins with hot and sour soup. It is nothing special, but it is a nice start to the meal.\\n\\nThe usual order consists of one fried fish in a sweet and sour Vietnamese style fish sauce with onions and sliced fresh peppers. This is always a family favorite and the small bones around the outside of the fish are edible, just think of them as another source of calcium. Just be careful, I don't want you to think that all of the bones can be eaten, the large ones should be thrown aside. \\n\\nThe kung pao tofu is another staple of our visit because the tofu is cubed and fried until crispy on the outside and still soft and most on the inside. It is then sauteed in a sauce with peanuts, dried red chilies, and green onions. This is my favorite dish. \\n\\nThe seafood hotpot is layered with napa cabbage on the bottom that soaks up all the flavors of everything within. There is a imitation crab and fish cakes, but there \\nare also nice chunks of white fish, shrimp, mushrooms, and other assorted ingredients that escape me right now. \\n\\nThey have a delicious sweet and sour pork chops dish that is served with sauteed onions that is wonderful. The sauce is not overwhelmingly sweet and a bit more on the tangy side, an aspect that I enjoy immensely.\\n\\nWe also get a vegetable dish that resembles alfalfa sprouts that is sauteed with garlic. I forget what it is called, but it is delicious. \\n\\nAt the end, the wait staff will bring out a small bowl of sweet dessert soup. It is not very sweet and that is a good thing after eating so much greasy food. \\n\\nJust remember to go there for lunch and you will be pleased with how much you are paying for a generous portion. I am not a fan of quantity over quality, and this place proves that you can have both. We pay somewhere around 35 for a large feast that you still have leftovers.\\nAfter Restaurant Week, my stomach was craving something simple. No more three to four course mea\\nls. No more fine dining atmosphere. No more elaborate restaurant hoping. All I wanted was the neverending soup, salad, and breadsticks. \\n\\nWhen my friend and I got off of work, we booked it to the OG to get our fix. For less than $8, we could have ate til our hearts content. Our server, Ray, was attentive with drink refills, soup swaps, and salad changes. After two soups and a salad each, we called it quits. Even if we had not, Ray would have kept it coming.\\nEngine 1 Pizza came out to cater the second Edible Vegas forum. It was nice to see a food truck out when the discussion fell on if this outlet helps or hurt the industry.  With some bold flavors and ingredient combinations, they do help boost awareness in Las Vegas food culture. \\n\\nThey might not be my favorite pizza joint, but what they produce is delicious. My group had bought the pesto, goat cheese, and tomato pizza before the function. For some, the combination of the equally strong goat cheese and pesto was overbearing, but I li\\nked it. The tomatoes on top helped to give some texture and mellow out the flavors. For $14, some might think it is steep, but it was quality. What is really amazing is their 700 degree oven. It can cook the thin crust pizza to a golden crispy brown in two minutes. Applause should be given to the owners for being eco-friendly. I wish I could remember what Katrina M. was saying about how their efforts were benefiting the environment, but I had enjoyed one too many at happy hour.\\nBrunch and I have a love hate relationship. I love me an excuse to drink early in the day. I love me the straddled line between breakfast and lunch. I also love me the $35 something price tag for their all you can eat brunch. Add $8 for all you can drink mimosas and I am on my way to a great Sunday afternoon. \\n\\nThey do small plates for all of their brunch offerings. If you are there with a large party, they will prepare items on platters and present it family style. \\n\\nWhat we had:\\n\\nGreen corn tamales- It was les\\ns a solid tamale and more of a corn pudding style in consistency. The flavors were amazing. It has a little kick, but the corn was so bright and sweet. \\n\\nPlantain Empandas- The sweetness of the bananas balanced out the saltiness of the cheese and black beans. The green chilies made it a well rounded dish.\\n\\nBacon Jalapeno PB&J- Loved this dish. It is a fat kids dream. A breakfast sandwich jammed together with every kids favorite simple sandwich makes me drool a little bit. I won't lie, I make these at home from time to time and this version is everything I want it to be and more.\\n\\nPeruvian Shrimp and Grits- Uh, yes please. The sauce has a kick and the grits are creamy.\\n\\nSkirt Steak and Eggs- The meat and eggs are cooked to perfect. The best protein on the menu.\\n\\nYucatan Eggs Benedict- Too much biscuit. It is basically a toad in a hole, but overwhelming.\\n\\nMachaca Chiaquiles- A pile of mush. Odd dish.\\n\\nShort Rib Hash and Eggs- Too many eggs by this point. How many innocent casualties must\", 'actual_label': 49, 'predicted_label': 49}, {'text': \" be left in our path!\\n\\nChurro Tots- Not as good as they sound. Odd sweet and sourness to them. Not quite a beignet, not quite a doughnut.\\n\\nFig & Blue Cheese Quesadillas- The figs were the best part. Everything else got left behind.\\n\\nLobster Pancakes- The biggest disappointment of the day. Little to no lobster sprinkled on top and it was an actual pancake. Weird combination.\\n\\nBy the end, we were all tired and stuffed. The beginning half of the menu is by far the better half. I could have stopped at the Churro Tots and not think twice about the rest.\\nThe countdown has begun. Halloween is just around the corner and the perfect costume has yet to be obtained. Scouring the thrift stores has proved to be fruitless, so a trip to an actual Halloween retail shop was in order. Too bad Halloween Express does not have much of a selection in men's costumes. Besides the generic gladiator, pirate, or ridiculously raunchy, there was nothing else. \\n\\nThe selections on superhero costumes was rather pathe\\ntic even with the popularity of Batman and the Avengers. I found more options at one of the thrift stores I stopped by afterwards.\\nSpring Restaurant Week 2013:\\n\\nDay 3 on my intense culinary trek. This was a last minute substitution because our intended restaurant was closed on Sunday- Monday. It must be divine intervention! I would have missed out on this amazing journey.\\n\\nFrom start to finish it was a splendid experience. A friend and I came directly after work. We got there half an hour early for our reservation and sat at the bar. I tried the Capone's Rye. It is one of those cocktails that gets more intense the longer it sits. As it adjusted in temperature, the more I can taste all of the alcohol. It is a true martini in nature. All alcohol and very little filler. Rye whiskeys are making a comeback and I want to get into them. Maybe next time I will take baby steps. One cocktail was more than enough for me. \\n\\nWhen our third person came, we were sat promptly. We decided to all do the\\n special menu. The online version made it seem like the diner had to choose between three set menus. When looking at the paper, it is all presented as a mix and match of your liking. We decided to skip the beef barley soup and opted for two pumpkin gnocchis and the wedge salad. Smartest move EVER! The gnocchi was hands down the best dish of the night. Our server was considerate enough to split anything that could be divided. The pumpkin gnocchi tasted like fall. All the traditional spices; cinnamon and nutmeg is present in them. The proscuitto and blue cheese added a nice saltiness. The bitterness from the arugula gave the dish a nice contrast in texture. The same could be said about the roasted hazelnuts. Sweetness came in the form of poached pears. The wedge salad was also very good. Just not as good as the gnocchi. In hindsight, we should have all just got our own plate of that.\\n\\nWe then ordered one of each entree. The truffle glazed chicken had a beautifully brown and crisp skin. T\\nhe glaze is slightly sweet and complimented the savory mac and cheese well. I was shocked by how moist the chicken was. The steak over a bed of pureed parsnip was decent. The veggies and parsnip was my favorite part. Why not puree other root vegetables? Especially sweet ones. Potatoes are a thing of the past. The halibut was also another item I was thoroughly impressed with. It was cooked to perfection. The outside seared crispy and the center moist. I devoured my piece and the couscous within minutes of it hitting my plate.\\n\\nOne of my dining companions and I was not as enthusiastic about the desserts. All of them were not seasonal selections. They had a berry theme to them, They were still decent. We were so stuffed by this point that it did not even matter. The trifle with strawberries was the highlight offering. The lemon blueberry cheesecake was second. The panacotta had too much gelatin in it. It was stiff.\\nThe good:\\n\\n-The steak swarma is packed with flavor and is cut to a very ge\\nnerous portion. \\n-The babaganoush is smokey and overflowing with rich characteristics.\\n-The salad is a mix of dark greens, chickpeas, tomatoes, purple cabbage, cucumbers and pickled carrot sticks.\\n\\nThe bad:\\n-The falafels and salad are heavy on the oil. The fried chickpea patties tend to absorb too much of the frying oil. The taste was magnificent though. I like that they serve it with hummus for dipping. The salad needed more acid instead of base.\\n-Peanuts are used in the baklava and overpowers the walnuts. Instead of pistachios, Parsley uses peanuts and that is all you can taste. Honey is not a big component of the dessert and it comes out kind of dry. It just reminds me of the peanut toffees you get at the Asian markets.\\n\\nI was amazed that I ordered everything for less than $18. I ended up taking so much of it home. With a few customized request, I could see myself loving Parsley.\\nRound up 15 Yelpers for a potluck picnic in the park and an adventure of epicurean levels are to follow.\", 'actual_label': 49, 'predicted_label': 49}, {'text': \" Apparently this park tends to be rather busy throughout the day and there is a chance that a reservation must be placed in advance. If you are planning to hold a gathering when they do their movies in the park than there is no need to call. \\n\\nThe picnic tables on the Buffalo side, in between the two volleyball pits, has enough room to accommodate a large group. With a BBQ on either sides of the tables, it is easy to prepare everything at once. It would be tougher if this area was shared between two or more parties though.\\n\\nWe came here with the intention of playing in the water features, but they were not on at 8pm. Not sure if there is a way to turn them on, but every nob, lever, or spinner we tried did not work. Even though we were let down about that, the fact that their outlets were on made the night better.\\nJacob Palmer might not approve of the GAP, but I am a huge fan. This is one of the nicest GAP stores in Las Vegas. The selection of clothes is varied. The only issue is their \\nsales area is heavily picked and tends to be slim. \\n\\nWith summer winding down, most of the stores are in the midst of clearing out their inventory. The best part, we stay warm until the end of October. I like the ombre t-shirts and the colored skinny khakis.\\nA few years ago this place was burnt down if I remember correctly. It was rather sad going there one day and just seeing the blacken reminisce of a great bakery. It is nice to see that they have rebuilt and have become bigger without losing the quality of their product. My family and I always loved their French bread. We buy it to go with curries or Vietnamese beef stew. There is something special about this bread. It has a nice crispy flaky outside while the center is moist and spongy. Perfect for soaking up all the wonderful flavors of whatever dish you are eating.\\n\\nTheir rolls are also great if you want to make Vietnamese subs. They are a little bit more pricey then a supermarket, but the quality is unsurpassed. \\n\\nI am glad that\\n it is a bit of a drive otherwise I might be the size of a house.\\nI LOVE THIS PLACE! Katrina M. took me here after I was getting homesick. I have been back almost every week if only to walk around and read the Korean. I love supermarkets. Maybe it is the fact that we all need food to survive and food has always been a source of comfort. Walking around a supermarket in any country I visit is almost as important as seeing a landmark. It speaks more about the people of that area than any other culture center.\\n\\nThe pre-made food section offers a wide selection of banchan (Korean side dishes). I haven't tried any yet, because I am still in the stage of wanting to make my own. I have 8lb. of kimchi sitting in my fridge as proof. Thank you Greenland for stocking all the essential ingredients. ^_^v \\n\\nI have bought their bulgogi since my friends were too impatient to wait for me to marinate my own. I liked it, I would only add some onions, enoki mushrooms, and green onions to give it a little c\\nontrast to the sweetness of the sauce. \\n\\nThe japchae (sesame clear sweet potato noodles with vegetables) was also decent. A little sweeter than I am used to, but it is decent if you add some black pepper and slices of green chili peppers.\\nIs it possible to enter a Ross and end up walking out empty handed? I guess so. This is definitely my hit or miss location. The lack of consistency in their inventory is the only reason why I rank them lower. I can go to this one and find nothing, just to go to another store and score. Maybe since it is in such a nice area, most people scoop up the bounty before I can set eyes on them. \\n\\nThere is a plethora of stores around this area. I won't be discouraged. Instead I will continue to make my rounds and focus on the great deals I do find here.\\nNothing is more gratifying than having control over what you eat. Shabu shabu is light, clean, and comes with unlimited sides. By our western standards, the amount of meat that you get is not abundant, and I am \\nalright with that. The servings come in three different sizes. Jack, a single serving of one protein. Queen, gives you the ability to do two half portions of different meats. Lastly, the king, where you are allowed a more bountiful amount with the option of splitting. \\n\\nEach pot comes in a yin yang pattern to give you the option of having the sukiyaki, regular, or both. I recommend the half and half. The soy sauce base, sukiyaki, is a delicious complement to the spicy and citrus dipping sauces. The regular shabu shabu is best for the peanut sauce because it is a strong flavor with a thick consistency.\\n\\nWhen the meat came out, I thought it would not be enough. As the meal progressed, I had almost forgotten about it completely. Instead I was enjoying the all you can eat vegetables, salad, tofu, and rice. I had polished off four plates of veggies and tofu. Even after eating all that, I left here feeling satisfied and not disgusted.\\n\\nThe server was awesome. She was on top of refilling our \", 'actual_label': 49, 'predicted_label': 49}, {'text': \"drinks, and offering an endless bounty of side dishes. She was so patient with the confused guest that came in after us, walking them through the entire menu and offering suggestions. This debunks my whole argument about being neglected and ignored is how Japanese like their service.\\nLet me begin with how shocked I was once I entered the Golden Nugget. I did not expect it to be so nice. A couple of friends and I were going out for lunch. I was early, so I took a stroll around the property and was blown away by how modern and clean everything was.\\n\\nAt first, I was apprehensive about the separated dining area. During peak hours, crossing traffic to get to the part near the pool must be similar to playing Frogger with a banquet tray. The weather was gorgeous and the pool is beautiful, so I understand why they seat this area first. As the first party there, for lunch, we got a central table near the window. \\n\\nOctober is pizza month. They are running a chef's special for $9.99. The special \\nis a basic cherry tomatoes, mozzarella, and basil pizza. It was delicious and easily shared between two. So why in the world did we get bruschetta, chicken fettuccine alfredo, and lasagna? Both pastas also comes with an Italian salad. It was was overkill. Yet, it was also a death I am willing to experience again. I am not a huge fan of cream sauces, but I even took a few bites of the pasta. The lasagna was my favorite. It is a bit more saucy than I normally like, but the flavor was good. The pizza is a thin crust style that I was thankful for because I could not handle any more carbs. By the time all three of us were finished we had enough to send someone home with leftovers.\\nIt has been forever since I have been back to PJ Clarke's. The first time was not very impressive. This time was the exact opposite. Two of us came for happy hour after an afternoon of shopping at the Forums. It is by far one of the best happy hours on the Strip. Get there a little early because the seats fill up \\nfast in front of the oyster bar. The special runs from 3pm- everyday and it is easy to camp there.\\n\\nFirst of all, nothing beats the $1 oysters. All the other food items are good, but $1 OYSTERS! It changes up every day. That day, we had Fanny Bay. Paired with a spoonful of their mignonette and a squeeze of lemon made for perfection. Once I got past this amazing offer, the mac'n'cheese is one of the best. It is jammed pack with bacon and peas. \\n\\nAs for drink offers, check the list for the specialty cocktail of the day. I just stuck with an Old Fashion. It is not the best companion to the seafood, but cut the decadence of the mac well. \\n\\nOn my way out, I saw the advertisement for their date special. A three course meal for two with a select bottle of wine for less than $100. Hello?! Are you still on the Strip? I must come back for this one day.\\nLunch specials all the way. I forget when the lunch hour finishes, but I have gotten here around three and was still able to order off the specia\\nls menu. This is always the go to spot when I want to treat my parents to a meal. It is only becoming more difficult to convince them to go out with the economy, but with the mere mention of Capital they are getting ready. It has a lot to do with the prices, quality, and service.\\n\\nThe prices are cheap for the amount that you get. I am not a fan of getting a large plate of substandard and Capital Seafood does not make me feel like I am lowering my expectations.\\n\\nThe whole fried fish in sweet and sour sauce ($7.95) comes out so crisp that you can eat the bones around the edge. An order of kung pao tofu ($5.95) comes out looking like the Great Pyramids topped with whole chilies, peanuts, and chunks of scallions. My sister's favorite seafood chow fun in gravy ($7.95) is always hot and filled with gai lan and a variety of shrimp, fish cakes, imitation crab (only bummer), squid, and fish fillets. The Peking pork chops (6.95) are massive and plenty. I wish they were more crisp. The fried batt\\nering gets soft quicker than the ones at other restaurants. The bonus of being connected to the Vietnamese restaurant is that I can order a che ba mau. They make my favorite version in Vegas. I recently had a bad experience with this dessert at a different place, but Capital restored my faith. In the end, my mom and I packed up the leftovers and had enough food for the rest of the day.\\nFood-4-Less definitely lives up to its name. I am one for a deal, but there is something unsettling about this place. Besides for some produce and occasionally meat, I find that other places tend to have better quality and selection. \\n\\nIt is cleaner than other branches, but has that storage facility feel. Unlike Sam's or Costco, the dimmer lighting makes it feel less clean or cheerful.  That explains my run in and out policy.\\n\\nBe on the look out for cheap mangoes. If you ever see the three for 99 cents, buy them up because they are the best I have had in a long time. The larger selection of ethnic foods \", 'actual_label': 49, 'predicted_label': 49}, {'text': \"and spices are also a plus.\\nI am a huge fan of Costco and this one does not disappoint. We have been needing one in the southeast for some time now. \\n\\nI avoided the opening day crowd in fear of it being crazier than Costco normally is. I came on the second day and it was quite easy to get parking, navigate through the crowd, browse the selection, and check out. Even with 16 gas pumps down, it was easy to get gas as well. \\n\\nNow on to the selection. If you are a brown spirit lover, this might just be heaven. They had Middeton Very Rare, Kentucky Owl, Whistle Pig 15 year Rye, Lock Stock & Barrel 18 year Rye. These are not the easiest to find and definitely less expensive regular liquor stores. With that being said, they are not for the faint of heart.\\nFor a long time I was stuck in a rut and went to only one Mediterranean restaurant since it was close to university. Thanks to Yelp and other Yelpers I am trying all these new places now. Amena is by far one of the best I have tried yet. My \\nsister and I came here after a day at the Korean Spa. We had sweated out all the alcohol from the night before and came here for healthy food. \\n\\nThe restaurant is set up so that you order at the counter and then they bring the food out to your table. As we were looking over the menu, the owner came out and offered us a sample of their dolmades. These are probably one of the best I have ever had. The leaves are tender and the rice filling gave it a nice contrasting texture. Served at room temperature, it was hard not ordering some. We ended up getting the vegetarian plate ($9.99) which consisted of hummus, babaganoush, 4 falafels, tabbouleh, potatoes, Greek yogurt, and a salad. After the last encounter with tabbouleh, I never expected to eat it ever again. The previous restaurant made it entirely out of parsley and had me thinking I was eating grass. Not at Amena, theirs was a good mix of cucumbers, tomatoes, wheat, mint, parsley, and lemon juice. The babaganoush was magnificent. Light \\nand no one flavor was over powering. Like an ensemble cast, there was not one star, they all gave stand out performances. Like everyone mentioned, the falafels and pita are noteworthy. Moving on to the next plate, the Combo ($13.99) had beef and chicken shawarma, hummus, falafels, potatoes, and a salad. Ripping pieces of the pita and using my hands was my only thought. Utensils only slow down the eating process. Squirt some tahini and homemade hot sauce for perfection. Good thing they place a bottle of each on the table. I could not get enough of anything. Before we knew it, both plates were empty and all the pita was gone. \\n\\nIt is crucial to save room for desserts. Being a bakery, we wanted a cheese stuffed dough dish tossed in a honey sauce, but they were out. Instead, the owner recommended the cheese kanafeh. When it came, we were in awe. My sister guessed that it was phyllo dough, I thought it was vermicelli noodles. Looking it up, we were both right in a way. It is phyllo dough sh\\nredded up to vermicelli like strands that has a light spread of cheese, browned in butter, soaked in a simple syrup, and covered with crushed pistachios. \\n\\nI had got a Turkish coffee as well. This was my least favorite item. It was too loose. I am used to it being thick foam and almost sludge like near the end. I also appreciate it when it is sweetened for me. I ended up not getting any sugar added to mine because usually it is sweet enough, but not this time.\\n\\nWith the friendliness of the staff and the quality of food, I can't wait to go back.\\nMy three favorite things about entering a Great Harvest are: the warm greeting on initial entrance, the delicious smell lofting in the air, and the thick slice of fresh bread offered at the counter. \\n\\nThe way Great Harvest prepares their breads is one of the reasons why it is worth every penny. When you break into any of their loaves, the bounty of ingredients is clearly visible. For sandwiches, I love to get their cheddar garlic and have them s\\nlice it up. With bread like this, it is unnecessary to add any cheese to the sandwich or anything besides protein and veggies. I could make a meal out of it on it's own. Then follow it with some of their Sin Amen Swirl.\\nThe Mission: Find and devour what is widely considered the best of Vegas. \\n\\nThe Target: The Lounge Burger. In this case, the Lounge Prix Fixe Menu. This three course meal goes for a bargain at the low price of $29. To begin, there is a choice between a mixed greens or caesar salad. I had ordered the mixed and got the other by mistake. It was fine because that salad got devoured. Next came the star, the lounge burger and it was as fabulous as everyone makes it out to be. It must be one of the most juicy and tender burgers I have ever had. It comes with house made butter pickles, a field green salad, fries, and all the condiments on the side. There is also a choice of cheddar or bleu cheese to top as well. After devastating both courses, I was so full, but the butterscotc\", 'actual_label': 49, 'predicted_label': 49}]\n"
